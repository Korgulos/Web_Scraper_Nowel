Chapter 7: Capturing the Sentry! 
TL: Sungmin 
On a giant banyan tree, approximately 20 meters thick and 100 meters tall, with lush branches and leaves. 
The Elf Matriarch of this tribe, Lia, resided there. 
A slender elf, dressed in black stealth attire, leaped to the door and knocked, speaking urgently, “Mother, it’s me.” 
“Cassandra? Come in.” 
A woman’s voice answered from inside, very mature and gentle. 
Upon opening the door, Cassandra saw a mature woman meticulously breastfeeding a baby in her arms, a pristine and ample sight before her eyes. 
This mature woman had blonde hair, a long, fair face, golden pupils, and pointed ears. 
Her affectionate gaze exuded gentleness and charm. 
The scent of motherhood surrounded her. 
Her sensual figure epitomized maturity. 
The slender and youthful Cassandra could not compare to her at all. 
Seeing the visitor, the Elf Matriarch smiled gently, with great affection, “This little one is hungry again. No matter how many times a day I feed, it’s never enough.” 
The baby suckled greedily, milk even spilling from its small mouth. 
For others, feeding several times a day would certainly not suffice. 
But for the Elf Matriarch, her milk seemed inexhaustible. 
Cassandra, slightly shy, bowed her head and stammered, “Mother, I’m here to report a discovery.” 
“Go ahead, child.” 
Lia spoke calmly. 
“In the forest near the eastern edge, a dead black-brown giant bear was found, almost entirely devoured by monsters.” 
Cassandra reported. 
Such an occurrence warranted attention, as a single black-brown giant bear could devastate this Elven tribe. 
However, the black-brown giant bear had been killed, suggesting a terrifying presence. 
“Is that so? To my knowledge, only one creature in this enchanted forest is stronger than the black-brown giant bear, but it should live in the west. Any specific clues?” Lia asked seriously. 
Cassandra thought for a moment, “Based on the scene, a battle took place, but no trace of the victor was found. Besides many first and second-tier monsters scavenging, numerous goblin footprints were also discovered! Could it be them…?” 
“Goblins? Absolutely not. Those low-level monsters could never kill a black-brown giant bear, not even a hero variant goblin could do it. 
Moreover, the goblins in this enchanted forest are weak and negligible.” 
Hearing the word “goblin,” disdain and contempt filled Lia’s eyes. 
However, the lack of any trace of the victor was peculiar. 
Ultimately, Lia concluded, “It’s most likely humans. Only those cunning and evil beings could kill a black-brown giant bear without leaving any trace.” 
“Perhaps, Mother. I’ll take my leave then, and report back if anything else arises.” 
Cassandra flashed a sweet smile, cheerfully speaking. 
Lia gently patted her head, “Go on, thank you for your hard work, child.” 
… 
The next day. 
Cassandra hurried in again, “Mother, I’ve discovered a goblin!” 
Opening the door, she found not only Lia but also two male elves in the room. 
Startled, Cassandra screamed and retreated, her face instantly turning red! 
The two male elves quickly gathered their things and exited through the window. 
“Come, come in.” 
Lia’s somewhat hoarse voice sounded from inside. 
Cautiously peeking inside and finding only the matriarch, Cassandra finally entered. 
She noticed a deep blush still lingered on Lia’s mature, sensual face. 
The bed was very messy, with intimate garments strewn everywhere. 
Awkwardly, Cassandra greeted, “Mother, your bed…” 
“Cassandra, my dear child, never mind that. Tell me what you found.” 
Lia, also a bit embarrassed, quickly covered herself with clothing. 
Regaining her composure, Cassandra reported, “I found a goblin sneaking around the outskirts of the Myriad Forms Forest, acting very suspiciously.” 
“Daring to appear here? Did you not kill that disgusting creature?” 
Lia asked, slightly surprised. 
She knew goblins favored elves. At the ore outpost, goblins spying was a daily occurrence, not surprising. 
But no goblin had ever dared approach the Myriad Forms Forest. 
This was a first. 
Lia shook her head, feeling a bit frustrated, “I don’t know how I missed it, allowing that goblin to escape.” 
Elven archery was known for its precision, with misses being very rare. 
But not impossible. 
Lia embraced Cassandra like an infant, comforting her, “Child, it’s not your fault. It’s just a small goblin, it’s alright. Let it be.” 
“Alright, Mother.” 
Feeling much better, Cassandra prepared to leave. 
Lia called her back, her enchanting face showing a bit of shyness that made one want to cherish her dearly. “But child, next time you come in, please knock first.” 
“I, I understand, Mother!” 
Cassandra’s face turned red with embarrassment, and she hurried away. 
… 
Goblin Tribe. 
“Boss, there are about thirty elven treehouses in the Myriad Forms Forest, all very tall!” 
A goblin was explaining to Lin Tian, even borrowing the fingers of other goblins to count accurately. 
Lin Tian nodded, “Well done. I’ll reward you with two elves later.” 
“Two elves? Hahaha! Thank you, Boss! Long live the Boss!” 
The goblin sent out to gather intelligence shouted excitedly, his face contorting with joy! 
He was the goblin Cassandra had discovered. 
It wasn’t that the arrow had missed; it had hit the plate armor he was wearing and did not penetrate. 
Lin Tian began to ponder. 
Thirty elven treehouses, averaging two elves per house, though some might live alone. 
This meant at least sixty elves, and including the ten or so at the ore outpost, there were at least seventy! 
Each elf had an overall combat strength of about two hundred, which Lin Tian had checked at the ore outpost area. 
This was lower than his goblin subordinates. 
But the elves’ dwelling places were easy to defend and hard to attack, and they moved quickly. Normally, it would be impossible to take them down. 
However, they had hunted many first-tier ghost-faced monkeys and all had learned the “Climb” skill. 
They could easily climb trees. 
A nighttime raid could capture them all! 
Gobu Yue spoke up, “Boss, are we going to attack the elven tribe?” 
“That’s right, tonight, we’ll attack the elves! Produce more strong goblins then!” 
Lin Tian shouted, boosting everyone’s morale. 
Upon hearing this, instantly! 
The whole tribe responded with intense shouts! 
They all began sharpening their knives and preparing their armor for the night raid. 
Meanwhile, Lin Tian planned to use the Life Simulation System again to see if any unexpected events might occur that night. 
“System, start Life Simulation.” 
[The Life Simulation System is starting. Current scenario: The Night Before the Raid 
You killed the Goblin Priest and took control of this small tribe, greatly enhancing the strength of all goblins. 
The time is ripe, and you eagerly want to attack the elven tribe to build a stronger tribe and seek revenge against the Bearded Man and his group. 
In the dead of night, you silently lead your army to the Myriad Forms Forest. To avoid detection, you even replace everyone’s iron spears with daggers. 
You are confident, as your overall attributes surpass the elves, and it’s a surprise attack. 
Upon reaching the Myriad Forms Forest, the goblins climbed the treehouses, opened the doors, but found no elves! 
Looking back, the elves had hidden in the treetops beforehand and with their bows, overwhelmed the goblins, killing them all! 
You were not spared and were captured by the Elf Matriarch, who hanged you in the Myriad Forms Forest as a warning to the goblins. 
Summary: What seemed flawless was actually under someone else’s control. 
Score: 0 out of 100 
Reward: None 
This Life Simulation is complete, time progression: 0 days.] 
“What?!” 
Lin Tian snapped back, shocked at the complete failure and annihilation! 
What had gone wrong? 
What seemed flawless was actually under someone else’s control? 
Immediately, Lin Tian thought of a possibility—he was being watched! 
His cold eyes began to carefully scan the surroundings of the tribe. 
Finally, he spotted a figure dressed in black stealth attire hidden in the treetops, undoubtedly an elven sentry. 
He had been outmaneuvered! 
“I must capture her quickly, or it’ll be disastrous if she returns!” 
Lin Tian thought rapidly, determined not to let her escape and report back. 
But elves excelled at leaping between treetops, and goblins with their small bodies couldn’t catch her. 
He could only resort to shooting a hidden arrow. 
Elves had keen senses, so Lin Tian had the goblins start dancing around the bonfire to distract the elf. 
Lin Tian, holding a homemade bow and arrows coated with his own paralyzing venom, stealthily approached the elf from below. 
An open attack is easy to dodge, but a hidden arrow is hard to defend against! 
With all his strength, he shot an arrow at her! 
“Ah!”
