Chapter 129: The Terrifying Trophy Museum 
TL: Sungmin 
With the combined use of the long-distance magic teleportation array by the two Gilbert brothers, the three of them safely arrived at a teleportation point within the War Empire. 
Nations had agreements to establish fixed magic teleportation points for convenience. Given the vastness of the continent and underdeveloped transportation, rapid travel and communication depended on the teleportation abilities of mages. 
Upon entering the War Empire, the guards at the teleportation point respectfully saluted, “Greetings, Gilbert, Gilbus, and Your Majesty Edward.” 
“We are headed to the Dragon Slayer Guild,” Edward promptly reported.  
Being in such a vast empire, they dared not be too presumptuous. 
The soldiers immediately allowed them to pass. 
With Gilbert’s flight magic, it didn’t take long to reach the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Although within the War Empire, the Dragon Slayer Guild was not affiliated with the country, functioning more like an allied force. It had an independent, luxurious city where residents were primarily followers drawn to its renown. These were mostly fanatics, extremists, and powerful individuals who yearned for the guild’s recognition to become one of them. 
From a distance, they saw a city with a massive dragon head sculpture pierced by a long sword atop the gate. Slaying dragons was what the guild loved to do most. 
There were no guards, and the gate was always open, allowing free entry and exit. After all, who would dare attack here? 
The streets were filled with various eccentric people: strangely dressed mages, wandering bards, heavily armored warriors, and cautious assassins, among others. Besides those wishing to join the Dragon Slayer Guild, some visitors came mainly as tourists to admire the trophies in the Dragon Museum. 
“Your Majesty Edward, since we’re here, why not take a look at the museum?” the Gilbert brothers suggested with mischievous smiles. 
They had heard rumors about the numerous nude specimens of demi-humans inside and wanted to see for themselves. 
Edward had no objections. “Hmm, it’s a good opportunity to gauge their strength. We need to determine if we can deal with those three flying lizards.” 
Soon, they saw the massive, luxurious building in the city’s center, adorned with carvings of various monsters’ heads, all pierced by swords or other weapons. 
The guild’s characteristic of strength and violence was evident even from the exterior. Visitors came in an endless stream because admission was free, requiring only one’s shocked expressions. 
Entering the first floor of the museum, they found it spacious. At the far end, there was a giant red dragon head, estimated to be a hundred meters in size. Edward was slightly astonished, reading the inscription below the head: “619-meter Fire Element Ancient Dragon Head, Slayer: Hodras, Dragon Slayer Guild Rank 19.” 
Around it were various monster remains, mostly eighth-tier creatures like Thunder Bears and Human-faced Gorillas. 
While impressive, the three were not overly shocked until they reached the second floor, where the true terror of the Dragon Slayer Guild became apparent. The weakest remains were ninth-tier monsters, including two dragon heads: “688-meter Water Element Ancient Dragon Head” and “690-meter Thunder Element Ancient Dragon Head—Slayer: Laburando, Dragon Slayer Guild Rank 18.” 
Moreover, there was a heart of a tenth-tier monster: “Heart of the Berserk Blood Howler—Slayer: Kain, Dragon Slayer Guild Rank 17.” 
The remains of other ninth-tier monsters also bore the names of their slayers, but the most shocking were those three. Ancient dragons nearly 700 meters long had a strength of at least 5000, and the tenth-tier monsters exceeded 6000! 
Upon reaching the third floor, even they felt the true abnormality of the Dragon Slayer Guild. It was filled with tenth-tier monsters and even some eleventh-tier ones, including a dragon head over 700 meters long! 
The Gilbert brothers were delighted to see what they wanted, “Tsk tsk tsk, the corpse of the former Siren Queen, it’s really here!” 
“Ugh! So ugly! Weren’t sirens supposed to be beautiful?” 
Sirens and water demons were close relatives, both extremely hideous. However, sirens were more powerful, with queens possessing a combat strength of 7000-8000. 
Edward coldly explained, “A siren’s magic can create the illusion of beauty, but a specimen’s magic cannot maintain it.” 
“Bro! It’s a specimen of the Catwoman tribe!” 
“Tsk tsk tsk, look at that figure. It’s said that the Catwoman tribe has no fat people, every one of them a top-notch cutie!” 
“The specimen is driving me crazy, I want to buy it!” 
The Gilbert brothers discovered another treasure, excitedly exclaiming. “Specimen of the Catwoman Princess—Slayer: Karine, Dragon Slayer Guild Rank 29.” 
Edward found it rather boring. 
Then they headed to the fourth floor 
Upon reaching the staircase corner, they felt an extremely terrifying and chilling pressure. It was as if pairs of truly living eyes were staring at them. 
Once inside, they saw an array of ancient dragon heads, each at least 700 meters long. The most impressive were the 800 and 900-meter ones, killed by the top-ranked members of the Dragon Slayer Guild. There were also many remains of eleventh-tier monsters. 
But a large inscription conveyed an even more formidable message: “Please proceed to the fifth floor to view the trophies of the Dragon Slayer Guild Leader.” 
Edward’s expression changed, puzzled by the idea of one person occupying an entire floor. 
When they stepped onto the first floor, they were utterly shocked beyond words. There were so many incredibly impressive specimens that each could have been a centerpiece on any floor. 
“A 1000-meter Ancient Crystal Dragon’s Core Crystal.” 
“A 990-meter Dark Element Ancient Dragon’s Head.” 
“A 930-meter Composite Element Dragon’s Head.” 
“The specimen of a twelfth-tier monster, the Insect Emperor Dobas.” 
“The heart of the twelfth-tier monster, the Devil Island Fish.” 
“The eye of the twelfth-tier monster, the Calamity Eye.” 
“The feather of the twelfth-tier monster, the Paradise Bird.” 
“The arm of the twelfth-tier monster, the Destroyer.” 
“The head of the twelfth-tier monster, the Reaper Mantis.” 
“The head of the twelfth-tier monster, the Two-headed Rat King.” 
“And more twelfth-tier monsters…” 
There were over ten more, all twelfth-tier monsters. These were formidable rulers in their realms. Even if not all were killed, obtaining parts from them was enough to shock people for a hundred years. 
Even Edward stood with his mouth agape, unable to close it. Each label bore the same name: “One-Eyed Owl Elizabeth Tilly, Dragon Slayer Guild Rank 1.” 
Edward had heard of this person’s terrifying prowess, but now he felt it firsthand. The fierce battle cries seemed to emanate from each specimen, as if the intense fights were being replayed before his eyes, vividly demonstrating One-Eyed Owl’s power. 
After a long silence, Edward finally moved his feet, approaching the core crystal of the Crystal Dragon at the center. 
“The Crystal Dragon, which dominated the position of Dragon King for millennia, had its core crystal taken by her?! No wonder there’s been no news of the Crystal Dragon in recent years. Without its core crystal, it probably couldn’t survive.” 
Edward stared at the dark purple, mirror-like crystal over a hundred meters in size, imagining the epic battle between One-Eyed Owl and the Crystal Dragon. Trophies had to be claimed single-handedly to be displayed in this museum. Group efforts were not qualified for display here. 
Immediately, Edward pulled the two Gilbert brothers away, heading to the true Dragon Slayer Guild outside. 
A magnificent castle stood there, surpassing even royal palaces in grandeur and luxury. The plants around were eighth and ninth-tier monsters. After Edward revealed his identity as a king, they were reluctantly allowed entry. However, they proceeded cautiously within the palace. 
Everyone inside exuded a unique, powerful aura, deterring any provocations. 
“Damn it, why do I feel like everyone wants to kill me?” Gilbert cursed nervously. Despite having over 8000 combat power, he didn’t dare make eye contact with anyone passing by, feeling oppressed by their domineering presence. 
Edward wasn’t as affected, with over 9000 combat power, but even he avoided eye contact with others, knowing that some extreme and crazy individuals like One-Eyed Owl were present. He feared causing trouble and potentially not leaving alive. 
“Keep your heads down, don’t draw attention, and when we reach the guildhall, stay silent,” Edward instructed.  
The usually arrogant Gilbert brothers nodded obediently, not daring to make a sound. 
Soon, they reached the guildhall at the core of the palace, where most guild members relaxed. Though called a hall, it didn’t entertain outsiders; it was a place for the Dragon Slayer Guild members to eat, drink, and have fun. 
From afar, they heard the clinking of glasses. Pushing the door open, they saw dozens of people gathered, seemingly watching something. 
“Gulp, gulp, gulp…” 
“Bang!” 
The sound of a heavy mug slamming on the table echoed, followed by a satisfied exhale. A muscular, long-haired woman had downed a large mug of beer. She was the Dragon Slayer Guild Leader, One-Eyed Owl Elizabeth Tilly! 
With dark, healthy, wheat-colored skin and a bold, passionate outfit, she made Gilbert and the others gulp.  
“Keep it coming! Tonight, I’ll drink you all under the table! Hahaha!” Elizabeth’s voice was cheerful and excited. The two men across from her were already disoriented, one slipping off his chair to the floor, raising a white flag.  
Elizabeth laughed loudly, “Pathetic! Who’s next?” 
Meanwhile, more than ten people lay unconscious beneath the table.  
Then, they noticed Edward and his companions. The previously joyful gazes turned sharp and cold, like blades piercing their hearts.
