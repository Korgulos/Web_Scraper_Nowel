Chapter 192: Distributing Weapons, Completely Stunned 
TL: Sungmin 
“For the sake of profit, they actually want to kick us out? They’re worse than goblins!” 
“Even more despicable than beasts! We absolutely can’t let them get away with this. No matter what, even for Miss Persephia, we must fight them to the end!” 
Everyone was burning with anger. 
They sent one person back to report the situation. 
The rest stayed behind, unwilling to let it go so easily. 
They immediately set out, brimming with fury, ready to confront the Holy Tree Empire. 
In the distance. 
Lin Tian watched the scene unfold with a satisfied smile—this was exactly what he wanted. 
Before making a move, one had to think about the next step. 
Even if he dealt with these guys now, the three great empires would surely launch a coalition to attack him later. 
Though he wasn’t afraid in the slightest, it was best to avoid any bloodshed. 
If he could incite internal strife among the empires, he might even be able to reap significant benefits. 
As for those in the Holy Tree Empire, he decided to leave them alone for now. 
The Tree Spirit wasn’t easy to deal with; better to let the Giant Elephant Empire clash with them first. 
“Get out here! Luna! Don’t you think you’re being too excessive, too shameless? To do something like that just for profit!” Zolt stood outside the shop, cursing loudly. 
Soon after. 
The people of the Holy Tree Empire came out to see what was happening, all utterly confused. 
Luna was baffled, “Master Zolt, what do you mean by this?” 
“What do I mean?! You know exactly what I mean!” 
“You deliberately leaked information to the goblins. Don’t think we don’t know!” 
“You just want to kick us out, don’t you? Just because our two nations were mortal enemies before!” 
The people of the Giant Elephant Empire hurled accusations. 
They could tolerate their hatred for Lin Tian, but they couldn’t bear the actions of the Holy Tree Empire. 
However, they didn’t dare to make a move because of the Tree Spirit. 
Luna was utterly bewildered, “What are you even talking about?” 
Zolt steeled his heart, “Hmph, since that’s how it is, don’t blame us for flipping the table! We’ll tell the goblins about your true intentions right now!” 
“Wait, isn’t the Giant Elephant Empire overreacting? Can you explain in detail?” 
At that moment, Sara also arrived after hearing the commotion. 
Zolt then recounted everything, “Princess Sara, you must deliver justice for us!” 
“Luna, don’t you think you’re being too despicable and shameless?” 
Hearing this, Sara also became somewhat angry. 
The people of the Holy Tree Empire found themselves at a loss for words. 
No matter how much they explained, Zolt and the others wouldn’t believe them. 
If this continued, it could jeopardize the larger situation. 
Sara could only say, “Alright, even if your contribution is smaller at the time, you will still receive the recognition you deserve, how about that?” 
“Thank you, Princess Sara! That’s how an ally should act, not stab us in the back! Luna, our two countries are not finished yet!” 
Zolt flung his hand in frustration and stormed off. 
The atmosphere was awkward and tense. 
Luna’s face was full of grievance and helplessness, “This is insane, absolutely ridiculous! Hmph, if it’s a fight you want, don’t think the Holy Tree Empire will back down. We’ve never been afraid of anyone on our own turf!” 
“Alright, everyone, stay calm for the next couple of days. Don’t jeopardize the bigger picture.” Sara spoke coldly, then left. 
In the distance. 
Lin Tian smiled with satisfaction, “Just like that, huh? After taking you down, I should be able to declare war on that damn Joan of Arc, right?” 
Returning to the palace. 
A month had already passed. 
Now, with the three great empires plotting against him, it was time for a simulation. 
Let’s see what their action plan is. 
“System, start the Life Simulation.” 
[Life Simulation System is activating. Current scenario: The Sparrow and the Mantis 
The people of the three great empires are impatient to strike against you. 
In two days, on a night when the winds howl and the moon is full… 
Sara invited you out for a social gathering, and you eagerly went to her shop. 
Meanwhile, others have infiltrated the royal palace. 
Just as you were about to engage in some intimate activities within the shop, she used summoning magic to pull you into the Troy Arena. 
There, she could endlessly summon ancient Trojans to attack you. 
No matter how strong you were, you died in the endless onslaught. 
Simultaneously, numerous Trojan heroes and Holy Tree warriors infiltrated the palace, and the people of the Giant Elephant Empire hastily produced magical puppets, initiating a chaotic battle. 
Due to the surprise attack, aside from Alice and the One-Eyed Owl who held out for a while, everyone else met a tragic end. 
In the end, Alice escaped, and the One-Eyed Owl fought to the death. 
That night, they produced a large number of dragon-slaying weapons, causing the dragons to not dare approach, and all the dwarves were captured and sold to nations worldwide. 
Many people didn’t even realize that the Goblin Empire had a new king. 
Summary: Although you were prepared, you underestimated Sara’s power. Additionally, your excessive caution and failure to notify others led to their demise through carelessness. 
Score: 0 points (out of 100) 
Reward: 0 Life Points 
This Life Simulation is complete. Time elapsed: Two days.] 
Seeing this result, Lin Tian frowned. He hadn’t expected them to act so quickly and decisively. 
He himself had died too fast, without even a choice in the matter. 
But at least there was one thing he could do: warn everyone in advance to prepare for the ambush. 
That way, they could avoid being wiped out in an instant. 
He needed to summon the dragon clan and dwarves first, or their combat strength might not be enough. 
“Hmph, a sparrow and a mantis, huh? Too bad I’ll always be the sparrow, and anyone who comes will be the mantis.” 
Lin Tian squinted his eyes, coldly muttering to himself. 
He began making preparations. 
Gathering everyone together. 
“Boss, what’s going on?” Gobu Kuang asked, puzzled. It had been a long time since such a grand mobilization—last time was when they attacked the War Empire. 
The One-Eyed Owl and others had gradually integrated into this place and were getting used to it. 
Osius also chimed in, “It really does look like something’s up. How about you give me some noble title for my random lovers?” 
“I want one too, so I can do whatever I want in the streets!” Grugia quickly added. 
Lin Tian shot them a glare, “We’re a proper empire. If you really want that, show some strength and conquer an empire—then you can do whatever you want.” 
“Alright, what I actually wanted to ask is, does anyone here know projection magic, or any method that can create a large-scale projection?” 
Upon hearing this. 
Everyone was momentarily stunned. 
Projection magic did exist, but very few people knew how to use it. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s expression turned somewhat grim, “There was someone in the guild who knew that kind of magic, but he’s already dead.” 
“The old Pope knew how to…” Katheryn said solemnly. 
Osius suddenly spoke up, “Speaking of which, I remember there’s a type of insect in the Insect Tribe, called the Phantom Worm, that seems to have projection capabilities, though it’s usually used to confuse people.” 
“The Insect Tribe?” 
Lin Tian’s eyes lit up, but he quickly frowned again. 
He already owed the Insect Tribe a favor, and asking for their help again might not be easy. 
Moreover, the Phantom Worm belonged to the Insect Tribe Empire’s nobility, making it even harder to enlist their help. 
However, this seemed to be the only solution for now. 
If he could project his and Sara’s interactions throughout the Trojan Empire, it would utterly disgrace her, stripping her of any notion of honor. 
That would force her to abandon her plans to return. 
Even though the system simulation predicted his demise, he would be prepared this time. As long as the goblin forces struck first, she would have no chance to resist. 
He then said, “Go find an Insect Tribe member. If they can help, great; if not, forget it.” 
Worst case, he could devour all the Trojan heroes to gain their powers. 
Sara would be best kept for his use, but she wasn’t essential. 
Before long. 
The ant person who had cooperated with them previously appeared in the grand hall. 
His body was covered in a hard shell, with large, eerie eyes and two small antennae. 
His large, pincer-like mouth looked strong and powerful. 
“Your Majesty, long time no see~” The ant person greeted respectfully. 
Lin Tian didn’t bother with formalities. Instead, he got straight to the point, “The Phantom Worm, is it a noble in the Insect Tribe Empire?” 
“Yes, it’s similar in status to a marquis in a human empire,” the ant person nodded. 
A marquis. 
That meant it held a significant position, and considering it was part of one of the top empires, it wouldn’t be easy to enlist. 
Insect Tribes weren’t just any insects—they were like the ant-men, who were nobles in the Insect Tribe Empire, and even held a duke’s rank. 
The Insect Tribe Queen was a unique creature that could produce various types of insects depending on the situation, functioning similarly to an advanced version of the ant-men. 
Lin Tian continued, “I need some help from the Insect Tribe. Can you convey a message for me and ask them to send a large number of people?” 
Hearing this. 
The ant person patted his chest, “That’s easy enough. If our Ant Queen makes the request, they’ll definitely agree. But don’t forget, Your Majesty, these favors all come at a cost to the Ant Queen.” 
“Don’t worry, I always keep my promises,” Lin Tian replied with an “OK” gesture. 
The ant person then left. 
He used his antennae to send a message to a flying ant person, who would return to the Insect Tribe Empire to report. 
In a sense, they functioned like scouts. 
They had come to the Goblin Empire merely to observe and report back. 
But since both sides were inclined towards friendly relations, Lin Tian didn’t concern himself with such details. 
The One-Eyed Owl looked utterly confused, “So, what’s all this about? Are you going to show us something good?” 
Hearing this. 
Lin Tian’s expression turned serious, knowing he needed to explain this clearly. 
He spoke, “Two nights from now, the members of those merchant caravans that entered the city will disguise themselves and infiltrate here, planning to slaughter all of you. So, prepare the magic formations and be ready to defend.” 
“What?” 
“Wait, did I hear that right? Those caravan members are assassins!?” 
“No wonder something felt off. How could so many people and goods suddenly enter the city, as if it were all pre-arranged?” 
Everyone exclaimed in shock. 
The One-Eyed Owl clenched her fists, her disdain evident. “Hmph, I despise those sneaky bastards the most. If they dare to come, I won’t let a single one of them go!” 
“Big Sis, before that, you should at least grab a weapon. Fighting barehanded really limits your strength,” Lin Tian advised. 
However, the One-Eyed Owl shook her head confidently, “I don’t need one. Only when fists meet flesh can it truly be called a fight!” 
Osius, looking at his empty hands, asked, “Brother Tian, do you have any weapons? Can you hook me up with one?” 
“Me too, Brother Tian! I swear I’ll serve you loyally—no matter if it’s a mountain of blades or a sea of flames!” Grugia added. 
Lin Tian furrowed his brow slightly. “Aren’t you a transformation type? What do you need a weapon for?” 
“I use it before I transform… It’d be a huge waste to transform right away. You’ve got to save the big move for the finale,” Grugia explained. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian had to admit it made some sense. He then pulled out two world-class magical weapons. “Here, take these two swords and use them.” 
As he spoke, he casually tossed the swords onto the ground. 
He also distributed eleventh-tier magical weapons to the other members of the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Suddenly. 
The entire place fell into stunned silence!
