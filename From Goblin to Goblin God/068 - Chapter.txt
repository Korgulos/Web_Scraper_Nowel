Chapter 68: You Seek Trouble, I’ll Wipe Out Your Family 
TL: Sungmin  
“Boom!” 
At this moment, a ball of blue flame filled with demonic energy flew towards a giant rock ahead. 
It instantly exploded into fragments! 
Moreover, the flames continued to envelop the debris, burning without dissipating. 
They even reduced the stone to powder. 
Gobu Kuang grinned foolishly, “Haha, boss, I can use magic now!” 
“Hmph, what’s so great about that? Boss, I want to apply to eat more meat and blood. I also want to quickly reach level seventy.” Gobu Shan said, clearly dissatisfied. 
Gobu Tian felt the same way. 
All of them were resentful because their smaller appetites had left them behind in levels. 
Fortunately, it was only a difference of one or two levels. 
However, most of the meat and blood were from low-tier monsters, and even a one or two-level difference required eating a lot. 
They simply didn’t have that kind of appetite. 
It’s worth noting that when Lin Tian leveled up five levels, he had eaten the entire Niu Gui clan—over a hundred tons of meat and blood—in a day and a night. 
Along with those soldiers. 
Lin Tian certainly didn’t refuse, “Go ahead, I wish you would eat more meat and blood and evolve quickly. Each of you is so unmotivated to improve your strength; it’s a wonder you’re still alive, thanks to me.” 
Gobu Tian and the others felt awkward. 
They then prepared to eat the stored food. 
Lin Tian coughed heavily, “Ahem! What are you doing? This enchanted forest lacks everything except monsters. Go out and catch some yourselves; it will also improve your combat experience.” 
“Boss, it’s dangerous out there.” Gobu Dao said. 
At this time, Lin Tian’s eyes turned cold, “Do you think I’m very safe?” 
Gobu Shan quickly laughed awkwardly, “We’re going out right now, hehe… Boss, don’t be angry…” 
Lin Tian cursed, “Really gave you face, and you still want free food.” 
All this food was stored for the newly grown goblins to first increase their basic levels. 
Otherwise, in this enchanted forest, going out would mean death. 
Without any combat power, they were better off not going. 
“Boss, I’ll go help them. I feel a violent force within me that needs to be unleashed.” Gobu Kuang said at this moment. 
Lin Tian nodded. 
Just as they left, the Cannibal Eagle appeared again in the sky above the tribe. 
It slowly descended and said somewhat embarrassedly, “Little Tian, I want to introduce you to a lord.” 
Lin Tian quickly came up to greet it, “Oh? I’d be delighted to meet other lords.” 
It’s good to have more to fall back on. If you offend someone you can’t afford to, you can just name these guys. 
Not a loss at all. 
“As long as you don’t mind, it’s the one behind you.” 
The Cannibal Eagle pointed behind him. 
Lin Tian turned around and saw that at some point, a golden iguana had appeared there. 
It was at least three meters tall and looked identical to the lizardman from Spider-Man, except its scales were golden. 
If you didn’t pay attention, you’d think it was a pile of gold there. 
Those cold pupils were scrutinizing the breeding area of the Tian Kuang tribe. 
Full of desire. 
A slender tongue darted out from time to time to catch scents. 
Lin Tian first checked its attribute panel. 
Named ‘Golden Iguana,’ it was a subhuman species, level 88, with a strength of only 3990, not very strong. 
Then, pretending to be friendly, he approached and said, “Lord, are you interested in humans?” 
The golden iguana ignored him and continued looking at the humans in the cages. 
Then it turned to the Cannibal Eagle, “These humans look so delicious, birdman, let’s split them fifty-fifty.” 
Hearing this, the Cannibal Eagle was a bit dumbfounded, “Fifty-fifty? Didn’t you say just one would be enough?” 
Originally, it had brought him here after much pleading to eat a human, but now he wanted half. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian’s already unhappy face turned even gloomier. 
At this moment, the golden iguana said, “In our territory, aren’t all the things inside ours? Besides, this is just a goblin tribe, a low-level monster tribe of trash. 
Even if a goblin becomes a king, its strength at most would be like ours now, but we are different; we can still grow.” 
The Cannibal Eagle’s expression wasn’t good either, “Iguana, but here I call the shots. Please return to your southern territory.” 
“Stop pretending. Many in your tribe haven’t eaten humans, right? And you still call yourselves cannibal eagles? I’ve been fair enough, fifty-fifty. Let’s fight now, how about it?” 
The golden iguana continued, eyes full of greed. 
Lin Tian finally spoke coldly, “Hey, where did this reptile come from? Half, can you even eat that much?” 
Suddenly! 
The golden iguana let out a ‘hiss!’ sound, very creepy! 
It looked at Lin Tian with aggression and hostility, its eyes filled with murderous intent, “Are you talking to me, you low-level trash?” 
However, the Cannibal Eagle suddenly blocked Lin Tian, “Iguana, I’ll say this one last time, leave now, or you won’t be able to handle the consequences.” 
He had heard about Lin Tian’s feats. 
They even took care of the Sword Saintess, provoking humans to send an army of ten thousand to exterminate them, and even the Church got involved. 
It was evident that this was not an ordinary goblin tribe. 
The Golden Iguana still wouldn’t let it go, “You just want to hog these humans for yourself. Fine, I don’t want them anymore. Let me kill that small goblin!” 
Suddenly! 
The Cannibal Eagle let out a screech! 
The powerful sound wave forced the Golden Iguana to take a half step back. 
It wasn’t joking around. 
Seeing this, the Golden Iguana glared fiercely at Lin Tian, “Fine, birdman, you’re tough now, but there will be times when you’re not around. I’ll kill them all!” 
After saying that, the Golden Iguana disappeared into the darkness. 
“Sorry, I didn’t expect that guy to be so greedy.” 
The Cannibal Eagle looked at Lin Tian apologetically. 
Lin Tian didn’t mind, “No need to apologize. I was thinking, if I kill him, what will the people in the Great Tomb do?” 
The Cannibal Eagle was slightly surprised, astonished that he truly had such power. 
Then it said, “They might expel you, kill you, or perhaps make you the lord of the south. I’ll take my leave now.” 
Becoming the lord of the south? 
Lin Tian thought about it, feeling that being a lord was useless. It just allowed one to call on monsters. 
The key was that as a lord, he couldn’t wantonly kill monsters like he could now. 
He wouldn’t want it even if it was given to him. 
… 
In the enchanted forest. 
Gobu Shan walked at the front, looking around as if entering a buffet and selecting ingredients. 
“The iron-skinned rhinoceros is too tough, not tasty.” 
“The poisonous porcupine, it pricks the mouth.” 
“The devil dragonfly, not much meat.” 
As they walked, Gobu Shan kept complaining, “Oh, why isn’t there anything delicious? What do you think, Gobu Tian?” 
“Humans are still the best.” Gobu Tian said, leaping through the trees. 
Suddenly, they realized something was wrong, as if someone was missing. 
Turning around, they found Gobu Kuang gorging himself. 
One hand held the leg of an iron-skinned rhinoceros, while the other hand treated the devil dragonfly like a skewer, roasting it with a stick. 
As for the poisonous porcupine. 
He had already cut it open like an urchin and was preparing to taste it. 
Gobu Shan and Gobu Tian were dumbfounded, “Does this guy gnaw on every living thing?” 
“Stop eating. Let’s find something tastier, Gobu Kuang.” 
Gobu Tian said. 
Then, Gobu Kuang threw down his food and ran after them. 
After that, the path was littered with skeletal remains and pieces of flesh. 
As long as it was a fifth-tier monster or above, the three of them would kill and share it. 
They didn’t know how long or how far they walked. 
Or how many monsters they ate. 
Finally, Gobu Shan reached level seventy and began to evolve. 
Because the mutant variant was a special existence, once a mutation occurred, it would definitely mutate again during evolution. 
This meant that Gobu Shan could evolve into a mutant leader variant. 
The bone spurs on his body began to fall off, and he looked like an ordinary green goblin, exhausted and kneeling on the ground, in great discomfort. 
“How do you feel?” Gobu Tian asked curiously. 
Gobu Kuang, who had just finished evolving, explained, “It feels very painful, like being burned by a ball of fire.” 
“The boss said everyone’s evolution is different and feels different. Gobu Kuang, you’re too dumb to even remember the boss’s words.” Gobu Tian said, annoyed, looking at him. 
Feeling embarrassed, Gobu Kuang scratched his head. 
At this moment, Gobu Shan began to mutate, his bones making cracking sounds. 
His body grew long and slender, reaching over two meters in height but very thin. 
He looked like a bamboo joint. 
Then, every inch of his body started to grow bones, forming an exoskeleton. 
Until it covered his entire body! 
His head looked like it was wearing a skull helmet, making him look like a creepy white skeleton. 
“I feel like I’ve grown taller!” 
Gobu Shan said excitedly after completing his evolution. 
Gobu Tian swallowed, “Not only taller but also…” 
Gobu Shan ran excitedly to a puddle to check. 
One look and he was shocked. 
Touching his body, “Where’s my flesh! Why have I become a skeleton? Help! I need to find the boss!” 
“Don’t panic. We saw your flesh covered by your bones.” 
Gobu Tian said, looking at him like an idiot, speechless. 
He felt that Gobu Shan seemed even dumber than Gobu Kuang. 
After calming down, Gobu Shan finally understood his changes. 
He could control the bones on his body at will, forming long, sharp blades or solid shields. 
He looked thin, but was as hard as iron. 
Gobu Shan transformed his left hand into a giant bone shield and his right hand into a sharp blade, lightly swinging at a large tree in front of him! 
The tree fell instantly. 
A bump with the shield had the same effect. 
His strength had greatly increased. 
“Let’s go find something for Gobu Tian to eat so he can evolve too!” Gobu Shan said with a big smile. 
The three continued forward. 
Soon, they found many white bones piled up ahead. 
There were corpses of various animals. 
Approaching quietly, they saw a damp swamp ahead. 
On the swampy ground, many large grass huts were built, indicating a certain tribe lived there. 
Gobu Tian, with his keen eyes, spotted something, “Look over there, there’s something golden, like an iguana!” 
Gobu Kuang saw it too and said, “It looks delicious. Let’s eat, hehe!”
