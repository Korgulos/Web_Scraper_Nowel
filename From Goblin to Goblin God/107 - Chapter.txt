Chapter 107: The Arrival of the World-Class Magical Paradise 
TL: Sungmin 
Alicenia looked at them with a cold expression, her eyes filled with evil and murderous intent. 
She stood calmly in place. 
Facing Ferfis and his group’s fierce offensive, she instantly obliterated the foremost Temple Guard with just a single move! 
The heavy sword was cleaved into two, and the heavy armor could not withstand the current sword force. 
As blood spurted from the headless corpse, it was all absorbed by Alicenia’s left hand. 
“Don’t act rashly. If we get caught alone, we’ll be killed in an instant. Use magic to wear her down!” 
The cardinal felt unprecedented pressure. 
Ferfis and the others began casting their spells. 
Several beams of intense holy light shot straight at Alicenia. 
However, Alicenia evaded each attack with the grace of a waltz! 
Those holy beams struck and shattered numerous goblins. 
But none of them felt any joy. 
The cardinal thought, perhaps the Pope needed to intervene; they had to eliminate this dark entity at all costs. 
Otherwise, the consequences would be dire. 
“Evil and ruthless humans, you want me dead?” 
Suddenly, in the mere 0.5 seconds the cardinal was lost in thought, Alicenia flashed to his front. 
Her mouth emitted the deep, raspy voice of a dark being. 
The cardinal hurriedly swung his sword but struck only air. 
Turning his head, he saw that another Temple Guard had been slain. 
Basking in blood, an aura of sinister beauty emanated from Alicenia, elegantly claiming the life and blood of everyone. 
The cardinal now found it impossible to cast high-level spells and had to engage in swordplay. 
He also ordered Ferfis and the others to regroup. 
“Even two fists can’t fight four hands. Let’s attack together! As long as one strike lands, the holy power will suppress her!” The cardinal commanded. 
The four of them started to fight side by side, swinging their swords wildly! 
However, Alicenia stood with her sword in one hand, easily parrying their four-blade strikes with a single hand! 
She didn’t retreat a single step! 
She even seemed at ease. 
This scene made the cardinal begin to tremble with fear, his pupils shaking. “What kind of swordsmanship is this?! Only Reinhardt from the Kingdom of Swords can achieve this level, right?” 
The Kingdom of Swords was the enemy nation of the Lionheart Empire, with frequent border conflicts. 
Their king, Reinhardt, was hailed as the Sword Saint of this era. 
Alicenia had been known as the Sword Saintess, meaning the Saintess who used a sword, not a Sword Saint. 
But Reinhardt was a true top-tier swordsman. 
“Reinhardt? Does he deserve to be compared to me?” 
The dark being’s voice was full of disdain and even anger. 
Compared to swordsmanship, the dark being was born on the battlefield and grew up in slaughter. 
He had ruled over human fears of the battlefield for centuries. 
How could a mere person who might have only lived for a few decades dare compare with him in swordsmanship? 
It was simply an insult. 
The cardinal said nothing more and continued his fierce assault. 
But in the next second, 
A cracking sound came from the Holy Cross Sword in his hand! 
A crack appeared on the blade. 
“Snap!” 
Alicenia seized this moment and struck forcefully, shattering the Holy Cross Sword completely, representing her resolve! 
“Cardinal!” 
Ferfis and the others were in disbelief, swinging their swords to rescue him. 
But after swinging their heavy swords for so long, they were exhausted. 
It was too late. 
“Slash!” 
An arm flew out, accompanied by blood! 
The hand still held half of the Holy Cross Sword. 
Ferfis and the others, now rushing forward, were seeking their own deaths.  
“Your movements are too slow, and your blood reeks of stench!” 
Alicenia easily dodged, thrusting her sword into his heart with one strike! 
Ferfis’s pupils were filled with disbelief, the golden light in them dimming. 
He staggered back a few steps before collapsing to the ground. 
“Ferfis!” The fallen cardinal cried out in pain. 
He gritted his teeth and immediately got up to escape! 
Alicenia gave him no chance, flashing over to kill him. 
The remaining two Temple Guards launched an attack, forcibly holding her back. 
But they were only courting death. 
“Cardinal, quickly notify His Holiness the Pope!” 
Blood gushed from the necks of the two Temple Guards as they struggled to speak. 
The three shared a mutual understanding. 
The cardinal’s thoughts were the same; they had to call on the Pope, or the situation would be uncontrollable! 
Seeing him disappear into the crowd, Alicenia prepared to give chase. 
But the dark being stopped her, saying, “Wait, we can’t handle that guy behind him.” 
“Alicenia, don’t chase.” 
At this moment, Lin Tian also came over to dissuade her. 
They had just dealt with those five Temple Guards. 
Only Gobu Kuang and Gobu Shan were slightly injured. 
Lin Tian expressed his concern, “Can you keep suppressing that guy? Your body is already overtaxed and needs healing.” 
Although the swordsmanship just now belonged to the dark being, she was the one who wielded it. 
Such rapid sword swings and power must have placed a tremendous burden on her body. 
“Don’t worry, there are still so many enemies left. What will we do if we encounter danger later? Don’t you think?” the dark being said in a sinister tone. 
Alicenia also understood the situation, trying to control the Ominous Blade to completely suppress the dark being’s body. 
But it had no effect. 
The dark being continued innocently, “Once the war ends, I will naturally disappear. Didn’t your texts mention that? We appear with war and vanish when it ends. So, I won’t be a threat.” 
Alicenia pondered for a moment, “He seems to make sense. The Pope hasn’t made a move yet. His power…” 
“The Pope isn’t on the same level as us. Ifreya, use Purification.” 
Lin Tian nudged the dazed Ifreya beside him. 
Immediately, he cast an ultimate spell, Purification Light. 
It enveloped the entire Alicenia. 
“Stop! This feels like falling into a pit of filth! Don’t you guys have any morals? I saved you, helped you!” The dark being’s voice was filled with anger and curses. 
But Lin Tian showed no intention of stopping. 
He just wanted to repress this guy. 
Helpless, the dark being temporarily retreated back into the Ominous Blade. 
He believed there would be another opportunity later. 
Returning to normal, Alicenia staggered and almost fell. Her hands were bloodied and her body too exhausted to stand. 
Lin Tian, now in his big variant form, gently supported her. 
“Hurry, heal her wounds.” 
Ifreya quickly complied. 
In the distance. 
Charles II watched this scene, unsure of what to say, “Alicenia…” 
He then looked at the battling armies. 
His heart felt very empty. 
Having never married and having no children, he had long considered Alicenia his daughter. 
Seeing Alicenia stabilized, he felt relieved. 
However, he sensed that the scale of this war had begun to tilt. 
They might very well lose the battle. 
“Buzz!” 
Suddenly, in an instant, everything seemed to stop; time itself appeared to freeze. 
Soldiers in mid-swing with their swords also paused. 
In the air, the splattered blood hung suspended. 
The entire world turned gray. 
“World-class Magic · Kingdom Come…” 
A beam of golden light shot into the sky, shattering the frozen world! 
Everyone recovered. 
But they were all stunned by the golden shield above their heads. 
It was so large it enveloped the entire battlefield, even covering the entire Laiyang Plain! 
It was like being in a new world! 
All they could see was the radiance from the shield. 
“Boss, what is this? It feels so uncomfortable,” Gobu Kuang couldn’t help but say. 
Even Lin Tian felt uneasy, very oppressed. 
The cardinal reappeared, his injuries healed, his severed hand reattached. 
With a look of cold triumph, he said, “Surrender. The Pope has initiated Kingdom Come. You have no chance of winning.” 
Kingdom Come could weaken all monsters within its range by one tier while boosting all holy beings by one tier. 
Lin Tian frowned deeply, not expecting that old man to make a move. 
Why hadn’t Veronica and the others acted yet? 
Suddenly, a piercing, tragic scream sounded nearby. 
A Black Goat Spawn fell heavily, killed by a swarm of monks and cross guards. 
The goblins on the front battlefield were also being wiped out. 
Imperial soldiers, along with monks and nuns, began a counterattack! 
Leader variants turned into hero variants, hero variants into big variants, and big variants into low-level goblins. 
Low-level goblin attributes were suppressed. 
How could they fight like this? 
Previously, imperial soldiers feared the leader variants, but now they chased them down. 
“Ifreya?! You! Are you still alive!” 
The cardinal stared at the person beside Lin Tian, recognizing her and exclaiming in shock. 
She was once the most outstanding nun, chosen as a divine priestess, with great talent, potentially succeeding the Holy Mother. 
Now she squatted like a dog before a goblin! 
Mixing with monsters! 
No, the cardinal suddenly realized something was wrong. 
Ifreya, full of fear, pleaded, “Save me, I was enslaved by the goblins, cardinal!” 
Lin Tian provocatively looked at the cardinal and publicly humiliated Ifreya a few times. 
Ifreya blushed, seemingly enjoying it. 
But to cooperate with Lin Tian, she made a show of resisting. 
The cardinal was instantly enraged, “Damn you! Stop it! I command you to stop!!!” 
A divine priestess being publicly toyed with by a goblin. 
What did this mean? 
Blasphemy! 
Sacrilege! 
Even though Ifreya was no longer a divine priestess, she had still been chosen. 
She was still a member of the church. 
Lin Tian sneered, “Look at her, lying through her teeth! She looks so comfortable. If I stop, will she curse me?” 
“Ultimate Magic · Hand of Judgment!” 
Suddenly, two magic circles appeared before the cardinal, summoning a giant golden hand that snatched Ifreya back. 
Several nuns hurried forward to check her condition. 
Seeing Ifreya unharmed, they were relieved. 
Lin Tian licked his lips, “So many cute, beautiful nuns. Today isn’t a loss. Be gentle, capture them alive. I’ll figure out a way to deal with that old man.” 
Then, Lin Tian transformed into an imperial soldier. 
He headed towards the rear of the army. 
Where the old Pope was.
