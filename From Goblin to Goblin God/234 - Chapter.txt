Chapter 234: Archangel Gabriel 
TL: Sungmin  
Facing the attack, Lin Tian used the enhanced version of Ruinous Howl again to dodge. 
However, after using it twice in a row, his throat started to feel a bit uncomfortable. 
But Javier seemed completely unaffected, with no sign of her power diminishing.  
“World-class Magic · Judgment Execution!” 
Swish! 
In an instant, another intense beam of light shot out! 
Lin Tian was almost dumbfounded. “Does this guy have endless power? She used world-class magic three times in a row?” 
For most people, using it twice would be the limit. 
But there was no time to dwell on that. 
Lin Tian could only keep using the enhanced Ruinous Howl to dodge the attacks. 
He had initially hoped others would distract Javier while he found an opportunity to strike. Instead, he found himself completely suppressed. 
“Hmph, surprised, goblin? You have God’s Blessing, but we angels have God’s Blessing too! The more monsters there are, the more magic we have! Just accept your judgment!” 
Javier was incredibly proud, and the holy cross sword in her hand continued to emit a blinding light! 
Using world-class magic as if it cost her nothing, she unleashed another one! 
The ground was now full of deep craters, forming seven or eight bottomless pits! 
Lin Tian’s throat was practically raw. “Damn, next time I have to exchange for a proper movement skill!” 
Using Ruinous Howl as a movement skill was rather forced since it was mainly a control skill by nature. 
Fortunately, Javier was also showing signs of strain. “A goblin can actually use such a strange and powerful movement skill? Fine, I’ll judge you personally!” 
With a sudden flap of her pure white wings, Javier shot toward Lin Tian like a supersonic missile! 
Brandishing the holy cross sword, her eyes were cold, and the killing intent and hatred pouring out of her made one’s heart race with fear! 
Lin Tian’s expression shifted slightly, but a small smirk appeared on his lips. “Foolish angel, you’ve lost your advantage in the air. You should be more careful now.” 
“What?” 
Javier’s face was filled with confusion, and suddenly, a sense of danger tightened in her chest! 
Behind her, a surge of intense killing intent came rushing toward her like a fierce tiger! 
She hurriedly halted and turned to check. 
As soon as he turned, he saw One-Eyed Owl’s fist, burning with a red aura, smashing toward her! 
Boom! 
The fist collided with the holy cross sword! 
Sparks flew everywhere! 
Javier only retreated a short distance and hovered in midair without landing. “Another fallen one? I will try to save you, but before that, please fall!” 
“You think you can make me fall? Hmph, you can try!”  
One-Eyed Owl rubbed her wrist, provoking her. 
The two charged straight toward each other! 
Thanks to Lin Tian’s suggestion, One-Eyed Owl used gauntlets as her weapon, which allowed her to go head-to-head with Javier. 
Otherwise, she would have long been sliced into pieces by the holy cross sword. 
But after only a few moves, the gap in their strength became apparent. 
Sweat started to form on One-Eyed Owl’s forehead. She quickly shouted, “Kid! Hurry up! Every attack feels like I’m wrestling with a thousand-ton raging beast!” 
Every time she blocked, she could clearly feel her bones creaking in protest! 
Javier’s strength was overwhelming! 
And her speed was even more terrifying. She was already injured. 
“We angels, before taking our positions, were the powerful and righteous souls of this land! Elizabeth Tilly, I can sense that you’re not truly evil. There’s still time to turn back!” 
Javier tried to persuade her, her golden eyes shining brilliantly! 
One-Eyed Owl sneered disdainfully. “You want me to turn back just because you said so? That puts me in a difficult position!” 
As she spoke, she charged up a punch, and the sound of roaring dragons and tigers echoed! 
She forcibly knocked Javier back dozens of meters. 
“It seems I’ll have to use my full power against you…” 
Just as Javier was speaking, she sensed something and quickly dodged to the side, but it was too late. 
A small piece of her holy armor had been cut off by a Void Dagger. 
It was none other than the long-hidden Gobu Tian. 
“Evil and despicable monster!” 
With just one kick, Javier sent Gobu Tian flying hundreds of meters away, crashing into and shattering a stone mountain! 
Everyone else’s attacks were effortlessly blocked by the cross-shaped shield revolving around Javier. 
She didn’t care at all. 
Immediately, she rushed toward One-Eyed Owl. “Fallen one, fall!” 
She raised his holy cross sword high and drew a crescent arc in the air! 
It was about to come crashing down! 
One-Eyed Owl’s mouth twitched. “Hey, hey, you’re serious about this, Angel Lady!” 
She was about to give up resisting. 
At that moment, a familiar figure appeared. The Crocodile Demon King seized the moment when Javier was charging up, opening its enormous jaws and biting down! 
Its mouth was so wide that it swallowed Javier whole. 
“Did… did it work?” 
In the distance, Sara asked excitedly, her face full of hope. 
Everyone stared intently at the Crocodile Demon King. 
One second, two seconds, three seconds… 
Time passed slowly, and everything seemed to calm down. 
…. 
In the Heavens. 
The Holy City, Holy Square. 
Numerous pure white figures soared through the sky, and dozens of angels slowly descended. 
Among the group of angels, one stood out, cloaked in a red mantle. Her pure white wings were several times larger than those of ordinary angels. 
They could easily wrap around her entire body. 
Each feather shimmered with a faint golden light, creating a stunning spectacle! 
Beneath her main wings were four pairs of smaller wings. 
She was none other than the twelve-winged seraph, Gabriel! 
Her face, sacred and solemn, radiated authority. A single glance at her felt like a sin. 
“Your Grace, Archangel, you’re here. Javier… she’s already gone to the lower world, what should we do?”  
Loxie nervously asked as she rushed to greet her. 
Gabriel slowly sat down, and a grand, golden throne immediately materialized beneath her. 
She rested her slender, snow-white hand on her head, crossing her legs casually, allowing the luxurious scenery beneath her skirt to flicker in and out of view. 
After all, it was only female angels watching, so there was no harm in it. 
Gabriel spoke indifferently, “Javier, huh? That child is too impatient, but no matter. She is already an archangel, defeating those monsters shouldn’t be a problem.” 
“But, but…” 
Loxie was still filled with worry. 
Suddenly, Gabriel waved her hand gently, and a massive screen—dozens of meters wide—appeared in the sky above the square! 
On the screen was the scene of Javier in battle. 
Inside the Crocodile Demon King. 
Javier suddenly gathered her strength and swung her sword, slicing the entire Crocodile Demon King into pieces! 
The blade’s light formed elegant curves that lingered in the air long after the strike. 
In stark contrast to the exploding chunks of the Crocodile Demon King’s body! 
Everyone was stunned by the sight! 
Even Lin Tian couldn’t believe it. “The angels’ holy-type attacks are this effective against monsters? The gods are way too unfair!” 
A Demon King-level creature was like fruits and vegetables being sliced and diced in front of her. 
“This… this!” 
Sara was in despair. She had still hoped to resist, but now she understood how vast the gap truly was. 
Javier’s gaze locked onto One-Eyed Owl amidst the flying flesh and blood. 
Without a word, she instantly vanished from her spot! 
In the air, she gathered power again! 
Another crescent-shaped slash came crashing down! 
Dust billowed into the sky! 
The remnants of the insect monster on the ground had long since been scattered by the force of the previous battle. 
The earth roared, and when the dust finally settled… 
Javier stood there like a monarch descending upon the battlefield, with One-Eyed Owl lying unconscious on the ground beside her. 
In the heavens. 
The numerous angels in the Holy Square watched this scene with solemn expressions. 
Loxie, on the other hand, was ecstatic. “Ha, Javier is this strong? This is wonderful!” 
“Loxie, it’s not that Javier is strong, but that we angels are strong. We are natural nemeses of monsters,” Gabriel remarked nonchalantly. 
She showed no real interest in Javier’s fight. 
Loxie clasped her hands, deeply moved. “It seems that Javier made the right choice. Was I too cowardly and weak…?” 
At that moment. 
Seeing One-Eyed Owl down, Lin Tian seized his chance! 
This was the moment he had been waiting for. 
Using so much energy at once would definitely require a breather! 
“Anubis’ Soul Drain!” 
Swish! 
The phantom of Anubis appeared, aiming directly at Javier to harvest her soul! 
Javier looked incredulous. “How is this possible? This isn’t a monster skill?!” 
This meant she had no resistance to it! 
In an instant, Javier fell unconscious, her eyes rolling back as if she had lost consciousness. 
Lin Tian wasted no time celebrating and immediately hurled the Spear of Zeus! 
His target was the weak spot Gobu Tian had found earlier, the area not protected by her holy armor! 
However, to everyone’s surprise, Javier’s Holy Light Protection was a passive skill! 
Similar to Life Armor, it had an automatic defensive awareness. 
A cross-shaped holy shield appeared before her, and the Spear of Zeus embedded itself in it, just one centimeter away from piercing her flesh. 
“Unbelievable. A goblin that’s grown this powerful… I almost got hurt.”  
Javier woke up within seconds, astonished. 
Lin Tian’s forehead was drenched in cold sweat. 
That was his enhanced skill, yet it had only managed to control her for one second? 
Angels really were overpowered! 
Was this the so-called divine retribution? 
So far, though, she hadn’t used her truly overpowered abilities. 
Whether gods or demigods, they all had a signature skill. For example, Joan of Arc had her Divine Domain. 
It could suppress opponents and allow her to perform miracles within it. 
She wouldn’t die unless fatally wounded. 
Angels, on the other hand, shared a unique divine skill, Ultimate Judgment. 
Given the current situation, Lin Tian knew he wasn’t a match for Javier. “Everyone, we should retreat!” 
Based on their earlier conversation and the fact that One-Eyed Owl wasn’t dead, it seemed Javier wouldn’t kill her. 
So retreating wouldn’t hurt anything. 
“This guy… really is a bit of a monster.” 
Osius and the others wore grim expressions, fully aware that they weren’t a match for her. 
Long-range attacks weren’t their specialty, and they could barely help with distractions. 
Little Black and Spark didn’t dare get too close, fearing they’d be killed instantly. 
Alice was still in a daze nearby. 
Lin Tian decided it was best to retreat for now. With the help of the system, the next time would be the moment to take her down. 
Gobu Yue had already packed up. “Let’s go, Boss. You can’t win every time, especially when it’s our first fight against an angel.” 
“Yeah!” Lin Tian nodded. 
“Lin Tian, are you feeling what it’s like to have someone steal your victory? Not a pleasant feeling, is it?” 
A familiar voice echoed from afar. 
Veronica slowly approached, holding her staff, her Scarlett eyes glowing like eerie ghostly flames!
