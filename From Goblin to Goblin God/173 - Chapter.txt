Chapter 173: A Friend’s Success is More Painful Than One’s Own Failure! 
TL: Sungmin 
Punch after punch. 
It was unclear if the One-Eyed Owl was still conscious, but her desire to pummel Landau to death had never wavered. 
At that moment. 
Luen noticed a bottle of super recovery potion that had fallen from Landau’s body earlier. “Big Sis, quick, you should recover first.” 
However, the One-Eyed Owl didn’t respond. 
She was still busy. 
Frantically hammering away. 
Lin Tian felt a twinge of fear in his heart. “Damn, those guys earlier said I was scary? Isn’t this even more terrifying?” 
“This is the friend Boss knows? Even in such a weakened state, she doesn’t forget to take revenge first? She’s way tougher than us,” Gobu Kuang remarked, still feeling a sense of dread. 
Even Alice and the others felt inexplicably creeped out. 
Finally, the One-Eyed Owl snatched the potion from Luen’s hand. 
But instead of using it to heal herself, she poured it onto the bloody, mangled Landau! 
“What the hell?”  
Lin Tian was stunned, “Big Sis, that’s too ruthless… You’re seriously injured too…” 
Gobu Kuang was completely in awe, his mouth hanging open in speechless shock. 
Who saves their enemy first? 
The key point was that this didn’t seem stupid—just incredibly ruthless. Truly, a madwoman! 
Everyone watching couldn’t help but click their tongues in disbelief. 
“No! Don’t save me! Just let me die! You demons, you lunatics!!!”  
As the potion restored him, Landau screamed out in agony. 
The One-Eyed Owl chuckled coldly, raising her blood-soaked, flesh-covered fist and slamming it down again! 
She hit him so hard that he was left with no fight left in him. 
Where before he could still spit out a few defiant words, now he only wished for death. 
Unfortunately, she pummeled him until he was half-dead, not killing him outright. 
His head, a bloodied, unrecognizable mess, kept twitching and convulsing! 
It was extremely unsettling. 
The One-Eyed Owl finally seemed to have vented some of her anger. She turned to Lin Tian, grinning, “Kid, you’re more impressive than I imagined. Thanks a lot…” 
As soon as she finished speaking. 
She collapsed to the ground, no longer able to hold on. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but chuckle bitterly, “Alice, can you take her out to let Katheryn treat her? I’ll go save the others.” 
“No problem.” 
Looking towards the depths of the dungeon. 
Lin Tian moved forward, his expression heavy. He passed by several familiar faces from the Dragon Slayer Guild, all dead, some even starting to rot. 
There were also a few barely clinging to life. 
He immediately instructed Gobu Kuang and the others to take them out for treatment. 
“That guy got off too easy.” 
As he spoke, he finally saw Grugia and Osius among the captives in the back. 
They had all passed out, with only Osius still clinging to a shred of consciousness. 
Both his hands and feet were hooked by large black iron hooks, suspended in the air. 
It was unimaginable how much they had suffered. 
To have endured this long was remarkable. 
Osius instantly became alert, “A goblin? Why are you here?” 
But then something seemed to dawn on him, and he changed his tone, “Hehehe… Hey, Goblin Majesty, can we talk? How about you let me down?” 
What the hell? 
Lin Tian was taken aback. This bastard still had so much energy left. He had thought Osius was on the brink of death. 
As expected of a seasoned cultivator, tempered by a strong will. 
But that despicable, shameless expression made Lin Tian feel uncomfortable. He sneered, “You want me to save you?” 
“Yes, yes, yes! As long as you save me, I’ll give you anything you want!” 
Osius tried his best to lower his voice. 
Lin Tian pretended to consider, “Alright, then I want your pi yanzi (euphemism for anal virginity). Will you give it to me?” 
As he spoke, he quietly moved behind Osius. 
In an instant. 
Osius felt a chill creep up his spine, “Hey? Goblin Majesty, don’t mess around. That thing isn’t worth much. Look, that guy over there is strong and sturdy! Why don’t you take…” 
“But I like your type the most. Will you give it to me or not? If not, I’m leaving.” Lin Tian said. 
Osius’s face twisted in frustration and helplessness, “For everyone’s sake, I’ll sacrifice myself. Don’t leave, Goblin Majesty, come on.” 
Suddenly. 
Lin Tian transformed into his human form, Andy, and scoffed, “Osius, I didn’t expect you to be so disgusting, willing to offer up your most vulnerable part, tsk tsk tsk!” 
“Huh? Rookie? What are you doing here? Where’s that goblin from earlier?” 
Osius was dumbfounded, looking around frantically. 
In an instant, he noticed that Lin Tian had vanished, and the goblin was standing before him. 
In another instant, Lin Tian turned back into Andy, “Stop looking, I’m Andy, and I’m also a goblin.” 
Such an overwhelming amount of information. 
Osius wondered if he was about to die; otherwise, how could something so bizarre be happening? 
Osius lamented, “God, are you really toying with me like this? About to die, and yet you still tease me? That’s just too cruel…” 
“Wake up, you’re not dreaming.” 
Lin Tian slapped him awake. 
Osius was shocked, “It’s real?! You little bastard! You actually dared to mess with me?!” 
“So what if I did? Who are you calling a bastard?” 
Lin Tian reached out and jiggled the iron hook that was impaled into Osius. The sudden surge of pain almost made Osius soil himself. 
He felt both clear-headed and overwhelmed, his expression changing five times in a single second. 
Finally, he pleaded, “My ancestor, please let me down! I haven’t taken a shit in days; if I hold it in any longer, I’m going to start digesting it!” 
Hearing this, Lin Tian finally relented, “Alright, bear with it.” 
He yanked out the bloodied hook. 
Osius’s expression changed dozens of times in just one second, but he managed not to scream out. Instead, he cautiously began to help rescue Grugia, saying, “Quick, let’s save this guy and then get Big Sis out of here. We should escape first and come back to rescue the others later. Damn Landau, how is he still not dead?” 
“Hey! Somebody get over here!” Suddenly, Lin Tian called out loudly. 
Osius nearly jumped out of his skin, feeling like he had aged ten years, “Are you crazy? In this place…” 
“Boss!” Gobu Kuang and the others rushed in. 
Lin Tian nodded, asking, “How are the ones we brought out? Have they been healed yet?” 
“They’re still being treated, but they won’t wake up anytime soon,” Gobu reported. 
Lin Tian then pointed to the members of the Dragon Slayer Guild around them, “Take them all out as well.” 
“Got it!” 
Only Osius stood there, wide-eyed and frozen like a statue. 
What was happening in this world? Was he dreaming? So many goblins! 
Even as they carried him out of the dungeon. 
He stared in disbelief at the grand army and the dragons filling the sky! 
His eyes never blinked, and his breathing trembled. 
Holding his head in his hands, he felt like he could hardly breathe, “W-What is all this? Am I still in the human world?!” 
“Boss! We’ve killed all the escapees!” 
“There’s nothing unusual around us!” 
“What’s the next move?” 
At that moment, dwarves, dragons, goblins, and powerful monsters all respectfully reported to Lin Tian. 
Lin Tian replied calmly, “Regroup here, and in ten minutes, we’ll advance on the War Empire’s royal city!” 
“Yes, sir!!” 
Seeing this, Osius felt his scalp tingle, and his hair stood on end! He grabbed Lin Tian, “Tell me this is just a fantasy before I die, right? I’m sorry!” 
It wasn’t that they were mentally fragile or on the verge of collapse at the drop of a hat. 
But the scene before them was truly overwhelming! 
The sight of dragons filling the sky alone was enough to make an ordinary person faint. And then there were so many goblins. 
From a distance, dark energy surged skyward! 
The sun grew dim, dark clouds churned overhead, lightning crackled, and it was utterly terrifying. 
“Someone, treat his head.” Lin Tian ordered. 
When Osius saw the One-Eyed Owl being treated, he burst into tears, “You damn bastard, why did you hide so much from us? Your identity is so impressive!!!” 
Compared to his own failures! 
His friend’s success caused him even more pain! 
As he looked around, Osius, ignoring his injuries, stood on the high wall, staring out, “Oh my God! This spectacle… Goblin King? No, no, there’s no way a mere Goblin King could achieve this!” 
Just the dragons filling the sky above were already an apocalypse-level threat. 
And then there were the dwarves who had vanished for decades. 
“Damn it! Andy, you really should die! Why are you so impressive?!” 
Osius wiped away his tears, cursing through his sobs. 
He even wished he could go back to being imprisoned in the dungeon, waiting for death, rather than seeing this once-rookie achieve such greatness. 
Lin Tian shot him a glance, “Increase the dosage!” 
Osius was finally dragged away for treatment. 
Before long. 
The One-Eyed Owl was the first to wake up. Her injuries weren’t actually that severe; it was just that she hadn’t eaten in days and had been stuck in that position, leading to exhaustion. 
She immediately sought out Lin Tian, “Kid, what’s going on? I knew you were a monster, but I didn’t expect you to be this impressive! Ancient dragons, all out in force? It’s breathtakingly beautiful!” 
She raised her head, gazing at the dragons filling the sky. 
The One-Eyed Owl felt a shock and exhilaration like never before! 
Lin Tian finally explained, “I’m the newly risen King of the Goblin Empire. Also, these dragons are here to rescue you.” 
“To rescue us? Osius, get me a couple of spears to pin me back up.” 
The One-Eyed Owl turned around, looking regretful. 
She continued, “So many ancient dragons… I really want to dance among them. Why are they here to save me?” 
Lin Tian was at a loss, “Alright, Big Sis, put your crazy ideas away for today. Come with me to the War Empire.” 
Hearing this. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s eyes lit up, “Oh? You’re going to attack the War Empire??” 
“That’s right. Saving you means we’ll end up at war with them eventually, so the best plan is to strike first, before they can fully prepare.” 
Lin Tian replied, “The War Empire is a great empire, after all. If they have time to fully prepare, there’s no telling if we could handle them.” 
“Not to mention, there are several hungry wolves outside, waiting for an opportunity.” 
The One-Eyed Owl looked at him with admiration, “Your plan is excellent. Let’s go!! I have a score to settle with Alexander as well!”
