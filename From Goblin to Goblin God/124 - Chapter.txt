Chapter 124: One-Eyed Owl, President of the Dragon Slayers 
TL: Sungmin 
“I know where to find this thing, but…” Alice suddenly spoke up. 
Hearing this, Little Black transformed into her humanoid form. Despite her body already being a kilometer long, the humanoid form still looked like a child. 
Scar and Thunder Calamity also shifted to their humanoid forms. 
The dragon lived up to its name. 
Scar wore brown armor, resembling a middle-aged man with many scars on his face. 
Thunder Calamity had white hair, looking as striking as a beautiful man. 
Little Black quickly asked, “Big Sis, hurry and tell me!” 
Big Sis… 
Alice wanted to retort in her mind, thinking she wasn’t older than Little Black, but she explained, “Of course, it’s the Dragon Slayer Guild. I remember their trophy museum has the largest dragon crystal.” 
This guild had a heritage spanning over a thousand years. 
It wasn’t bound by any nation and was even on par with the Empire. 
The guild members were top-notch fighters or extreme individuals. 
They often showcased the prey they killed as trophies for others to see, symbolizing their honor. 
They had killed countless dragons, but they didn’t limit themselves to just dragons. 
Powerful monsters were also their targets. 
Over time, they accumulated so many trophies that they opened a museum. 
“The Dragon Slayer Guild? Where is it? I’ll go right now!” Little Black said excitedly, without any hesitation. 
Everyone almost fainted. 
You are a dragon. 
And that place is called the Dragon Slayer Guild! 
Isn’t that walking into the lion’s den? 
Alice was also helpless, “Although you’re very strong, there are many powerful experts there, and there’s a renowned One-Eyed Owl whose strength even the old pope couldn’t match.” 
“One-Eyed Owl? That guy was from the Dragon Slayer Guild? She tried to hunt me down a few times.” 
At this moment, the voice of Veronica, who was hanging on the city wall, rang out. 
Lin Tian then realized and pulled her up, “Thank you for your hard work, although it didn’t help much.” 
Veronica’s face was cold, and then she said, “She is a very formidable woman, wild and unrestrained, with beautifully toned muscles and healthy, strong brown skin…” 
As she spoke, her face was full of longing. 
Being a lesbian, she couldn’t help but admire a woman with such strong masculine attributes. 
Of course, she said so much purely to answer Alice and the adorable Little Black. 
Lin Tian directly had Gobu Jian capture and lock her up. 
She said so much without getting to the point. 
“Wait, I still want to see Alice and this dragon. Katheryn seems nice too. Help me regain my strength, and I can make you happy!” Veronica resisted strongly, her eyes staring intently at them. 
Lin Tian frowned slightly, “Then give us some useful information.” 
But when looking at Lin Tian, Veronica was utterly disdainful, “Hmph, I won’t tell…” 
Before she finished speaking. 
Little Black tugged at her cloak, looking up at her with big eyes, “Can you tell me more about the One-Eyed Owl?” 
“One-Eyed Owl, real name Elizabeth Tilly, female. 
Age 29, dark skin, likes challenging powerful prey. 
Height 180, measurements 100, 60, 90…” 
Veronica answered seriously. 
Scar’s face darkened, and he shouted, “Get to the point!” 
“Wait!” 
Lin Tian raised his hand to interrupt him, “This is also a point, ahem.” 
From the description, she was a dark-skinned muscular beauty with a great figure. 
“She’s a half-god and human hybrid, essentially a demi-god. Her strength is not inferior to mine. It’s said she has now become the president of the Dragon Slayer Guild, located in the War Empire’s capital.” Veronica continued explaining. 
Upon hearing this, they finally got some crucial information. 
War Empire? 
Lin Tian thought carefully, realizing the Dwarf Kingdom was within this region. 
Their mythological system seemed to be Greek mythology, associated with Zeus and his cohort. 
This empire was not to be trifled with. 
It was among the top superpowers on the continent. 
Why? 
Because they had many top-tier experts, all demi-gods created by Zeus, Poseidon, Ares, and the like. 
To put it nicely, they were illegitimate children; not so nicely, they were bastards. 
But they possessed real divine power and exceptional combat abilities. 
“Alright, Scar, let’s go!” Little Black decided immediately to set off. 
But Scar and Thunder Calamity remained unmoved, looking bitter. 
They had no confidence in fighting demi-god hybrids. 
Lin Tian also stopped her, “Things aren’t as simple as you think. Leave the dragon crystal matter to me. You all should go back or stay here for a couple of days.” 
“But…” 
Little Black still didn’t give up. To her, you wouldn’t know if you could win until you tried. 
Lin Tian pushed her towards the square to get some food. 
He was well aware of Little Black’s battle capabilities. 
Her combat power was currently at 9000, a growth rate that was astonishing. 
But even she couldn’t defeat the One-Eyed Owl, Veronica said. 
Her combat power must be over 10,000, and she specialized in slaying dragons. 
It would only lead to death. 
Having over 10,000 versus not even reaching 10,000 made a world of difference. 
“Gobu Yue, entertain our guests.” Lin Tian ordered, roasting a large quantity of beef and mutton.  
They didn’t have such things to eat under the World Tree. 
Beef and mutton were considered top delicacies. 
Then, he called a large number of goblins to handle the soldiers’ corpses. 
There were tens of thousands of them, and even with thousands of goblins, it was a huge task. 
After a busy day, evening came. 
Gobu Kuang was very excited, finally having something to devour to evolve into a king variant. 
He was the most diligent in collecting the corpses. 
“Stop it, I’m busy! Seriously.” 
Suddenly, Gobu Kuang felt someone touching his butt. 
But even after speaking, it didn’t stop. 
Instead, it became even more wanton! 
Frightened, Gobu Kuang clenched and quickly dodged, “Who are you? Be careful, or I’ll deal with you!” 
He thought it was Gobu Tian and the others. 
However, in front of him was a pale-faced ghost, crawling onto him. 
“Ghost! Boss!” 
Gobu Kuang, who had never seen a ghost before, was encountering one for the first time. 
Terrified like a small child, he ran off in a panic. 
Regardless of race, as long as there was intelligence, fear of ghosts was common. 
And now, he was genuinely seeing ghosts. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian, who was busy in the distance, turned to look, and even he was startled! 
In the darkness. 
Countless spirits appeared, their faces full of anger, hatred, and ferocity! 
They were clearly extremely vicious ghosts. 
Spirits could ignore physical boundaries, while the opponents could still attack, which was quite unfair. 
They were essentially immune to physical attacks. 
Only magical attacks would work, as elemental attacks were mostly physical. 
“Kill them!!” 
In the center of the twenty thousand spirits, a spirit radiating intense ghostly energy roared ferociously. 
Even in spirit form, it wore intricate armor, indicating it was the leader of the soldiers before death. 
Upon receiving the order. 
A large number of spirits charged at Lin Tian and his group. 
“Damn it, Holy Mother! This is for you to handle!” Lin Tian cursed, quickly running into the city. 
Gobu Kuang tried slashing a few times with his weapon but ended up getting bitten, losing chunks of flesh. 
He screamed in pain. 
“Idiot, retreat to the city! These are ghosts, you can’t kill them!” Gobu Tian and the others scolded. 
In the square. 
Katheryn and the others were still enjoying the bonfire and barbecue. 
Then they saw Lin Tian and his group rushing over. 
Gobu Yue couldn’t help but be curious, “Hmm? Are they done already? I just grilled a few pieces of meat for the boss.” 
“Why are they running so fast?” Little Black was puzzled. It couldn’t be that urgent, right? 
The next second. 
Everyone’s expressions changed. 
Scar’s pupils shrank as he saw the ghostly blue spirit army ignoring the city walls and charging straight in, and he jumped up in alarm. 
“Shit! It’s the undead army! We need to run!” 
“Holy Mother! Use holy magic!” Lin Tian shouted from afar. 
Upon hearing this. 
Katheryn, who was sitting on the ground, stood up and was startled by the massive number of spirits. 
She had recited holy scriptures to put them to rest before. 
It seemed their resentment was too deep, and they couldn’t find peace. 
“Ultimate Magic · Gate of Heaven!” 
A magical barrier, previously used by the Lord of Clinforth, appeared behind Lin Tian and the goblins. 
It was immense and grand, like it separated the whole world. 
It blocked all the spirits outside. 
Since it was a holy defense magic, the spirits couldn’t pass through. 
Lin Tian finally breathed a sigh of relief, the sheer number of spirits was terrifying, enough to make one’s scalp tingle. 
Katheryn looked sorrowful, “Poor soldiers, not even finding peace in death. Let me send you to heaven.” 
These soldiers turned into spirits because of their resentment after Edward and his men fled. 
The soldiers at the Laiyang Plain were prepared to die and didn’t expect to return alive. 
So they didn’t become spirits after death. 
“Wait, I feel we can use these guys to our advantage.” 
Lin Tian approached the barrier, looking at the spirit leader.

Lawrence, with half of his face a skeletal white, stared at Lin Tian with vicious eyes, “I will kill you for revenge!” 
“Why kill me? Wasn’t it your king who got you killed?” Lin Tian asked. 
Lawrence tilted his head in thought and answered, “All of you deserve to die! But don’t think you can evade responsibility, you killed us!” 
“That’s true, but the biggest issue was your king starting the war and sending you to die. Why not join us and seek revenge on them? Otherwise, this number of spirits is nothing, we can easily wipe you out.” Lin Tian suggested. 
Upon hearing this. 
Lawrence pondered, “What happens after we kill Edward and his men?” 
“I’ll have the Holy Mother send you to heaven. Let’s call it even. Otherwise, you won’t achieve anything.” 
Lin Tian pointed behind him. 
For a moment, Lawrence hesitated. 
Indeed, if they fought, they wouldn’t stand a chance against the Holy Mother. If it were attack-based clerics, it would be easier. 
But the Holy Mother could purify, wiping them out in a few moves. 
Finally, Lawrence nodded, “Alright, I’ll cooperate with you!”
