Chapter 176: Joan of Arc Reappears, The War Empire is Annihilated! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Yes! It’s the One-Eyed Owl! Run!” 
A Titan Warrior, manning a heavy crossbow, turned to flee the moment he saw her. 
He didn’t even care about the threats from the overseer knights! 
He preferred taking his chances with the overseer’s punishment over dying at the hands of that maniac. 
Seeing this, the overseer knights lined up, spears in hand, and commanded, “Hold the line!!! No retreating!!” 
Every nation had overseer squads to prevent desertion during wartime, as any signs of retreat could severely impact morale. 
The overseer knights were highly skilled, and one of them immediately pierced the fleeing Titan Warrior, lifting him into the air with sheer force! 
“Take a good look! This is the fate of a deserter…” 
Just as the overseer knight turned to warn the others, the sight before him froze him in fear. 
The One-Eyed Owl had already charged up to one of the giant crossbows, a smirk on her lips. “Heh, what fun are these toys? Let’s have a real brawl!” 
“Swish, swish, swish!” 
Her fierce punches roared through the air! 
She shattered one of the crossbow carts into fragments with a single strike! 
In the next moment, she grabbed a Titan Warrior by the finger and swung him around like a massive hammer! 
In the blink of an eye, she had smashed numerous crossbows to pieces. 
Any Titans who tried to approach were sent flying by her blows. 
A spinning whirlwind! 
Dozens of Titan Warriors were sent hurtling into the air! 
The debris from the crossbows scattered everywhere! 
The scene was so overwhelming that the nearby warriors, who had been trying to defend the crossbows, all turned and ran. 
They’d rather face the wrath of the overseer knights than end up being smashed like that, their brains turned to mush. 
“This… this lunatic!” 
Even the overseer knights turned tail and fled. “Captain Corto! The One-Eyed Owl has broken through! You have to do something—she’s destroying all the dragon-slaying weapons!” 
Hearing this, Corto’s face turned grim from a distance. “Damn it, we can’t even handle things over here! Is… is our War Empire really going to fall?!” 
For a moment, everything seemed to stop. 
The goblins broke through the defenses, and together with the One-Eyed Owl, they quickly destroyed all the dragon-slaying weapons. 
The few remaining weapons were abandoned, as no one dared to operate them anymore. 
Everyone retreated. 
The final defense line, made up of a million soldiers and a million militia, collapsed the moment the dragons appeared! 
“Captain, what should we do?!” 
Facing the onslaught of dragons, the soldiers gave up resisting and fled alongside the overseer knights. 
The enormous body of the Flame Dragon Mother loomed over them, exuding a suffocating pressure! 
Her eyes were as clear as pearls, and when she opened her mouth, filled with sharp teeth, a glow began to emanate from her chest. 
Her mouth overflowed with flames, as molten as lava. 
The soldiers, looking back at this terrifying sight, were paralyzed with fear, their bodies trembling uncontrollably. 
“No! No! Don’t come any closer!!” 
“Where is our god? Someone save us, I don’t want to die!” 
“Aaaah…” 
“Boom!” 
Suddenly, an overwhelming torrent of fire spewed from her mouth, stretching for miles! 
The sight was as breathtaking as it was terrifying! 
Yet beneath this splendor lay the screams of tens of thousands, their terror and despair as they perished in the flames! 
The power was overwhelming. 
But it wasn’t over. As the Flame Dragon Mother ascended, Scar, Thunder Calamity, and Sin swooped down for a second wave of attacks. 
Among the fleeing crowd, Corto’s forehead throbbed, his veins bulging as he strained to give commands, only to hear a sudden ringing in his ears! 
It felt as though his hearing had gone, yet he could still clearly hear his own rapid breathing. 
Looking around, everything seemed to slow down. 
The despair and fear on every face were visible in stunning detail. 
Some people stumbled, piling on top of each other, losing their balance. 
Others trembled uncontrollably, cowering on the ground in prayer. 
There were those dragging their severed legs, ignoring the blood and pain as they desperately tried to flee, clinging to the hope of survival. 
Corto paused, “Am I… am I going to die?” 
He looked back, against the flow of the crowd, at the dragons descending with murderous intent. Slowly, he closed his eyes. 
There was no hope, no miracle. 
Engulfed in a storm of lightning and fire, he, like the other soldiers, was reduced to ashes. 
And thus… 
The War Empire was declared defeated. The complete eradication of its remaining soldiers was now only a matter of time. 
Lin Tian stood on the crumbling bell tower, gazing over the vast ruins. 
In the City of Twilight, there was no sunset today, but the old brilliance remained. 
The dragon’s flames swept across every inch of land. 
Until all was reduced to ashes. 
Even the fleeing nobles couldn’t escape the dwarves’ wrath and were all slaughtered by steel war machines outside the western district. 
“Hahaha, the Goblin Empire can now declare its establishment to the entire continent, bringing absolute shock with its absolute power!” 
Bill sat atop the war machine, grinning with satisfaction. 
They say when a whale falls, life flourishes. 
The dwarves, too, could return to the surface by relying on the goblins, and the dragons no longer needed to hide in tree hollows. 
Lin Tian felt a deep sense of emotion; this victory carried immense significance, even though it was built upon death and blood. 
But it was the only way to declare their presence to the world! 
The goblins—vicious goblins—were no longer low-level monsters. They could now stand on equal footing with the leaders of any empire! 
Soon after, they began clearing the battlefield. 
Although the eastern and southern districts of the city had been reduced to ruins by the dragons’ destructive power, the central, north, and western districts remained intact. 
There were many supplies here, which could greatly enhance the overall strength of the Goblin Empire. 
The group arrived in the central area to rest and recover. 
The goblin army and the dragons would rest in the ruined sections, keeping them from causing further damage. This city was a treasure and could serve as a critical stronghold against attacks from other empires. 
The Goblin Empire was located on the continent’s edge, with the Great Tomb behind it and the Abyss of Nothingness beyond that. 
To the outside, they faced the destroyed Sword Kingdom and the Magic Kingdom. 
Further out lay the War Empire. 
So, any empire that wanted to invade would first have to pass through here. 
In the future, they could develop this place into a secondary capital. 
Upon entering the magnificent palace, everyone sat down to rest, eat, and think about the tasks ahead. 
These wouldn’t be as simple as the battle had been. 
They needed to consider the dwarves, dragons, the Dragon Slayer Guild, and the distribution of this city. 
The One-Eyed Owl, exhausted and drenched in fragrant sweat, wandered around the center of the palace. 
Bill couldn’t help but gulp as he watched, his eyes shining with desire. He focused intently on a drop of sweat that trickled down her finely sculpted abs, disappearing into the crevice of her muscles. 
“Hey, old dwarf, I’m kindly reminding you—control your eyes and your mouth, or you’re going to suffer.”  
At that moment, Grugia walked past him and spoke. 
Though his tone was harsh, his irritation stemmed from concern for their boss, the One-Eyed Owl. He didn’t want Bill to end up getting pounded to the point where he couldn’t handle it. 
The One-Eyed Owl, still full of energy, then shouted, “Kid, with Alexander not here, I’m not satisfied yet! How about you and I have a close combat match? I’ll make you fall in love with the feeling of skin-to-skin contact, that tight, intimate touch!” 
“Tell me, how can I not look? With what she just said, how am I supposed to keep my thoughts straight?” Bill couldn’t help but blurt out. 
Lin Tian, deep in thought, chuckled. “Master Bill, you saw how she looked just now. If that’s where your mind went, could it be that you’ve been starved for too long? Should I call some young, beautiful girls over to ease your mind?” 
Since ancient times, soldiers had always craved one thing after a victory. 
Once inside the city, they would take whatever they wanted, indulge in whoever they pleased. 
There was no shortage of women. 
“Forget it, you should focus on what to do next. Don’t worry about these old bones of mine,” Bill replied gruffly. He did want it, but at this point, it was just a thought. 
At the palace’s meeting table, the Flame Dragon Mother had already taken on a humanoid form, dressed in a fiery, seductive gown, sitting in one corner with an air of elegance. 
She didn’t speak, merely observing the group in silence. 
Adele, too, wore a solemn expression, contemplating whether the dwarves should move their nation to the surface or live in the goblin capital under Lin Tian’s protection. 
The members of the Dragon Slayer Guild, including Osius, also turned their gaze toward the One-Eyed Owl. 
She felt embarrassed, unsure of what decision to make. 
At that moment, Alice, who had been commanding the three armies, flew to the palace entrance and spoke gravely, “Messenger, we have an emergency.” 
Hearing this, everyone’s expressions changed slightly. 
“It seems the king of the War Empire has returned, and he has many extremely powerful companions with him. Their threat level is far greater than that of the millions of troops we just defeated,” Alice continued. 
At this, no one could remain seated. 
They all hurried to investigate. 
Outside the eastern city walls, a massive teleportation magic circle still shimmered on the ground, its colors dazzling. 
Alexander, piloting the magic device ‘Roaring Chariot,’ circled in the air, shouting, “Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! Why are there so many goblins, so many dragons, and even… dwarves?!” 
Back outside the city, Joan of Arc, mounted on a white warhorse, inquired, “Your Majesty Alexander, what’s the situation inside? Is it severe?” 
“Your Majesty Joan! The War Empire… has fallen!” Alexander replied, his face twisted with bitterness and despair. 
The dozen or so people around him let out sighs of disbelief. 
Joan’s expression shifted, filled with deep concern and anger. “Do not fear, with us here, we will reclaim your empire for you.” 
With that, the group moved to the city walls. 
When they saw the endless ruins filled with monsters and the dragons soaring in the sky, they were all shocked and speechless! 
Even Joan of Arc found it hard to believe. 
At that moment, Lin Tian and his companions arrived quickly, and when he saw who they were, his expression also changed. 
Instinct! 
Instinct alone told him that this group of people was definitely not to be trifled with, but he wouldn’t back down either. 
From a distance, Joan of Arc locked eyes with Lin Tian, who stood among the dragons, dwarves, and monsters. 
Their gazes met. 
One pair of eyes was blood-red and sinister, while the other was clear and bright, filled with righteousness and anger. 
Sparks flew between them! 
“It’s him!” 
With just one glance, Joan recognized Lin Tian, her expression turning complex. 
Back then, she had even considered Lin Tian’s actions as reasonable, defending him with her words. But she hadn’t expected such a grave mistake to result from it. 
Now, she couldn’t possibly turn a blind eye to the War Empire’s downfall!
