Chapter 10: Journey to Human Territory! 
TL: Sungmin 
Time passed quickly, and the number of life simulations refreshed again. 
Lin Tian found a good place and started simulating. 
[Life Simulation System is starting, current scenario: Capturing Elves 
After considerable effort, you finally conquered the northern elf tribe and impregnated all the captured female elves. 
Seeing that the tribe members would soon expand, you planned to seek revenge on the stubbly man. 
The pregnant elves successfully gave birth to goblins, whose attributes were much stronger than ordinary goblins. 
Through manipulating Lia, she taught you the elves’ stealth techniques. 
So, while the small goblins grew up, you sneaked into a nearby human town, searching for the whereabouts of the Blades of Valor, and finally found them in Bright Town. 
Option 1: Take action yourself and try to kill Loder and others, rating 50! 
Option 2: Go back and lead the goblins to avenge, while also slaughtering Bright Town, rating 30. 
Option 3: Watch and wait, thinking it’s not the right time yet, observe for a while, rating 10.] 
Lin Tian’s expression tightened. He found those damned guys? 
Choosing the first option carried great risk. Although his overall attributes had already reached 600, he was still in human territory. If attacked by a group, he would definitely die. 
The second option was also good and had always been his plan. 
However, based on past experience, choosing this would definitely lead to death. 
This time, he chose option 3, to endure and observe. 
[You became cautious, which is a good habit, so you stayed in Bright Town, learning that a dragon often attacked the town, and Loder had even invited the Sword Saintess to slay the dragon. 
When you tried to leave, you were discovered by the Sword Saintess and died miserably under her powerful sword. 
Summary: Facing the powerful Sword Saintess, there was no chance to escape at all, be sure to be careful! 
Rating: 30 points (out of 100) 
Reward: Life Points x30 
This life simulation is over, time progressed 9 days.] 
“Swish!” 
Lin Tian snapped out of the system, his expression serious. 
Damn it, he died again. Was it that easy? 
Unexpectedly, it was the Sword Saintess again. 
He had to find a chance to deal with her! 
He wondered how much of an improvement she would bring him. 
Next, it was time for the elves to give birth. Lin Tian and Gobu Yue helped with the delivery, fearing anyone would have a difficult birth. 
These elves were extremely precious breeding machines; no one could die. 
“Wah! Wah!” 
As the cries of babies echoed, Lin Tian gradually relaxed. 
However, there were still voices of disgust from the elves, “No! Not this kind of child! So disgusting!” 
“Why did I give birth to such a horrible thing, sob sob sob!” 
“Oh my God, is this my child? Help!” 
Goblin babies were only the size of a fist, sticky all over, able to run around immediately after birth. 
They didn’t need milk, obtaining nutrition by eating flesh right after being born. 
This was why these creatures were hard to eradicate. 
Their vitality was too strong! 
The key was that one birth usually produced three or four. 
After all, female goblins highly cooperated during mating, usually producing multiple eggs. 
“Kashana, hang in there! Push!” 
At this time, the anxious voice of the Elf Matriarch Lia rang out. 
In the cage, the jade-like Kashana was sweating profusely, lying and sitting in pain, unable to give birth. 
Lin Tian frowned and quickly went to check. 
Seeing him, Kashana strongly resisted, “Get away! Don’t look at me, don’t look at me!” 
She was very angry, very ashamed, and with the pain below, she began crying loudly. 
Already lacking physical strength, crying exhausted her faster, risking death from weakness. 
Lia, also exhausted from just giving birth, couldn’t help at all. 
She pleaded, “Please save this child! She’s not going to make it!” 
“I know!” 
Lin Tian, having learned about this before, directly helped correct the position. 
In a short while, a goblin infant covered in mucus was born. 
Then another. 
Eventually, six in total were born! Sextuplets! 
This time, she gave birth to the most! 
Lin Tian was a bit surprised, no wonder she had a difficult birth. 
“You, you bastard…” 
Kashana weakly said, her voice small but her stubbornness strong. 
Lia couldn’t help but shed tears, glad that Kashana was safe. 
“Jie jie jie, we can use them again!” 
“Let me go first!” 
At this moment, a group of goblins, unable to bear the heat in their bodies, started crawling towards the exhausted elves. 
Despite the resistance and screams, they had no intention of stopping. 
Lin Tian’s eyes turned cold. He took out his short sword and walked over, “Swish!” 
Blood splattered, and he split the leading three goblins in half on the spot, feeding them to the newborn goblin infants. 
“I said they need to rest for three days before breeding. Have you all forgotten?” 
Facing the murderous Lin Tian, the goblins trembled in fear and backed away. 
Then Lin Tian said, “Go prepare the best fruits, each elf gets double the usual amount!” 
“Yes, boss.” 
A group of goblins ran off in terror, afraid of being slaughtered. 
“You, you really are different from ordinary goblins…” 
Seeing Lin Tian at this moment, Lia’s expression changed slightly, as did the expressions of the other elves who had just given birth. 
Lin Tian said calmly, “This is how it should be. As long as you behave, your treatment will be better.” 
Lia lowered her head and said nothing more. 
She looked at the small goblins she had given birth to, who were now lying beside her eating, and she didn’t know what to think. 
“Gobu Yue, I plan to visit the human territory in the next few days. The tribe will be under your management.” 
Lin Tian gazed into the distance as he spoke. 
A flash of murderous intent flickered in his eyes. 
He intended to find the whereabouts of Loder and the white-robed nun. 
Gobu Yue looked a bit worried but nodded anyway. 
At this moment, Lia’s voice rang out, “You’re going to human territory? Are you crazy? Goblins get killed just for approaching.” 
“What choice do I have? I can only take the risk.” 
Lin Tian shrugged. 
After a long pause, the hesitant Lia finally said, “Come over here, I’ll cast the stealth skill on you so you won’t be easily detected by humans.” 
This was exactly what Lin Tian had been waiting for. 
He teased, “I didn’t expect you to care about my safety. How rare.” 
“Not at all! I just… I just fear that if you die, the other goblins will be more brutal.” 
Lia blushed slightly and then helped Lin Tian complete the stealth buff. 
After a simple disguise, he covered his body with a stealth cloak that made him look like an ordinary passerby about one and a half meters tall. 
It looked quite strange, but with the stealth buff, most people wouldn’t notice him. 
Lin Tian felt assured with this outfit. 
He then set off, leaving the enchanted forest.
