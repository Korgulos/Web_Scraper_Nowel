Chapter 93: Danger, the Severely Injured Cannibal Eagle 
TL: Sungmin  
When Gobu Tian took the dagger, he felt the terrifying power within it and trembled! 
“Th-thank you, Boss!” 
Immediately after, Lin Tian took out four more eleventh-tier magic weapons: a sword, shield, axe, and halberd. 
They were all exquisitely made and forged from rare ores. 
Most importantly, these weapons could release and enhance magical attacks. 
Lin Tian said, “Gobu Kuang, these weapons are for you. They serve as magical mediums, releasing different magical attacks.” 
“I’m so touched, Boss! By the way, I also captured a few beautiful female adventurers over there, kept them for you!” 
Gobu Kuang suddenly remembered and mentioned. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian felt very gratified, “It’s good that you have this thought, but I’m not interested right now.” 
He had almost met his end in the Dwarf Kingdom, because of its women. 
He hadn’t had any such desires for some time now. 
But since Gobu Kuang was so considerate, he decided to give him a world-class magic weapon later. 
“What about me, Boss!” At this moment, Gobu Shan said expectantly. 
Lin Tian gave him a stern look, “You have an unhealthy mindset. Remember to correct it. Here.” 
With that, he took out a long spear and a sturdy shield, both gleaming with brilliance. 
“Another world-class weapon!!” 
Nearby, Alice and Goblin Slayer, who had been in contact with the human world, were utterly shocked! 
Lin Tian explained, “This is called Athena’s Spear and Shield, top-tier equipment in both attack and defense. Remember to disguise it well, don’t show off too much.” 
They were indeed too extravagant. 
They would easily attract attention. 
Gobu Shan was trembling with excitement. Even though he didn’t fully understand, he knew how precious and powerful these weapons were. He was overwhelmed with gratitude, “Boss, I’d die for you without hesitation!” 
“Hmph, just empty words.” Lin Tian said proudly. 
In his heart, he was still fond of these few. They had been loyal and had followed him since they were young. 
As their wisdom grew, their rebellious nature gradually diminished. Even if Lin Tian couldn’t defeat them, they wouldn’t vie for the boss’s position. 
Finally, Alicenia couldn’t help but ask, “Messenger, where did you get so many high-tier magic weapons? Just these few pieces surpass the entire stock of the Lionheart Empire and the Church!” 
The Lionheart Empire had no world-class weapons, and the Church only had one. 
How could they not be astonished? 
“Thanks to the guidance of God, I found the dwarves, who forged these magic weapons for me.” Lin Tian said solemnly. 
This explanation was the only one that could make them believe. 
“God, dwarves?! Oh my, so the dwarves weren’t extinct? They’ve been searched for across the continent for decades without success, and yet…” 
Alice was excited and amazed, more convinced than ever that Lin Tian was a divine messenger. 
Seeing her, Lin Tian remembered, “Oh right, take this weapon.” 
He then took out a few world-class magic weapons he had discovered early on in the magic weapon vault. 
The Ominous Blade and the Eye of the Darkspawn. 
With Jamila’s help, these two world-class magic weapons had been fused together. 
Not only could they unleash the power of the demon dragon, but if the souls within the Eye of the Darkspawn could be controlled and conquered. 
One could even gain the ability to transform into a Darkspawn. 
Transforming into one of the most brutal, powerful ancient races. 
A race born from bloodlust, war, and death. 
Lin Tian wasn’t confident he could do it, but he believed Alice could, so he directly handed the fused weapon to her. 
“Wh-what is this?! Such a strange and terrifying aura!” 
Even Alice felt a sense of dread at first sight of the fused weapon. 
After all, the demon dragon was the most savage dragon of ancient times, killed only through a joint effort by the continent. 
The Darkspawn were even more terrifying. 
After the establishment of the war rules system by various countries, wars were controlled, and the Darkspawn gradually went extinct. 
Each one of them had power far surpassing Alice. 
It was normal to feel dread. 
The black bone blade seemed alive, and the Eye of the Darkspawn at the junction of the hilt and blade stared fixedly at Alice. 
An ominous aura filled the entire valley. 
Everyone around felt a chill down their spines. 
Lin Tian couldn’t care less; Alice needed a handy weapon to bring out her true power, “Go, pick it up. This is a weapon bestowed upon you by God. Conquer it!” 
“But, shouldn’t God give me a holy weapon?” Alice asked, full of doubt. 
She had already raised Lin Tian and their child for several months without being tainted by the Blood of Ruin, and her holy power had long been restored. 
But she firmly stood by Lin Tian’s side. 
Until she redeemed the Church and the Empire, those devils. 
Lin Tian was slightly stunned but explained, “This weapon contains powerful magical creatures. You should conquer them to prevent them from falling into the wrong hands and harming the world. Isn’t this a sacred mission?” 
Upon hearing this, Alice seemed to understand something. 
Her cold gaze became more determined. 
Alice reached out and picked up the Ominous Blade. 
In an instant! 
It felt as though her head would explode, with two strange and terrifying forces surging into it! 
In a daze, she saw an enormous demonic dragon, over a thousand meters long, roaring. 
There was also a blood-soaked monster, several meters tall, fiercely fighting in the midst of a war-torn crowd. 
The scene was blood-red and creepy, the stench of death was almost palpable. 
“Yes, just like that, pick me up, go kill, incite wars, plant seeds of hatred! I will grant you unmatched power!” 
A sinister, raspy, and evil voice echoed in Alice’s mind! 
It came from the Darkspawn. 
She saw that the hand holding the Ominous Blade was being eroded, covered in spider-web-like crimson cracks. 
They were deepening. 
Alice’s eyes started to turn red, as if she was becoming a true Darkspawn. 
“Oh my god, what is this thing? I’ve never felt anything like this, it’s terrifying!!” 
Gobu Kuang and the others couldn’t help but tremble! 
Their eyes were filled with fear and anxiety. 
Every creature, whether monster or human, in the Tian Kuang Tribe, was affected. 
Regardless of the race, the terrifying memories of the ancient times dominated by the Darkspawn seemed to awaken within their souls! 
Suddenly! 
The voice of the Darkspawn quivered, as if sensing fear, “You!” 
“Swish!” 
Alice’s entire body was enveloped in intense holy light, and she regained her noble and sacred appearance. 
But her soul had already been reborn. 
“Hmph, you think you can deceive me? God is with me!!!” 
Alice let out a soft shout, forcibly suppressing the power of the Darkspawn. 
The demonic dragon also settled down, no longer restless. 
Alice’s beautiful, snow-white chest heaved with heavy breaths, “Indeed, God has helped me. This was the right choice, Messenger, I will see it through to the end!” 
“God is with you,” Lin Tian replied. 
He no longer feared Alice’s betrayal. Having already slaughtered so many, even if she realized the truth, she wouldn’t dare admit it. 
She could only walk this path to the end. 
He then gave her a tenth-tier defensive armor that matched her current aura. 
It was pitch-black and imposing. 
Next, he gave Gobu Yue a world-class accessory, ‘Tear of Cupid.’ 
If the wearer suffered a fatal injury, they would be protected in an indestructible tear-shaped crystal. 
No one could break it, only the power of love could. 
Goblin Slayer also received a world-class accessory, the ‘Divine Bracelet.’ 
It was somewhat like a Poké Ball. 
It could store loyal subordinates within the divine spaces of the bracelet, releasing them to fight at any time. 
And it could enhance them. 
It could store up to six divine spaces at a time. 
“When the time comes, go capture some Goblin Overlords to strengthen them to the level of Goblin Kings…” Lin Tian smiled and said. 
Goblin Slayer, holding the world-class magic item, felt as if she were in a dream, “But what if I most want to capture you?” 
“Uh, don’t joke around.” 
The remaining items were for the elves. 
Cassandra remained unchanged, like a proud little goblin, her arrogance written on her face. 
Even though everyone else was amazed, she acted indifferent. 
Lia, on the other hand, was still mature and alluring. 
Over time, as she helped Lin Tian with various tasks, she had become somewhat reliable. 
“I never thought that the leader of a small goblin tribe of a hundred could grow to this extent,” Lia sighed, grateful for her choice. 
Although Lin Tian had slaughtered her kin, as the tribe matriarch, she had to endure, ensuring the survival of the rest. 
Perhaps she didn’t have grand ambitions, but she was a good tribe matriarch. 
The elves, who initially misunderstood, were now grateful. 
Lin Tian took out a world-class longbow and said, “There should be no barriers between us now. I trust you. Take this; the elves are an important combat force for our Tian Kuang Tribe.” 
‘God-Hunting Longbow.’ 
When fully charged for three seconds, it would hit the target with 100% accuracy, unavoidable. 
This was the perverse nature of world-class magic items. Lin Tian still had dozens of them, like cabbages. 
Although the trip to the Dwarf Kingdom nearly killed him, it was worth it. 
Fortunately, he hadn’t used violence. Otherwise, he would have only obtained the three initial items from the magic vault. 
Lia, extremely moved, took the longbow, “Boss, I will always follow you.” 
She knelt on one knee as she spoke. 
Lin Tian looked down and saw something bigger than his head, swallowing his saliva, “Ahem, you can get up now.” 
He needed to abstain for a few months, couldn’t afford to break his resolve. 
Cassandra remained proud, “Hmph, trash. It’s just a bow, what’s so special about it.” 
“Child, you can’t be rude to the boss.” Lia scolded quickly. 
Lin Tian indicated it was fine, patting her little head, “You’ve grown taller. I have to stand on tiptoe to touch your head now. What weapon do you want?” 
“I don’t want anything, hmph.” Cassandra pouted and turned away. 
Lin Tian thought for a moment and took out a pair of earrings. Although they were eleventh-tier magic items, they were enough. 
He said, “Kaelin’s Earrings. In dwarf legends, Kaelin was the most beautiful demi-goddess, but she was killed by a god who envied her. Whoever wears these earrings will become the most beautiful woman in the world in others’ eyes.” 
It was essentially a charm effect. 
Cassandra’s heart was itching as she looked at the alluring earrings and snatched them away, “Hmph, I’ll forgive you today, trash.” 
Lin Tian smiled relievedly; he’d deal with this little one when fully recovered. 
He had given out almost everything. 
The remaining magic items would be bestowed upon the elite army once established. 
Giving them out now would be wasteful. 
“By the way, Boss, the Cannibal Eagle Lord came by a while ago, looking very wretched, with one of its wings broken. It seemed to be looking for you but left since you weren’t here.” Gobu Yue remembered and said. 
Goblin Slayer added, “We wanted to ask what happened, but it didn’t say anything.” 
“The Cannibal Eagle? I’ll go check. You all should hide these magic items well, don’t make them too conspicuous.” 
After giving instructions, Lin Tian rode away on Xiao Huan. 
The Cannibal Eagle was one of his closest allies in this great tomb. 
Despite having no blood relation, it treated him sincerely. 
A rare friend indeed, and he couldn’t stand by when it was in trouble.
