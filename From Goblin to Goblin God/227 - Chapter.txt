Chapter 227: Battle Begins, The Army Arrives! 
TL: Sungmin  
Crystalline, gem-like energy essences were being transported by the worker insects. 
Lin Tian, of course, had to consume them all. If he didn’t, he truly might die of exhaustion. 
Moreover, these things could enhance his attributes. 
After consuming them for half a year, his combat power increased by a few hundred. It was better than nothing. 
“Good, just like that. Eat them all so you can regain your strength! I couldn’t bear to lose such a good servant like you. Where else would I find one?”  
The true form of the Zerg Queen chuckled softly, her eyes full of anticipation. 
Even after playing with Lin Tian for six whole months, every time they started, she was always filled with excitement. 
Lin Tian, however, couldn’t take it anymore. 
During this time, he had used Abnormal Fusion so many times to replace his kidneys that if he hadn’t, he would have long since died. 
But he couldn’t leave, and the only kidneys available were from the Zerg. 
Basically, under such violent usage, he needed to replace them every three days. 
If it had been kidneys from the carnivorous horse, he would already be dead, with grass growing over his grave more than three meters high. 
But today, even though he had just killed a worker insect to replace his kidneys, he still felt an overwhelming chill. 
His thin limbs trembled in the wind. 
He felt as if they might snap at any moment. 
Lin Tian tried his best to activate his most vital tool, but he realized it lay still, like an old man at death’s door. 
“Damn!” 
Lin Tian’s heart trembled, a bad premonition rushing to his mind. 
This was no small matter! 
He tried for a long time but still couldn’t get the engine started. 
The sky had collapsed. 
Lin Tian’s expression started to fill with panic. 
In the end, he had no choice but to accept this outcome. 
But as a man, he could die in battle, endure any hardship, but he couldn’t admit that he couldn’t perform! 
“What are you stalling for?” The Zerg Queen’s impatient voice rang out. 
“Phew…” Lin Tian let out a heavy breath. 
With the most difficult tone, he admitted his defeat, “Queen, I can’t do it anymore. Please spare me…” 
At this moment, for every man, it was as though he had already died! 
Killed alive! 
“What!” 
The Zerg Queen couldn’t believe it, “My dear, don’t joke with me. I’ve been waiting for so long, and now you say you can’t do it!!! Can you bear the consequences of that?” 
“Whatever. Kill me if you want…” 
Lin Tian closed his eyes, collapsing on the ground like a dead man. 
This was not just exhaustion; it was worse than when he had been ambushed by hundreds in the Dwarf Kingdom. That was a temporary injury. 
In his current state, it would be better to just die. 
After all, Lin Tian still had one life left for resurrection. Perhaps by then, he might recover. 
Seeing this, the Zerg Queen also noticed Lin Tian’s helplessness. “It’s alright, I can help you solve this.” 
She swallowed a few energy essences. 
Her massive insect body began to writhe and swell! 
She laid a black insect egg. 
The egg immediately hatched, revealing a creature that looked somewhat like a mosquito with a long, sharp proboscis! 
Its limbs and body resembled a rat from the sewers, making it very strange. 
Covered in sticky, slimy mucus. 
It was disgusting to look at. 
“This is a worker insect I specially produced for you. Its role is simple—it can stimulate males and help them recover their abilities! But it may not be permanent.” The Zerg Queen spoke calmly. 
Clearly, this thing was a highly dangerous stimulant with severe side effects. 
But for her own pleasure, she didn’t care if it killed Lin Tian—her goal was to play him to death anyway. 
As the strange insect rushed at him, Lin Tian used all his strength to dodge! 
He barely avoided being pierced by that proboscis. 
And the thing was huge! Over a meter long, aiming directly at his most vulnerable area. 
The pain would be unbearable! 
And the side effects of such a thing would only make matters worse. 
Lin Tian hurriedly refused, “Zerg Queen, let me rest for a day, I might recover by then! Don’t be so cruel!” 
“Shut up! You choose: accept the worker insect’s stimulant or die!” 
The Zerg Queen’s face twisted in anger. 
Lin Tian looked at that long proboscis. If he accepted, it meant he’d be stabbed every day. Just the thought of it made him wince in pain! 
He’d rather die! 
“I choose…” Lin Tian’s face darkened, his voice filled with gloom as he finally made his decision. “To kill you!” 
“Swish!” 
The Spear of Zeus appeared in his hand. 
“You bitch, you’re worse than a beast! Even the work mules in the fields get to rest. Would it kill you to let me rest a few days? Since you won’t, don’t blame me for what happens next!” 
Lin Tian rose in resistance. 
But then, the Zerg Queen’s enormous tentacle, like the sky falling, pinned Lin Tian down tightly! 
Luckily, there was a small gap, or he would have been crushed. 
But the pressure made him feel like he couldn’t breathe, his face contorting in pain. 
The Zerg Queen’s face surged with killing intent. “This is your own choice! If you’re no longer of any use, then die!” 
“Zerg Queen, a large enemy force is approaching the empire!” 
Suddenly, a scout worker insect swiftly emerged from beneath the floor, speaking urgently. 
The Zerg Queen paused for a moment, confused. “Enemy army? What army? Who dares challenge the Zerg Empire?” 
“From what I observed, most of them are goblins, at least over a hundred million, and they’re accompanied by dwarves, dragons, and others.” 
The scout worker insect reported. 
Such a terrifying number of enemies would cause anyone to gasp in fear and despair. 
However, the Zerg Queen remained dismissive. “A hundred million troops and a few flying lizards dare to challenge me? Do they think my two hundred million Zerg are just for show? Darling, is this the real reason you came here? Fine! Today, I’ll make sure you lose all hope!” 
She glanced down. 
But there was nothing there! 
At the foot of the Zerg Queen’s palace, Lin Tian hid behind a large tree, breathing heavily, his expression twisted. “Damn btch! You sword-wielding demon! Don’t ever fall into my hands!” 
After enjoying himself for so long, this was the first time he had come so close to being killed! 
And this kind of situation was utterly humiliating! 
He had always been the one to torment others, yet now he had been forcibly turned into someone else’s plaything. 
His male pride—no matter what—had to be restored! 
“Goblin! You won’t escape my grasp!!! All the soldier insects, mobilize! Capture him and bring him back! I’ll play him to death!” 
The Zerg Queen’s furious voice roared through the heavens like thunder. 
Countless insects began to move in unison! 
Lin Tian frowned. It wasn’t easy to hide within the Zerg Queen’s territory. 
The Ant Queen’s domain might offer refuge, but there wasn’t enough time. 
Above him, countless flying beetle-like insects buzzed around, searching the area. 
A deafening “buzz buzz” filled the air, forming a massive web-like net! 
“Goblin King! I’ve come to save you!” 
Suddenly, from a nearby clump of grass, a giant green caterpillar spoke up. 
Lin Tian turned his head, startled. “It’s you? How did you grow so big!” 
Previously, the worm had only been about a meter long. 
Now, it was as large as a bus, massive and bloated! 
“You gave me so much gold. I spent it all on meat, and before I knew it, I grew this big!” The green caterpillar chuckled. 
Then, it turned serious. “Quickly, you need to hide inside my body. That way, no one can find you!” 
As it spoke, it opened its huge mouth. 
The stench and the slimy, mucus-filled maw were utterly revolting. 
The reddish, tender flesh of its mouth looked strangely grotesque. 
“What are you waiting for? You’re so weak right now, you won’t be able to escape! Come on, climb into my body!” 
The green caterpillar urged anxiously. 
Lin Tian felt a wave of nausea. “Hold on, stop saying weird things. If I go inside, you won’t digest me, right?” 
“I’ll coat you in a layer of cocoon silk. You won’t be digested.” The green caterpillar reassured him. 
Having reached this point, Lin Tian had no other choice. He had to endure the disgust and climb inside. “Take me out of the Zerg Empire. My army is out there!” 
“Got it!” 
Immediately, the green caterpillar swallowed him whole and began crawling swiftly. 
The entire Zerg Empire seemed to be in upheaval! 
Previously unseen insect species began appearing, such as the dark earthworms. 
These monsters wouldn’t die when cut by sharp blades. Instead, they’d split into two. 
If not killed instantly, one could multiply into a hundred, making them extremely terrifying. 
Other creatures emerged as well, like the Cockroachmen, Death Spiders, and Venomous Soldier Flies. 
Numerous nocturnal Zerg species, usually hidden, appeared in droves. 
They prepared for battle. 
The sheer number of insects was overwhelming, to the point where the green caterpillar could barely move forward, surrounded by the dense swarm! 
In addition, the cacophony of insect sounds filled the air, creating an unbearable racket! 
Back in the Zerg Queen’s palace, numerous soldier insects returned, reporting that they couldn’t find Lin Tian. 
“Useless scum! Die, all of you!” 
The Zerg Queen’s fury knew no bounds. With a mere thought, two Zerg Kings rushed forward and killed dozens of soldier insects! 
After all, she didn’t care about losing a few. 
Then, she issued a new command, “Prepare for battle! Cockroachmen, Death Spiders, Venomous Soldiers—you will be the vanguard! Take out their high-ranking forces!” 
“Rest assured, Queen. We will complete the mission!” 
The Cockroach bowed respectfully. 
Though ordinary cockroaches were weak and easily crushed, the magical Cockroach were muscular, standing over three meters tall! 
They were all-rounder warriors, with enough speed and strength, capable of flight, resistant to fire, water, electricity, and even pressure… 
Extremely difficult to kill. 
And, crucially, their numbers were staggering—three million of them, making them the equivalent of elite monsters. 
As a result, the Cockroach Chieftain held the highest status among the Zerg Queen’s trusted minions. 
And also had the most combat power. 
Then there were the Death Spiders. 
Their eight long legs were eerie and menacing, like eight deadly spears. 
Their web-spinning ability was highly useful, able to slow down enemies, ensnare them from a distance, or create defensive barriers with their webs. 
Each egg clutch could hatch thousands of offspring. 
They were not to be underestimated. 
The Venomous Insects were even more terrifying. They could fly and spray corrosive venom from above, dissolving any creature into nothing but bone fragments in an instant. 
Fortunately, their numbers weren’t large, with only a little over ten thousand. 
However, they possessed the power to annihilate hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of enemies, making them one of the Zerg Queen’s most trusted elites. 
“Go forth, along with my millions of soldier insects as the backbone. A hundred million goblins? They’re nothing but a feast…”  
The Zerg Queen spoke with full confidence. 
Yet, she remained cautious, keeping two Zerg Kings by her side at all times. 
They were there to protect her, ready for anything.
