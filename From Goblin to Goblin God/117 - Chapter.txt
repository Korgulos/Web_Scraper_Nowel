Chapter 117: Only Harm Can Come from Obsessing Over Everything 
TL: Sungmin 
“Yes…yes, Your Majesty.” The scout stammered, bewildered. 
He didn’t understand why their king had such a strong reaction. 
Even the fall of the Lionheart Empire hadn’t provoked such a response. 
Edward’s expression remained one of disbelief, “Are you sure you didn’t see it wrong? How could she join the monster’s side?!” 
He recalled visiting the Lionheart Empire a few years ago and meeting Alicenia. 
Unfortunately, she had to rush off on a mission, so they didn’t have much time to talk. 
But in that short encounter, she had left an impression on him—a king with a legacy of hundreds of years, known as the Sword Saint, who remained unmarried to this day. 
“It can’t be wrong, Your Majesty…” The scout repeated. 
Edward then dismissed him, “I need some time to calm down and think about the Lionheart Empire’s issue. You may leave.” 
“If that’s the case, we must unite with the Clover and Shamrock Kingdoms to swiftly liberate the Lionheart Empire.” After pondering for a long time, Edward muttered to himself. 
He immediately organized a banquet. 
He invited the kings and nobles of the two magic kingdoms. 
As for their church members, he didn’t bother with them at all. 
These kingdoms, free from monster invasions, naturally had weaker churches. 
Even their pope’s strength was only in the thousands. 
Not even a match for one hair of Douglas. 
After all, the pope was a position, not a measure of power. 
At the Holy Sword Plaza. 
Today, Edward set up a lavish banquet and had sent invitations to the kings of Clover and Shamrock Kingdoms. 
Knowing their fondness for beautiful women and fine wine. 
He specifically selected many long-legged blonde women, dressed in ultra-short gowns, each holding bottles of exquisite wine, ready to serve. 
The patrolling soldiers around couldn’t take their eyes off them. 
“My God, His Majesty sure knows how to pick them. These legs, I could never get tired of them!” 
“Jade legs, so many jade legs!” 
“Obsessing over everything jade will only harm you. Shh, those two guys seem to be coming.” 
The soldiers whispered among themselves. 
In the sky above the plaza, a dazzling magic circle appeared. 
“Swish!” 
Two beams of white light landed. 
Two groups of people appeared. 
They were none other than the kings of the Clover Magic Kingdom, ‘Gilbert,’ and the Shamrock Magic Kingdom, ‘Gilberts.’ 
The two were actually brothers. To divide their inheritance, they split the original Five-leaf Clover Kingdom into two. 
(Shamrocks are 3-leafed clovers.) 
Each took half. 
Though not particularly handsome, Gilbert was fat with a large head and ears. 
Gilberts was short and somewhat underdeveloped. 
However, their strength was not to be underestimated; both could wield world-class magic. 
Thus, Edward treated them with such grand hospitality, hoping to leverage their power against Lin Tian . 
He was not weak, nor foolish. 
A monster that could defeat the old pope was not to be trifled with. 
Each brother was accompanied by several mysterious masked men and a few beauties. 
Seeing Edward, they greeted in unison, “Long time no see, brother Sword Saint, hahaha!” 
“The same to you. Please, take your seats. The wine and women are ready for you.” Edward smiled accommodatingly. 
He didn’t mention business first but let them enjoy themselves. 
Gilbert’s eyes were glued to the long-legged women, “My God, only the women of the Sword Kingdom have such legs, such figures, straight like swords!” 
“Brother, you take half, I’ll take half, we’ll have our fill tonight!” Gilberts chuckled. 
However, the two began to quarrel. 
Gilbert coughed, “I am your elder brother; I deserve more.” 
“Can you even handle so many with that fat body of yours?” 
“And you? Look at yourself, malnourished, truly embarrassing!” 
In the midst of their argument. 
Edward sighed, “Enough, let me get to the point. As long as you join forces with me to reclaim the Lionheart Empire and recover the cities they took from me, I will give you ten more later.” 
The royal city of the Lionheart Empire used to belong to the Sword Kingdom. 
That was why he made this proposition. 
Gilbert and Gilberts immediately understood. 
“I was wondering why Edward was so agreeable today, turns out it’s this.” Gilbert said sarcastically. 
His hands, which had been stroking the beautiful legs, reluctantly withdrew. 
Clearly, he was not keen to agree. 
Edward furrowed his brow and said helplessly, “Rest assured, I only want to reclaim the Lion City. You can take the other cities.” 
Though valuable, the other cities combined couldn’t compare to the Lion City. 
So, he offered them. 
Gilberts showed some interest, “We understand the situation in the Lionheart Empire. Monsters are a threat to the entire continent. We do need to unite.” 
“Indeed, our human race stands at the top of the world’s food chain because we unite against external threats.” Gilbert echoed. 
Both wearing the guise of upright gentlemen. 
But the truth was, in their magical kingdom territories, there had once been powerful monsters and demi-human races. 
Only through joint suppression had they either been eradicated or forced into hiding. 
The Sword Kingdom had fought an internal battle with the Centaur tribe for over a hundred years. 
Eventually, it ended with the death of the Centaur Emperor. 
His daughter led the remaining Centaurs into hiding. 
Edward breathed a sigh of relief, “If you say so, then I am reassured.” 
However, neither of these brothers had any good intentions. 
After exchanging glances, Gilbert grinned mischievously and said, “There’s one more condition: let us have a look at your contracted spirit, or rather, your master, Lady Sylph’s peerless beauty. How about that?” 
One of the four great elemental spirits. 
Sylph of the Wind, one of the oldest beings on this continent. 
Edward’s strength was closely tied to her. 
The two brothers had long heard that Sylph was a female spirit and had coveted her for a long time. 
Upon hearing this. 
Edward’s face darkened, and he said grimly, “Don’t go too far. You’re worse than goblins…” 
Seeing his anger. 
The two brothers quickly pretended nothing had happened, “Oh, come on, we’re just joking. Don’t take it seriously!” 
After all, Edward was a king, and his strength was formidable. 
More importantly, while it seemed he was the only one in his kingdom capable of fighting, the Wind Spirit backing him was unfathomably powerful. 
“I despise goblins deeply. If you can help eradicate them, seeing me is no big deal.” 
Suddenly. 
An ethereal, divine voice echoed in the plaza. 
It seemed to penetrate deep into one’s soul. 
A gentle breeze swept in. 
Stirring a few fallen leaves. 
Immediately, the air currents gathered, forming something like a magical effect, green and dazzling. 
Finally, they coalesced into a humanoid figure. 
Underneath the green, silky hair was a pure and charming face. 
She was petite, wearing a thin white dress. 
The closer to her feet, the more transparent it became, though her small jade-like feet were still visible. 
She wasn’t wearing shoes and floated slightly above the ground. 
“This is the Wind Spirit? Oh my! She’s so beautiful!” 
“Damn, those jade-like feet… such cute jade-like feet, I can’t imagine how delicious they must be!” 
“Haha, I can imagine.” 
“Why don’t you listen? Obsessing over everything jade will only harm you.” 
The soldiers were all staring in awe. 
Having been royal guards for years, they had heard about Edward contracting the Wind Spirit. 
But it was their first time seeing the legendary Wind Spirit. 
Gilbert and Gilberts were even more stunned, their eyes wide and fixed, as if they had forgotten to breathe! 
Gilberts even trembled, “Indeed, humans can’t compare to spirits. So pure, so… so tempting to taste every bit of her! Ah!” 
The more he thought about it, the more excited he became, even crying out. 
Naturally, humans ate grains and aged, got sick, and died. 
Elemental spirits fed on the essence of nature, pure and clean to the extreme. 
The only beings comparable to them were elves. 
Elves ate a vegetarian diet, making them much cleaner. 
Thus, humans labeled elves as monsters to capture and nearly exterminate them. 
Edward listened to their lewd remarks, his face darkening with anger. 
But since Sylph herself had agreed to show herself, he couldn’t say much. 
He respectfully clasped his hands, “Lady Sylph.” 
“No problem. Since you two have seen me, it’s time to fulfill your promise, right?” Sylph said coldly. 
Gilbert nodded vigorously, “Of course, but Lady Sylph, since you despise goblins so much, if we kill the goblins occupying the Lionheart Empire, can you reward us with something?” 
“What do you want as a reward?” Sylph asked impatiently. 
Seeing their lecherous expressions, she was clearly disgusted. 
Gilberts quickly replied, “We know it’s impossible to have an intimate exchange with you, but if you could serve us wine, that would be enough, hehe…” 
“Enough!” 
Suddenly, Edward shouted angrily, glaring at them. 
The two brothers immediately fell silent, scared. 
Gilbert then acted as if nothing had happened, “Haha, just kidding. These ten beauties are enough for us, Your Majesty Edward. Let’s drink and discuss the campaign tomorrow.” 
Sylph dissipated into the wind. 
Edward’s anger subsided considerably, and he began to take his seat. 
However, the brothers exchanged a glance, a hint of murderous intent in their eyes. 
They had already reached a mutual understanding. 
Since he wouldn’t let them have her, they would seize an opportunity to take her by force! 
Using transmission magic, they communicated. 
“Brother, let’s ensure he never leaves the Lionheart Empire alive. What do you think?” 
“Just as I thought, little brother!” 
“Alright, during the monster campaign, we’ll join forces to ambush him and then seal Sylph. We’ll take turns enjoying her!” 
“Hehe, an elemental spirit… such a pure being, every part of her is a delight!” 
“Hahaha!”
