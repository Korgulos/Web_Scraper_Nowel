Chapter 31: A New Dragon Descendant 
TL: Sungmin 
“Are you out of your mind?” 
Lin Tian immediately cursed, feeling that this guy was truly an idiot. 
He continued, “Do you have any idea how strong that crazy woman is? If I see her, there’s no chance of coming back. She’s probably already gone mad, just like you.” 
“That’s great! Mua! Mua! I love you! I love you, you little goblin, hahaha!” 
Loder, excited, gave Lin Tian several deep kisses on the spot. 
He laughed so hard he couldn’t close his mouth. 
Lin Tian was speechless; this guy was completely insane. 
He decided to rest for a bit as the bump on his head hadn’t gone down yet. 
Besides, he had to check the situation in Bright Town the next day and report back to the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother. 
That night, the residents of Bright Town stayed up all night. 
… 
The next day. 
Lin Tian rode his flying dragon around Bright Town, cautiously observing the situation. 
If the Sword Saintess hadn’t gone mad and decided to attack the Tian Kuang Tribe, then it’d be GG. (Good Game) 
Fortunately, his guess was right. 
The mighty figure that had always stood on the clock tower was finally gone. 
Even when Lin Tian got very close, he didn’t find any trace of the Sword Saintess, just the ruins. 
And the busy residents were burying the dead and mourning. 
The cries echoed continuously, resembling hell. 
Lin Tian felt no emotional fluctuation; the law of the jungle prevailed. He was a goblin, they were humans. It was simply a matter of who killed whom. 
There was nothing unusual about it. 
He had no sympathy for humans, just as humans had none for goblins. 
In the human world, the rule was to kill goblins on sight and clear out any discovered tribes or nests! 
Bright Town was the first “goblin nest” Lin Tian had found. 
He would clear it out and take it over sooner or later. 
But it wasn’t the right time yet. He didn’t have the strength to resist human armies and strong warriors. 
“Fell ill? Or left? Most likely fell ill, otherwise, if she wanted to abandon Bright Town, she would have sought revenge first.” 
Lin Tian thought, falling ill didn’t necessarily mean sickness; it could be a mental breakdown resulting in a loss of fighting spirit. 
He then headed towards Dragon Island. 
He had to admit, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother had been a great help. Otherwise, if those Imperial Knight Regiments had arrived, the Tian Kuang Tribe would have been exterminated long ago. 
On his way, he captured many cattle and sheep as a token of gratitude. 
When he reached the skies above Dragon Island, he saw the dragons still busy flying around, searching for food. 
Lin Tian flew directly to the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s nest. 
Before he even arrived, he saw her open her giant dragon eyes, quietly waiting. 
“Your Highness, Dragon Mother, long time no see!” 
Lin Tian slowly jumped onto the cliff, smiling politely. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s eyes were different from before. This time, they were no longer filled with disdain and disgust. 
Instead, there was admiration. 
“Long time no see. I heard about what you did yesterday, little one. It was truly satisfying.” 
“Haha, it was nothing. I just came to tell you that we need to continue harassing Bright Town for a while, and now we can get even closer.” 
Lin Tian scratched his head, pretending to be very honest. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother stared at him as if pondering something, “What reward should I give you? Flying around every day is quite tiring.” 
“I have something for you, look.” 
Lin Tian quickly brought out the beef and mutton he had brought. 
However, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother seemed uninterested in that. Her cold dragon eyes unexpectedly showed a hint of flirtation. 
She extended her huge, red, tender dragon tongue and gave Lin Tian a deep kiss, enveloping him completely, covering him in saliva. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother tasted and savored for a moment, “You smell delicious. The reward I want is you, how about that?” 
“Me? You must be joking.” 
Lin Tian felt extremely embarrassed. Truly embarrassed! 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s size was over a hundred meters! 
Lin Tian’s size? Just over a meter tall goblin. 
It was impossible, not to mention the requirement for attribute enhancement. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother was very serious, “Of course I’m not joking. Didn’t you make that other dragon pregnant?” 
Lin Tian felt even more embarrassed, “Let me explain, that was purely an accident.” 
“I won’t get angry over such things, but if you refuse, I might really get angry.” 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother opened her huge mouth, each of her sharp fangs several times larger than Lin Tian! 
It was terrifying. 
Lin Tian quickly said, “That’s not what I meant. I’m just a goblin; how could I match a dragon, right?” 
“We ancient dragons have always revered the strong. I wanted to go back to the dragon clan this time to mate with a strong dragon and produce stronger offspring. But now that I have you, why should I go back, right?” 
The voice of the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother didn’t sound like she was joking. 
It was serious! 
Because she knew that goblins had no reproductive isolation and could produce offspring with any race. 
She also wanted to see what kind of offspring she could produce. 
Perhaps this would be the first hybrid of a dragon and a goblin in history, and it would surely be different. 
Since the opportunity was presented, it was a pity not to take it. 
Lin Tian had no reason to refuse, especially after devouring the Evil Goblin and acquiring some remarkable skills. 
He approached slowly, then suddenly stopped, dumbfounded, and couldn’t help but shout. 
“What’s wrong? Have you arrived?” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother turned her head and asked. 
Lin Tian raised his head and, after a long silence, said, “It feels like an alien is staring into my soul!” 
“Huh?” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother was confused. 
Lin Tian then used his climbing skill to scale up. 
And he began his work. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother shivered, “So itchy, it feels like a little bug is crawling on me… You! You!” 
Suddenly, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s face turned red, her heart started to race. 
Her eyes were filled with shock and disbelief! 
Was this really a goblin? 
“I give up!” 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother quickly pleaded, biting her lip and acting coquettishly like a giant child. 
Lin Tian then stopped using the Evil Goblin’s skill, “Is it enough? Then I’ll start now.” 
At this time, the remaining flying dragons on Dragon Island were attracted by the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s cries and came to see what was happening. 
They were all stunned by the scene and gathered to watch. 
The more they watched, the more interested they became. 
“Roar? Roar roar roar!” 
“Roar roar roar roar!” 
“Ya-hoo!” 
Hearing the other dragons discussing, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother was both ashamed and angry, “Shoo shoo shoo! What are you looking at? Go catch some meat for me!” 
With that, the other dragons dispersed. 
Several hours passed in a flash. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s enormous body lay limp on the cliff, not wanting to move at all. 
“What is your name? You are truly amazing! I, I am yours from now on.” 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother panted as she spoke, each word seemed to take a great effort. 
Lin Tian shook his head, “Good deeds should remain anonymous. I’m leaving now.” 
He thought it would be impossible to mate, but it turned out to be easier than expected. 
Mainly because he was just too good. 
And he had gained a lot of attribute points for free: 500 health, 100 attack, and 100 defense! 
This was truly free. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother angrily said, “What do you mean by ‘anonymous’? How will I tell my child who their father is?” 
“Um, just call me Lin Tian. That’s right, Lin Tian. I’m off.” 
Lin Tian rode his bipedal dragon and left Dragon Island. 
He had more important things to do. 
Watching him leave, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother showed a playful smile, “A goblin? This race doesn’t seem so bad. No, rather, he might lead the goblins to create a new world…” 
Returning to the Tian Kuang Tribe, the captured humans had been mostly settled. 
But Loder, that lunatic, was still mocking and ridiculing them. 
He didn’t even look at his own pathetic state. 
“It’s over, Lord Loder has gone mad. What should we do? Will the Sword Saintess come to save us?” A young woman curled up in fear. 
Loder laughed, “The Sword Saintess? That bitch? Waiting for her to save you is more useless than killing yourself! Hahaha!” 
“You! Lord Loder, how can you speak like this about your master? What happened to you?” 
“Yes, from the beginning, we noticed something was wrong. Why do you seem to hate us and the Sword Saintess so much?” 
“Everyone, stop talking. He is truly pitiful; he must have suffered inhuman torture.” 
The residents looked at him with pity, which only made Loder roar in anger, “I don’t need your pity! Pity yourselves instead!” 
“Swoosh!” 
The sound of wind in the air grew louder as Lin Tian rode his dragon back. 
After dismounting, he examined the captured residents. 
He then walked towards the cage holding Lia, “Now, you are free. Those who wish to stay can stay, those who don’t can leave.” 
“What?” 
For a moment, not only Lia but even the other goblins were dumbfounded. 
So many elves, just set free? 
“You…” 
Lia opened her red lips, wanting to say something. 
Lin Tian shrugged, “I said I would grant you freedom. You are no longer of use to me, so you can go.” 
She had been honest and had helped many times. 
Granting her freedom was no issue. 
Now that he had the ability to protect himself, he wasn’t afraid of them returning for revenge. 
The main thing was, Lin Tian was gambling. 
He wanted her to bring the elves to join the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
These goblins were indeed strong, but they lacked ranged attack power. Having a group of elves as ranged fighters would be perfect. 
As the cage opened, Cassandra pulled Lia out quickly. 
“Mother, let’s go, let’s go quickly!” 
Lia stepped out, feeling a bit out of place. 
Cassandra hurried to help other elves open their cages, her small hands fumbling nervously, taking ages to open one cage. 
Gobu Yue quickly went over to help. 
All the elves were released this time. 
The feeling of regaining freedom made them cry with joy. 
However, they didn’t rush to leave, as they had nowhere to go. 
After a long silence, Lia finally said, “Cassandra, and all of you, if you want to leave, go back to the Myriad Forms Forest and start over. I plan to stay.” 
Lin Tian’s eyes flickered slightly, not surprised, or rather, he had expected her to stay. 
This woman’s cunning and deep scheming had been evident from the beginning. 
She would definitely choose to stay to keep an eye on him. 
Otherwise, she feared he might turn against them, kill or recapture them. 
By staying as a hostage, she could significantly reduce that possibility. 
“Lin Tian, from our interactions, I can tell you are not an ordinary goblin. I am willing to follow you. May I stay in the tribe?” 
Lia approached Lin Tian, her figure as voluptuous as ever. 
She then knelt on one knee, lowering her head, hoping to be accepted. 
Lin Tian looked at her and nodded, “You are smart. Staying might be useful. If the other elves leave, I promise not to trouble them.”
