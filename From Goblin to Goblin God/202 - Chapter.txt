Chapter 202: Declare War? Let Me Give You a Grand Gift First! 
TL: Sungmin  
An army of millions surged toward Twilight City like a waterfall from the nine heavens! 
The standard-bearer raised the flag of the “Freedom” Empire high! 
Earthquake siege engines were brought to the city walls, emitting high-frequency vibrations. In an instant, the hundred-meter walls crumbled into ruins! 
Many goblin soldiers were buried alive before they even realized what was happening. 
“Quick, report to the boss in the main city!” 
“Damn it! There’s a huge enemy force at the magic array too!” 
“Crap, fight them with everything you’ve got!” 
The goblins had no way out now. One by one, they grabbed their weapons and began to fight back. 
In the sky above, numerous soldiers from the Freedom Empire descended holding giant dandelion seeds, destroying the magic array as they landed. 
Moreover, these soldiers were all mages, slowly descending while clutching the dandelion seeds. If there was wind, they could stay in the air even longer. 
They continuously cast magic, killing large numbers of goblins with overwhelming force. 
The goblins of Twilight City were completely slaughtered. 
A total of 1.7 million, including those who hadn’t even grown up, were all killed. 
Joan stood atop the palace, calmly kicking over the flag marked with a goblin head, and planted the flag of the Freedom Empire. 
She looked down at the humans who had just been liberated. “You are free! There will be no more oppression. I will lead you to victory, to happiness!” 
“Long live Lady Joan!”  
The residents cheered, kneeling in worship. 
Seeing this, Joan smiled with satisfaction. “Alright, no need to kneel. This is simply my duty. I will not tolerate seeing my people oppressed by monsters! If there are any, I will fight them to the death!” 
Upon hearing these words, the residents, including the Freedom soldiers, all raised their arms and shouted Joan’s name! 
Seeing how much they adored her, Joan couldn’t suppress the smile on her lips. 
The sunlight bathed her face. 
She felt utterly content. 
“Little girl, don’t be afraid anymore. You’re free now. I’ve liberated you from the monsters’ rule,” Joan said, noticing a dirty little girl not far away. She walked over slowly, wiping the tears from the girl’s face. 
The little girl, moved by the gesture, said, “Big sister, thank you! But I’m so hungry… I really, really want something to eat…” 
Joan gave her a sweet smile. “Hungry? General Brian, do you have any food on you?” 
“Food? I still have some bread,” said a middle-aged man in bronze armor. 
He pulled out a piece of bread. 
Watching the little girl wolf down the bread, Joan felt even more gratified. “This is what I want to see, what I want to do. Little stick girl, from now on, stay with big sister. I won’t let you suffer anymore.” 
“Mhm, mhm! Big sister is so kind!” The little girl said excitedly. 
General Brian chuckled. “If Lady Joan ever wanted to become king, you’d be the greatest king in history! You are the people’s faith, their god!” 
“I don’t want to be any so-called god, nor do I want to be king. It’s enough for everyone to live better lives,” Joan said indifferently, holding the little girl’s hand and preparing to liberate more humans. 
Behind her, the crowd erupted into applause and cheers! 
“Lady Joan, you are our god!” 
“When I prayed countless times, the gods did not appear, but Lady Joan did!” 
“I will follow you until death!” 
… 
Goblin King City. 
A goblin used the barely functioning small teleportation array to return to the city. 
Immediately, it went to find Lin Tian. 
But seeing the palace reduced to rubble, it was dumbstruck. “No way… Even the main city was… by humans…” 
“What are you doing?”  
Suddenly, a voice came from behind, questioning him. It was Gobu Kuang. 
The goblin hurriedly replied, “Lord Gobu Kuang?! I’m one of the goblins stationed at Twilight City. It was invaded by Joan, and Twilight City has fallen!” 
Upon hearing this, Gobu Kuang immediately rushed to the district to find Lin Tian. 
At this moment, Lin Tian was still entangled with Sara. 
When Sara had finally dropped her pretense and given in completely, she was like a ravenous wolf. 
She relentlessly attacked Lin Tian, and he had to admit, the so-called Trojan bloodline was truly resilient. 
It was the first time he had encountered a woman who took all his strength to handle. 
“Boss! Boss! Something’s happened!”  
Outside, Gobu Kuang’s voice sounded. 
Lin Tian was resting, drenched in sweat. Beside him, the exquisite and radiant Sara slept sweetly, covered by a thin, translucent blanket. 
One could vaguely see her rare, flawless curves. 
Now, she was utterly devoted to Lin Tian. 
She had even given him the golden divine ornaments she wore. 
Wearing it not only protected him from the suppression of heroic powers but also made him immune to attacks from any of her Trojan summons. 
He didn’t even need his “Lucky Steal” skill to take it from her. 
She had given it to him willingly and without hesitation. 
Afterward, Lin Tian opened the door. 
Gobu Kuang immediately rushed in and explained the situation in full detail, his face full of rage. “Boss, we put so much effort into that place, and Joan is utterly shameless! She had promised not to interfere with us anymore, but then she turned around and launched a sneak attack on Twilight City!” 
“That damned bitch! Were the teleportation arrays destroyed?” Lin Tian’s expression turned dark. 
Gobu Kuang paused for a moment, then replied, “It seems like there’s still a small one that works.” 
“Let’s go. I want to see what’s going on with her!” Lin Tian said, hastily. 
He was curious to hear how she would try to justify herself, what excuse she’d come up with for attacking him. 
Suddenly, Sara reached out and said, “Your Majesty, let me come as well. If we run into Joan, I can hold her off for a while.” 
“No problem,” Lin Tian replied, slightly surprised. He had nearly forgotten to invite her, and yet she was so proactive. 
They arrived at the palace’s high platform, where the small teleportation array was located. 
This was a specially constructed small teleportation point. The larger teleportation arrays had already been moved to the surrounding goblin soldier cities. 
In the distance, others were busy rebuilding the palace, and with the help of the dwarves, there was no need to worry about anything. 
Lin Tian decided not to call them over. “Gobu Kuang, you stay behind. It’ll just be me and Sara.” 
“Boss, be careful,” Gobu Kuang said softly. 
Then, he carefully activated the teleportation array. 
The next moment, they arrived at Twilight City. 
From afar, they could hear Joan passionately delivering a speech, holding the little girl’s hand. 
“From today onwards, as long as I live, I will never allow you to be oppressed by monsters again! The same goes for humanity! You will all be citizens of the Freedom Empire!” Joan declared fervently. 
Below her, the hundreds of thousands of liberated residents of Twilight City were moved to tears. 
The square was filled with a sea of people! 
It was a spectacular sight. 
Suddenly, a voice interrupted, “Your Majesty Joan, don’t you think this is going a bit too far?” 
The entire scene fell silent. 
Hundreds of thousands of eyes turned simultaneously to look in the direction of the voice. 
When they realized it was a goblin, their faces instantly filled with anger and hatred! 
“It’s a goblin! Your Majesty Joan, quick, kill him!” 
“Damn goblin! How dare you show your face here!” 
“Kill him!” 
The crowd roared with rage, their faces twisted with fury. 
Joan raised her hand to signal for silence, then looked at Lin Tian with a mocking smile. “Well, well, I didn’t expect you to still be alive, Your Goblin Majesty!” 
She had already learned from the Holy Tree Empire about the three major empires’ assassins infiltrating the goblin city. 
But when she suddenly spotted Sara, her expression changed to one of astonishment. “Wait, isn’t that the Trojan princess?!” 
“What, you recognize her?” Lin Tian replied coldly, patting Sara’s side. 
At this sight, Joan was stunned and deeply shocked. “It’s impossible! How could the Trojan princess be with you? Weren’t the Giant Elephant Empire, the Holy Tree Empire, and the other countries sending people to slaughter your kind?” 
Lin Tian sneered. “Ah, so that’s it. You thought I was dead and wanted to carve up my lands in my absence? Too bad for you—all of them are dead, except for Sara.” 
For the first time, Joan’s gaze toward Lin Tian changed. 
No longer casual, it was now filled with wariness. “This is indeed unexpected, but my attack on Twilight City wasn’t for that reason. Liberating these humans—what’s wrong with that?” 
“Wrong? You clearly said you wouldn’t interfere in the affairs of my Goblin Empire, didn’t you? Or do you lack even a shred of integrity?” Lin Tian replied with a mocking tone. “And yet you have the audacity to stand here, painting yourself as some kind of great figure in front of these people?” 
Hearing this, Joan immediately countered, “Goblin, you’ve got it all wrong! What I said was that I wouldn’t interfere unless you gave me a reason to. And these humans, whom you’ve forcibly enslaved, are that reason, aren’t they?” 
“That’s right, you damned goblin! You’ve used me as a breeding tool every day! I wish I could cut you into pieces!”  
“Your Majesty Joan, don’t waste words on him! Kill him!”  
“He’s infuriating, so shameless!” 
The residents, trembling with anger, clenched their teeth so hard they were about to shatter. 
Lin Tian looked at them with contempt. “Are you sure you want to oppose me? If you were merely tools, at least you had food to eat and could live. But once you stand against me, I promise that even if you beg for mercy on your knees, it won’t help…” 
“Enough! You’re next! I was just about to declare war on you!” Joan’s voice thundered, echoing like a storm. 
Lin Tian, unhurried, scoffed, “Fine, then… I accept your declaration of war. Sara, do it.” 
He had felt some trepidation earlier. 
But now that he had mastered Hero’s Power and had the full support of a pure-blooded Trojan princess like Sara, Joan no longer posed any real threat to him. 
There were too many ways to utterly defeat her. 
“Summon Magic · Trojan Meteor!” 
Instantly! 
In the sky above, massive magic arrays formed, blotting out the sun! 
Flames burst forth with blinding light! 
A terrifying heatwave rushed in, so scorching that even the air itself seemed unbearable, suffocating everyone nearby! 
“This grand gift is my declaration of war!”  
As Lin Tian finished speaking, he and Sara quickly retreated into the magic array, vanishing from Twilight City. 
In the square below, a massive meteor, a kilometer in diameter, was blazing as it plummeted toward the ground! 
The sheer pressure of its descent made everyone tremble uncontrollably, the sensation of death looming above them. 
The residents, terrified, scattered in all directions. 
They desperately tried to flee. 
But Joan knew full well that running was futile. There was no escape. 
A meteor of this size would unleash a shockwave capable of destroying everything within a ten-thousand-meter radius. 
No one could outrun it. 
“That bastard!” Joan cursed under her breath. Staring at the rapidly approaching meteor, she gritted her teeth. “Divine Domain!” 
In an instant, she activated her domain. 
Next, she poured all of her magic into the Sword of Faith, “World-Class Magic · Ultimate Holy Sword!” 
The king’s sword suddenly grew to several hundred meters in size, and she swung it toward the meteor in the sky! 
The massive golden sword clashed with the burning meteor, creating a stunning visual spectacle! 
Joan’s fierce shout echoed through the square! 
“Boom!” 
As the two forces collided, a blinding light erupted from the impact! 
Suddenly, the entire world seemed to fall silent. 
No, it wasn’t silence. 
It was the overwhelming sonic wave that left everyone deafened by the sheer force of the explosion!
