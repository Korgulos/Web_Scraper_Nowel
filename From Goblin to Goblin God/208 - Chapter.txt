Chapter 208: Insect Plague, Sweeping Across the Free Empire! 
TL: Sungmin  
“Talking is fine, but… there are a lot of people around here…” Lin Tian said with a troubled expression. 
Behind him. 
A Demon King-level creature was staring right at him. 
The Ant Queen, however, didn’t mind. “Don’t worry, they’re all my minions. Whether they hear us or not, it doesn’t matter. Like you Goblins, I, as their Queen, can control weaker members of the same species.” 
Lin Tian gave a subtle look, signaling towards the Ant King behind him. 
The worker ants and soldier ants weren’t an issue for sure. 
Seeing this, the Ant Queen wasn’t foolish. She caught on to the hint and said, “Ant King, go notify the demonic locusts. Tell their entire swarm to sweep across the Free Empire, leaving not a single grain of food or anything edible!” 
“As you command, Ant Queen,” the Ant King responded with a low, deep voice, full of respect. 
He turned and left. 
After confirming that he was far enough away, Lin Tian finally spoke, “So, Your Majesty the Ant Queen, what is it you have in mind?” 
“Do you know the Zerg Queen? What do you think of her?” The Ant Queen asked, her tone full of ambition, especially emphasizing the word “Queen.” 
Lin Tian remained calm. “I know her. As for my thoughts, I suppose she’s one of the more perfect species, at least in terms of her ability to dominate. She can produce all sorts of minions, much like yourself.” 
“Exactly! But I am far inferior to her. She can alter her own genes, continuously producing stronger minions, all of whom obey her commands. Most importantly, she possesses immense combat power herself. She is a true ruler who, by her strength alone, can build an indestructible empire.” 
The Ant Queen’s eyes burned with madness, her jealousy and envy written all over her face. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian understood. 
The Zerg Queen herself had the combat strength of a top-tier Demon King, whereas the Ant Queen was relatively weak. 
Even if she detached from her bloated abdomen, her combat strength only reached around eight or nine thousand. 
Moreover, the ants she produced were quite limited compared to the Zerg, which boasted over a dozen types of combat insects. 
The Zerg dominated the entire insect ecosystem. 
Lin Tian raised an eyebrow. “So, what are you getting at?” 
“I want to join forces with you, overthrow the Zerg Queen, and seize control of this empire! What do you think?” The Ant Queen spread her slender arms wide, speaking with excitement. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian couldn’t help but be taken aback. 
What was going on? 
She wanted to plot a coup with him? And what about the Ant King, who was secretly nurturing a new Ant Queen? 
As he pondered, he suddenly understood. 
The Ant King’s role in the ant species was to protect them at all costs. 
He must have realized that the Ant Queen’s desire to challenge the Zerg Queen was reckless, fearing it would lead to the extinction of the ant species. 
That’s why the Ant King had been secretly raising a new Ant Queen. 
However, all the female ants produced by the colony were under the control of the current Ant Queen. 
The only way to breed a new Queen was to rely on goblins, who could bypass the reproductive isolation between species, producing a hybrid queen. 
Even if it was the Ant Queen herself, as long as she threatened the safety of the ant species, she had to be eliminated. 
With this, Lin Tian completely understood. 
The Ant Queen, unable to wait, pleaded, “Goblin King, I beg you to help me! I work tirelessly day and night, constantly producing offspring, yet I’m still suppressed by the Zerg. I can’t accept this!!” 
“Squelch, squelch…” 
As she spoke, she forcefully detached herself from the massive, bloated flesh mound she had been attached to, the separation accompanied by disgusting, sticky sounds. 
Her slender lower body emerged. 
Her long legs, elegant like a noblewoman in high heels, exuded an extraordinary grace. 
Her seductive, enchanting eyes seemed almost ready to shed tears. 
She leaped down from midair, throwing herself into Lin Tian’s embrace. “Goblin King, it’s simple for you. Just say yes!” 
For a moment, Lin Tian was caught off guard. 
“Let me think about it. Lately, things have been a bit chaotic,” Lin Tian said, trying to stall. 
He had said so much because he was impressed by the sheer ruling power of the ant species and the Ant Queen’s incredible reproductive ability. 
If he could capture her and use her as a production tool for goblins, the possibilities would be unimaginable! 
There would be no need for humans at all. 
A single Ant Queen would be enough. She could even produce more new Ant Queens, and the goblins’ breeding speed would be incalculable! 
However. 
The Ant Queen wasn’t so easy to capture, and the Zerg Queen also made for a valuable production tool. 
But once an internal conflict broke out among the ants, it would be much easier to capture the Ant Queen. 
“Goblin King, let’s become one. Let’s produce powerful hybrids, invade, conquer, and become the rulers of the Zerg Empire!” 
Suddenly, the Ant Queen impatiently kissed him. 
She was clearly trying to use this method to sway Lin Tian. 
She had even begun trying to pull down his pants. 
The most impressive thing about the Ant Queen was that, with just one pregnancy, she could continuously produce offspring for the rest of her life! 
Unlike the Zerg, where the mother could produce on her own, being hermaphroditic. 
In this regard, the Zerg were still superior. 
However, Lin Tian had no such intentions. He firmly protected himself and pulled away. “Your Majesty, we haven’t discussed everything clearly yet. Let’s not rush things.” 
“Is there even a need to say more? You just need to give me your strength, and I can produce countless powerful hybrids, enough to challenge the Zerg! We could even conquer this continent. When that happens, I’ll give you half of the power! Half of the land! What do you say?” The Ant Queen said eagerly. 
The offer was indeed tempting. 
For Lin Tian, it would be a great deal. He would only need to insert and leave; the difficulty was zero. 
However. 
The Ant Queen’s ambitions were large, but Lin Tian’s ambitions were even larger. 
If he cooperated with the Ant Queen like this, he would only get half the power and land. But if he imprisoned the Ant Queen, he would have it all. 
And she would become a massive production machine. 
Additionally, Goblin genes were more dominant and aggressive. Lin Tian was certain he could maintain full control. 
He then said, “I have some pressing matters to attend to. Could we wait a few days? We can find a quiet place, have a drink, admire the moonlight, and talk until dawn?” 
“No! Once I get pregnant, it’ll take a long time before I can grow a new flesh mound,” the Ant Queen refused, clearly eager to gain Lin Tian’s strength. 
She wanted it all. 
She no longer wished to live in the damp, dark underground nest. She wanted to be revered like the Zerg Queen, worshiped by all races. 
Lin Tian continued to stall, “Your Majesty, I’m a very sentimental person. Don’t be fooled by my appearance as a goblin—actually, I’m still a virgin!” 
“What?!” The Ant Queen was stunned, her eyes wide with disbelief as she stared at Lin Tian. “You… you’re still…?” 
“That’s right!” Lin Tian pretended to be serious, even blushing slightly. “I’m still pure. My first time is still intact… no, I mean, it’s still waiting for the right moment.” 
“What do you want, then?” the Ant Queen asked, her face full of disbelief, though there was now a hint of admiration in her gaze. 
Lin Tian pondered for a moment, “Once I finish what I need to do, we can have a wedding like humans do, and then take things slow.” 
“Alright, you are the most chaste goblin I’ve ever met! I respect you for it! How much longer will it take?” the Ant Queen asked again. 
Estimating the time, Lin Tian responded, “A few months, I think. But, you are the most beautiful ant girl I’ve ever seen. There are stars in your eyes~ I’ve already fallen in love with you.” 
Hearing these words, the Ant Queen couldn’t help but feel overjoyed, even a little bashful. 
She giggled to herself. “Alright then, I’ll wait for you! Make sure you take care of yourself, and when the time comes, we will join hands and become the greatest legends!” 
“Good! I’ll take my leave now!” 
After leaving. 
Lin Tian’s face twisted into a sinister grin as he headed straight back to the Goblin Empire. 
Such a powerful production tool. 
Once the ants broke out into civil war, he could just swoop in and take it all. 
Sure, it wasn’t exactly “human” of him, but Lin Tian wasn’t human to begin with. 
About ten days later. 
Lin Tian finally returned to the Goblin Empire. 
Both the Giant Elephant Empire and the Holy Tree Empire had been completely dealt with, turned into desolate cities. 
He had also developed magical devices with the Snow Elves. 
These powered the large-scale magic teleportation array. 
Whenever needed, the army could be transported instantly. 
“Boss, I heard from Gobu Yue that you went to the Zerg Empire? Was there anything fun?” Gobu Kuang grinned and leaned in close inside the grand hall. 
Lin Tian wore a playful expression, pointing dramatically in a direction (like of Donnie Yen). “You’re really keeping your curiosity alive, huh? Don’t worry, by the time we’re done, we won’t just have the entire Zerg Empire, but at least half of it will be ours. You’ll get to see some new sights and play with new toys.” 
“Hooray for the Boss!!” Gobu Kuang and the other three were incredibly excited upon hearing this. 
Even Osius and Grugia couldn’t hold back and asked, “So, Brother Tian, what about us?” 
“As long as you’re up for it, no problem. Zerg beauties are quite exotic; I personally think they’re not bad at all,” Lin Tian added. 
Judging solely by the Ant Queen, she was quite exceptional. 
Her body was slender and graceful—everything was just right. 
Plus, there were other races like the Butterfly Clan, who were also quite promising. 
Now that everything was in order, the group relaxed in the grand hall, chatting and enjoying the rare leisure time. 
… 
Meanwhile, in the Free Empire. 
Luxurious, towering buildings lined the streets, all constructed under the oppression of slaves by the previous king. 
Purely for aesthetic purposes. 
There were giant owls, huge horse sculptures, all lifelike. 
The whole scene was magnificent. 
On the streets, people bustled about, with children laughing and playing. 
The Free Empire’s population was small, only around two million, but because of Joan of Arc’s strength, the army only had to number around a hundred thousand, without fear of being attacked. 
As a result, the residents lived a relatively good life. 
However, recently, the Free Empire had taken in hundreds of thousands of refugees from the War Empire, and every household had to contribute one-third of their food. 
Meals were starting to feel a bit tight. 
Inside the Free Imperial Council meeting room. 
A group of elders was celebrating, “Your Highness Joan, you are truly the embodiment of both compassion and power! By liberating the War Empire, you’ll gain the devotion of many more people!” 
“Yes, your greatness is etched in our hearts!” 
“Please take care, Your Majesty, and recover soon!” 
Everyone spoke in turn. 
Joan, looking quite pleased, basked in their praise. 
Last time, she had taken a direct hit from Sara. 
Joan of Arc had exhausted all her divine power and had even been wounded by a fragment of a meteorite. At first, she hadn’t noticed, but later she realized that there was a hole pierced through her chest. 
Her leg was also wrapped in bandages. 
“Thank you all for your concern and praise. I am only doing what I must. I act for my people and for the peace of the world, doing what needs to be done,” Joan said in response. 
She added, “As for the food shortage, I’ll handle it. For now, let me check on how the refugees are being settled.” 
She walked onto the streets. 
The residents stood in neat lines, eagerly welcoming her arrival. 
One by one, they shed tears of joy, cheering and exclaiming: 
“Your Highness Joan, the goddess of my heart, please take care! Don’t get hurt again!” 
“Thank you, Your Highness, for saving me from the goblins!” 
“Joan is the true god, the one worthy of our faith!” 
Hearing their words of praise. 
Joan smiled, feeling deeply gratified. “As long as you are all like this, everything feels worthwhile! I also promise everyone, we will overthrow the Goblin Empire!” 
“Bzzzzz!” 
Suddenly. 
From the sky, a loud, urgent sound began to echo. It resembled the rapid vibration of insect wings. 
The noise was sharp, filling everyone with unease. 
When the crowd looked up in the direction of the sound. 
They all gasped in horror! 
A dense mass of creatures, like a dark cloud, blocked out the sky, swarming madly toward the Free Empire! 
Locusts!! 
A massive swarm of locusts! So numerous it was beyond imagination—just one glance was enough to make anyone’s skin crawl! 
Compared to this swarm of locusts. 
The Free Empire’s capital, spanning dozens of miles, seemed like a small boat in the vast ocean! 
Utterly insignificant!
