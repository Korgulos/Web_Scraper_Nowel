Chapter 41: Vampire! 
TL: Sungmin 
Loder was speaking seriously, appearing more clear-headed than ever before. 
Moved to tears, Cecil hugged his leg and cried, “Cousin, I’m sorry for berating you earlier, cousin!” 
“Hehe, a prisoner dares to negotiate with me?” 
Lin Tian showed no mercy and directly cut off one of Cecil’s legs to roast. 
The paralysis caused no pain, but the brutal scene made him faint out of fear! 
A smile curved on Loder’s gloomy face, “Listen to me, how about letting him go? The family will definitely send many people to rescue me then.” 
“Are you out of your mind? What nonsense are you spouting?” Lin Tian looked at him coldly. 
It seemed Loder’s mind had completely collapsed. 
Suddenly, Loder became agitated and yelled, “Out of my mind? You could kill more people then! Devour more powerful ones! Kill them all! I’ll help you do that!” 
“Are you serious?” Lin Tian still doubted. 
Loder laughed maniacally, “They all deserve to die! All of them!!! They didn’t send troops to rescue me for so long and sent this useless guy instead, so they deserve to die! And that whore, if I could, I would help you kill her too!” 
“Alright, I believe you. Ifreya, heal this guy.” Lin Tian agreed directly. 
He ordered Ifreya to come and treat Cecil first. 
Then he walked to the furnace, picked up the roasted leg, and tossed it in front of Loder like feeding a dog. 
He said, “This is your reward.” 
A flash of murderous intent passed through Loder’s eyes, different from usual. 
Immediately, he recovered and began gnawing on the leg, “Delicious! Delicious!” 
“Boss, isn’t this letting the tiger return to the mountain? Our location will be exposed.” Lia expressed her concern. 
Lin Tian gestured to interrupt, “Don’t you trust me?” 
“I understand.” 
Lia said no more. 
In the end, they arranged for a few goblins to carry Cecil out and throw him into the forest. 
… 
Bright Town. 
People knew that Cecil and others had joined forces to exterminate the goblins. 
They were eagerly awaiting good news. 
In the tavern, everyone was drinking and chatting. 
At this time, someone joked, “It’s been so long with no news, did they all get wiped out? Hahaha.” 
“I’d rather believe a goblin can screw me over than that they all got wiped out.” 
“He’s just joking, though it’s unlikely, who knows.” 
“If a team of two Diamond-level adventurers loses, we might as well pack up and leave.” 
No one believed such a thing could happen. 
Just a few goblins, even high-level intelligent ones, were still just goblins. 
They couldn’t stir up much trouble. 
For hundreds of years, stories of goblin kings being killed were frequent. 
The impression of goblins being weak was ingrained in human minds. 
The Wandering Hero said, “Don’t think the Sword Saintess lost, she only lost to herself. Diamond-level adventurers dealing with a bunch of goblins is no pressure, at least not for me.” 
“Bang!” 
At this moment, the tavern door was violently pushed open. 
A bald man in simple leather armor rushed in excitedly, “It’s over! It’s all over! They’re all dead!” 
“What’s over?! Calm down!” 
The tavern owner cursed; that was his door! 
The bald man panted, “I just saw Cecil come back, missing a leg, looking extremely miserable! He rode a carnivorous horse and left Bright Town, heading towards the capital!” 
“What!” 
Everyone’s face changed! 
Cecil of the Blizzard Heroes! A young noble prodigy. 
He actually lost! 
Even the tavern owner found it hard to believe, “The Blizzard Formation can withstand an attack from an army of a thousand. On such a dark night, are you sure you didn’t see wrong?” 
“No mistake, I even asked him what happened!” 
The bald man took a deep breath and continued, “He said they’re all dead. Those goblins are demons, don’t go near them, and then he rode off.” 
At this moment. 
The entire tavern fell into dead silence! 
Such goblins existed, beyond their imagination. 
They finally understood why the Sword Saintess suffered a setback. 
The Wandering Hero couldn’t help but exclaim, “The Gray Hats are all dead? Old Gru, I remember, had some strength.” 
“He’s the only one who came back, they must all be dead.” The bald man speculated. 
At this moment, Goblin Slayer’s figure entered the tavern, speaking coldly, “That’s right, they’re all dead, only Cecil is alive.” 
“Goblin Slayer? You were in that battle too?!” 
Everyone was ecstatic; thankfully, there was someone alive to get details of the battle. 
Goblin Slayer nodded, “I happened to meet them, but unfortunately, I arrived a bit late. By the time I got there, they were almost all dead, only Cecil survived.” 
She didn’t understand why Lin Tian let him go, but she could only say this for now. 
The Wandering Hero asked, “What about those goblins?” 
“I killed them all.” Goblin Slayer said indifferently. 
The entire room was stunned for a few seconds. 
Someone started clapping, followed by a wave of applause! 
“Sir, drink as much as you want today, it’s on the house!” The tavern owner said excitedly. 
He had suffered from goblin attacks for a long time, and now that the menace was finally eliminated, he was thrilled. 
Everyone marveled, “As expected of the man known as Goblin Slayer, a true professional against goblins. Can you tell us more?” 
“Nothing special, just one mutant variant, two hero variants, and a few hundred big ones.” 
Goblin Slayer said as she took the cup handed to him by the tavern owner. 
She lifted her mask slightly and drank it all in one go. 
Everyone was shocked again, “My god, so many large ones, no wonder Cecil and his team lost, and there was even a mutant variant!” 
While everyone was immersed in their drinks and cheers, a swarm of black bats flew in from outside, hanging upside down on the ceiling. 
Everyone retreated in fear, some grabbing weapons, spilling their drinks all over. 
The more timid ones even ran out, panicking like they’d seen the plague. 
It wasn’t that these men were afraid of bats. 
Rather, these bats were actually people, or rather, vampires! 
They were the Cold-Blooded Mercenaries! 
On the ceiling, a bat with blood-red teeth spoke, “Goblin Slayer, you said there were hundreds of big variants. The leader of this tribe couldn’t just be a mere mutant variant. Did you find their nest? Goblins hide very well.” 
Hearing this, everyone realized the truth. 
Indeed, with hundreds of big variants, there had to be thousands of low-level goblins! 
The leader had to be an overlord-level being! 
If looks could kill, the bat would have felt a chill down its spine from Goblin Slayer’s cold gaze. 
She hadn’t expected another troublesome group to appear. 
But suddenly, she smiled and thought, “Heh heh heh… My dear, I believe you can handle these guys, right? I didn’t find the nest. After killing them, I came back.” 
“Is that so? Well, you can leave the task of finding the nest to us. We’d love to join forces with you, how about it?” The red-fanged bat said again. 
The Wandering Hero couldn’t believe it, “Even the Cold-Blooded Mercenaries wants to team up? I want to meet these goblins myself.” 
“Then let’s go together?” 
The red-fanged bat looked at him. 
The Wandering Hero smiled awkwardly, “Forget it, I’m supposed to slay dragons, not goblins, and I’m not interested in bounty hunting.” 
“I don’t like moving at night.” Goblin Slayer said and left the tavern. 
The red-fanged bat was a bit disappointed, “What a pity, we can only operate at night. Otherwise, Gru and his team wouldn’t have met such a fate. Let’s move out, my kin.” 
“Screech! Screech!” 
A swarm of bats flapped out of the tavern. 
They flew towards the enchanted forest. 
… 
At this time, a well-equipped knight riding a carnivorous horse arrived swiftly at Bright Town. 
After asking around, he found the room where the Sword Saintess was staying. 
The door was tightly shut, and despite it being just after dusk, the lights were already out. 
The knight sighed, took out a letter, and slipped it under the door, then turned to leave. 
… 
Above the enchanted forest, the bats, being vampires, had the advantage at night. 
They had excellent vision, quick reflexes, and a keen sense of smell. It didn’t take long for them to catch the strong scent of blood. 
It was coming from across the river, several kilometers away, from the uncleaned battle site. 
The bats hung upside down on the trees, pondering the battle traces. 
“Leader, what do you think? There doesn’t seem to be a large tribe around here.” One bat asked. 
The red-fanged bat sniffed carefully, then its eyes gleamed with a sinister red light, “Go back, they left this on purpose!” 
Following the scent, they quickly returned to the riverbank. 
They hovered around a waterfall. 
The red-fanged bat smirked, “The scent stops here, they’re definitely inside! Let’s go!” 
With that, the swarm dove into the waterfall. 
Sure enough, they saw two big goblins patrolling inside. 
“Bats?” 
“Ignore them, stay alert.” 
The two large ones commented, paying no further attention. 
After all, why would monsters care about a bunch of bats? 
It was nothing unusual. 
The red-fanged bat led the way, quietly infiltrating deeper into the cave, reaching the living area. 
Inside, the goblins were all sound asleep. 
They were snoring blissfully. 
The bats didn’t act immediately, but silently scoped out the entire cave. 
The red-fanged bat was surprised, “There are so few goblins? And only one mutant variant?” 
“Could we have the wrong place? This seems like a medium-sized tribe.” 
The members were puzzled. 
The red-fanged bat was sure, “No mistake, with so many big goblins, it’s just as Goblin Slayer said. Let’s feast, drink your fill!” 
“Though goblin blood tastes bad, it’s very nutritious!” 
One bat said as it quietly climbed onto a sleeping goblin. 
Its sharp teeth gently pierced the skin, like an ant bite, unnoticed by the deeply sleeping goblin. 
In just over ten seconds, the previously robust big goblin turned into a dried corpse. 
The red-fanged bat also drank heartily, “Tonight, drink to your fill!” 
The Cold-Blooded Mercenaries had killed many powerful opponents in this silent, deadly manner.
