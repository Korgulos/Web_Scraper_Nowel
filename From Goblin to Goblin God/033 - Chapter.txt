Chapter 33: A Large Number of Adventurers Appear! 
TL: Sungmin 
It happened so quickly that Lin Tian didn’t see their attributes and identities clearly. 
But he could guess they were definitely not ordinary people. 
Their attire was quite ordinary, so he estimated they were adventurers. 
Maybe they were passing adventurers looking for a place to stay, and Lin Tian didn’t think much of it. 
However, after a while, another group arrived. 
This time, Lin Tian saw clearly. They were ordinary, just a silver-level adventurer team, as mentioned in the panel titles. 
Not worth paying attention to at all. 
Just pure weaklings. 
“Hiss, something’s wrong. I’m 90% sure something’s wrong!” Lin Tian couldn’t help but say. 
Because soon another group of people arrived, one after another, at least a hundred people entered Bright Town in a day! 
And the key was, they were all adventurers! 
Each person’s panel title provided an introduction. 
Lin Tian said, “Did we poke an adventurer’s nest? There are twenty teams, three Diamond-level, and even one Epic-level!” 
You must know that Loder and his group were platinum-level before, not even reaching Diamond-level. 
In this world, the badges of adventurer teams had specific divisions. 
They were Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum, Diamond, Epic, Legendary, Mythic-class, Immortal-lass, and World-class. 
Adventurers who earned a Diamond badge were already among the elite, very capable. 
Not to mention Epic-level; their stories had to be widely circulated throughout the empire. 
Like the saying “someone else’s child,” meaning they were exemplary. 
Lin Tian felt something was wrong and immediately decided to return to the tribe to lead everyone in relocating; they couldn’t stay here. 
“Boss, the new batch of goblins has basically grown up, but the resources in the forest are too scarce, and everyone is almost starving.” 
At this time, Lia came to report. 
Gobu Yue also spoke, “The iron ore is almost exhausted, and many new goblins can’t wear iron armor or wield weapons, creating a significant disparity in strength.” 
Gobu Yue and the elves mainly handled the tribe’s logistics. 
They managed very well, giving Lin Tian peace of mind. 
Since that was the case, Lin Tian instructed everyone, “Pack your things. Today, right now, we are moving!” 
“Moving? Boss, what’s going on?” Gobu Shan couldn’t help but ask. 
Gobu Kuang and Gobu Tian were also puzzled, having lived here for so long, it was the first time they heard about moving. 
Lin Tian didn’t explain much, “The resources here are insufficient, and we must move to a resource-rich place to develop our bodies and minds.” 
Indeed, for body and mind development, because the third-generation goblins didn’t have enough experience points to level up and evolve. 
Like foot soldiers, if anyone could just come and take them out, what was the point of painstaking cultivation? 
Of course, the main concern was fearing Bright Town’s potential siege. 
If they all stayed here, it would be a disaster. 
“Additionally, listen carefully. During migration, move quietly and steadily. Lia, Gobu Yue, you and the elves handle cleaning up our tracks.” Lin Tian said. 
Having elves, who were meticulous stealth experts, clean up tracks was ideal. 
Immediately, two to three hundred goblins began the big move. 
They took useful resources, including breeding tools, and prepared to set off. 
At this moment, Lia pointed to the side and said, “Boss, what about that guy?” 
That guy referred to Loder. 
“Damn, I forgot about him. He’s still alive with grass growing on him?” 
Lin Tian was startled, amazed at Loder’s resilience. 
Loder suddenly spoke, “Don’t kill me, take me with you. I want to see you kill that bitch with my own eyes, okay? I beg you, I’ve been holding on for that day to come.” 
“Hmph, how could I let you die so easily? When I caught you, I said you’d beg for life and death in vain.” 
Then, he assigned Ifreya to drag him along. 
They joined the migrating group. 
There wasn’t much to take from the tribe, just some iron ore, basic resources like cloth, rope, and pots, and equipment. 
And most importantly, breeding tools. 
Lin Tian had already scouted a new place for survival, riding a dragon. 
A waterfall cave over a hundred kilometers away. 
That cave was very deep and very large, complex, with many small and large caves. 
It was suspected to be a dungeon. 
Even with Gobu Kuang’s size, many places were so high that he couldn’t reach the top even if he jumped. 
But some places were very low and narrow. 
“Boss, how much farther exactly?” On the way, Lia couldn’t help but ask. 
Because they had already passed through the enchanted forest and entered a normal environment. 
The surroundings were regular woods, not very dense, lush green and quite pleasant. 
As far as she knew, to reach the next enchanted forest, it was at least two hundred kilometers away! 
Lin Tian calmly said, 
“We’re almost there, do you hear the sound of the river?” 
“Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh…” 
Sure enough, not far away, the sound of rushing river water could be heard. 
When they passed through the dense forest, their view suddenly broadened. In front of them was a clear river. 
It was about ten meters wide. 
A high waterfall was located upstream, dozens of meters away. 
Both sides were covered with lush green grass, and they could even see cattle and sheep grazing on the other side of the river. 
A vigilant lamb suddenly raised its head and noticed Lin Tian and his group. 
Immediately, all the animals scattered. 
“So much roast lamb and beef, hahaha!” 
Gobu Tian laughed, eager to catch a few for a taste. 
They had been hungry for a long time in the enchanted forest and hadn’t eaten such good things in a while. 
Lin Tian stopped him, “Come here. Without my orders, no one is allowed to act rashly during this period.” 
The situation in Bright Town was extremely abnormal, and they had to be cautious. 
They must not expose their whereabouts, or finding this cave would be in vain. 
He then led everyone toward the waterfall. Behind the water curtain, a dark, bottomless cave appeared. 
The cave wasn’t particularly large. It could be described as narrow at first, then opening up after walking several dozen steps. 
Gobu Tian could barely enter. 
They could expand it later, but for now, they didn’t have time. 
They brought all their resources into the cave. 
Lin Tian had roughly planned it out. The cave was divided into three large interconnected chambers, each covering several thousand square meters, though not very even. 
There were many rugged rocks, stalactites, and crystals inside. 
One chamber was for living, one for breeding, and one for sleeping. 
There were also four or five medium-sized chambers for storing items and over a dozen small chambers. 
The small chambers were not useful now but would be valuable if enemies invaded. 
“Lia, Gobu Yue, you two take the goblins and clean these three large chambers. Knock down those stalactites and level the ground as much as possible.” Lin Tian instructed. 
Lia, somewhat afraid, picked Lin Tian up and held him in her soft embrace, “But Boss, we elves can’t see well in the dark.” 
Reluctantly, they had to light a few torches, but this could lead to oxygen depletion. 
If they all suffocated to death here, it would be truly disastrous. 
“I’ll find some underground vents. Gobu Kuang, come with me.” 
Lin Tian took out an iron chisel he had made. 
After searching the ground for a long time, their efforts paid off, and they found an underground vent. 
Gobu Kuang went to work with the chisel, and soon a strong wind was blowing into the cave, solving the problem. 
A day passed. 
The situation in the cave stabilized. 
Lin Tian gathered all the goblins and elves in the living area, “I have three things to say. 
1. Gobu Tian, you will lead the goblin assassins for hunting. No one else is allowed to go out without my permission. 
2. Every day, two goblins will patrol and stand guard at the cave entrance. Report any movement immediately, but don’t leave the waterfall and expose yourselves. 
3. Everyone in the cave must follow the rules! Don’t let me catch anyone being careless! The penalty is death!” 
“Yes, Boss!” 
“Long live the Boss! We’ll all listen to the Boss!” 
Before long, Gobu Tian and his group captured a dozen wild cows. They lit a bonfire in the cave and started roasting whole cows. 
However, the elves were vegetarians. 
Lin Tian trusted them not to expose their whereabouts, so they were allowed to come and go freely and solve their own food issues. 
There were far more fruits and vegetables around than in their previous location, more than enough to eat. 
“Hmph, you’re really something, finding such a hidden cave. Easy to defend and hard to attack. Even an army couldn’t get in. What’s this? Has imperial support arrived?” Loder sneered at this moment. 
Lin Tian glanced at him, “Smart guess. Bright Town suddenly saw an influx of adventurer teams. They probably plan to besiege us.” 
“Adventurers? What about imperial support?” Loder was puzzled. 
Lin Tian shrugged, “I don’t know. I only saw a large number of adventurers arriving.” 
Suddenly, Loder burst into laughter, “Those stingy bastards probably heard that the Sword Saintess failed and were too scared to come! Only these reckless adventurers dare to face you. 
But I must warn you, these adventurers are far stronger than the Imperial Knight Regiment. 
The Imperial Knight Regiment was just trained and educated, but adventurers are different. They’ve all survived countless life-and-death battles! Hahahaha!” 
In the dim firelight, Loder’s face looked especially sinister as he laughed. 
“Shut up!” 
Lin Tian threw a bloody cowhide at him, silencing his nasty face. 
After eating and drinking their fill, Lin Tian went outside the waterfall. 
He whistled, and the bipedal dragon now named “Xiao Huan” flew over from a distant peak. 
“Let’s go, Xiao Huan. We’ll go back and check the situation.” 
… 
Bright Town. 
After months of silence, it finally saw new life. 
Hundreds of adventurers gathered, and the lively noise continued through the night. 
In the tavern. 
“Bang!” 
Someone took a big gulp and slammed the cup on the table, “Ah! So refreshing! Hey, do you think the Sword Saintess can recover?” 
“I doubt it. The era of the Sword Saintess may have ended.” 
“If it were me lying flat in a room for months, I’d have gone crazy by now!” 
Amidst the laughter, everyone couldn’t help but show a look of pity. 
They had all come after hearing that the Sword Saintess was driven to collapse by a group of goblins. 
First, to see if the rumors about the Sword Saintess were true. 
Second, if it was true, they wanted to check out the goblin tribe that managed to defeat her. 
This event was world-shaking. 
It wasn’t just the Lionheart Empire; people from other nations were also talking, mostly mocking. 
The dignified Sword Saintess, driven to collapse by goblins. 
It was like an adult being thrown by ants.
