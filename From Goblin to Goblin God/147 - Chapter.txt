Chapter 147: The Crazy and Powerful Woman 
TL: Sungmin 
Seeing Lin Tian and his group, the young boy quickly abandoned the acorn and crawled over in a hurry. “Big sis, big brother, can you save my little brother? There are so many bugs on him!” 
The expression of the One-Eyed Owl changed slightly. “Little brother, come with me!” 
Saying this, she picked up the young boy with one hand, mounted her carnivorous horse, and rushed in the direction he had come from. 
Lin Tian followed closely behind. 
They didn’t travel far. 
Soon, they saw a series of shacks built from thick trees. 
It must have been the Ironhorn Tribe’s camp. 
At a glance, they saw a young boy lying on the ground, covered in blood. 
A black, shiny beetle, like an enlarged rhinoceros beetle, was perched on the boy’s belly. 
With its sharp, pointed mouth, it bit into the tender skin and flesh. 
It sucked out the fluids inside. 
It was sticky and mushy, the sound of its eating was utterly disgusting. 
It was a mixture of organs and blood, all shredded together. 
Even though Lin Tian was a goblin and had seen many disgusting scenes, this was a first for him! 
At that moment, another beetle, slightly larger than a human, approached. 
Using its steel-like claws, it lightly touched the boy’s head, creating a bloody hole. 
It continued to suck. 
“Who knew humans could taste so delicious!” 
“Hmph, from now on, we’ll eat them every day!” 
“They deserve this!” 
“We’ll avenge our dead children, eating every human!” 
Witnessing this scene, the One-Eyed Owl’s entire body began to emit a crimson aura, as if it were burning! 
It was her uncontrollable battle spirit! 
In an instant, she disappeared from her spot, leaving behind only the trembling space and a violent gust of wind that swept up countless fallen leaves! 
The next second, she descended from the sky, her heavy fists smashing into the two beetles that were feasting on the humans! 
“Boom!” 
The sound was like a nuclear explosion! 
The terrifying impact blew over all the surrounding oak trees! 
The shacks in the beetle camp were even more thoroughly destroyed, not a single one remained intact! 
The thick layer of fallen leaves filled the sky like an ocean. 
After a long while, everything calmed down. 
Lin Tian finally saw the One-Eyed Owl’s position. The ground had been smashed into a large pit. 
One beetle had been blasted away, its whereabouts unknown. 
The beetle that was hit had its back split open, oozing thick green liquid. 
White and black innards were forcibly squeezed out from its mouth and tail. 
It looked disgusting and terrifying. 
What was even more surprising was that despite such an earth-shattering punch, it only deformed the beetle slightly. 
It didn’t shatter or explode. 
Remember, the giant fire-breathing salamander earlier had its head blown off. 
The One-Eyed Owl was clearly struggling a bit. 
In the air, the sound of insect wings flapping was heard, their thin wings under the shell flapping rapidly. 
A large number of beetles began to gather in this direction! 
They were so numerous that they covered the sky! 
Their black eyes and shiny shells, every part of their bodies was hard and reflective, their limbs gleaming like razors! 
A long, powerful horn, like a crown. 
The sense of oppression was overwhelming! 
The lead beetle was even larger, about three meters tall. 
Lin Tian quickly checked the defense of these creatures.

The Ironhorn Chief retracted its wings, landing heavily with a thud! 
Its presence was imposing and grand! 
Its deep black eyes glanced over everyone. 
“You damned humans, have you become so arrogant as to attack my tribe?” the Ironhorn Chief said coldly. 
Its voice was very low and thick, as if it had the confidence to kill everyone. 
The One-Eyed Owl was incredibly arrogant. “Hmph, attacking your tribe? I saw your tribe members eating innocent children, you damned bug!” 
“That’s what you deserve. You slaughter our children, so your children should…” 
The Ironhorn Chief didn’t get to finish. 
The One-Eyed Owl sneered with disdain. “Blah, blah, blah! I’ll smash you to pulp first!!!” 
“Bang!” 
The astonishing force of her punch stirred up a cloud of dust! 
The shockwave made the trees several dozen meters behind them sway violently! 
However, 
The Ironhorn Chief stood firmly in place. 
He extended his hand, easily blocking the punch, and the barbs on his palm pierced into the One-Eyed Owl’s fist. 
Blood quickly seeped out. 
The claws of an insect were also a formidable and sharp weapon. 
But the One-Eyed Owl didn’t care. She forcibly extended her fist, watching as the flesh was torn, the wound widening. 
She then threw another fierce punch at the Ironhorn Chief’s chest! 
“Boom!” 
The sound of an exploding bomb echoed! 
The space rippled! 
Unfortunately, it was entirely different from what she had imagined. Instead of flying backward, the Ironhorn Chief only took half a step back, somewhat surprised. “For a human, and a female at that, your strength is indeed terrifying, but…” 
“Boom!” 
The next second. 
His fist also struck the One-Eyed Owl. 
The scene she had envisioned now happened! 
The One-Eyed Owl shot out like an arrow from a bow, flying straight for hundreds of meters, crashing through one thick tree after another! 
If it had been a normal person, they would have been pulverized! 
The gust of wind from her flight made the carnivorous horses restless and unsteady. 
“Kill them.” 
At this moment, the Ironhorn Chief looked coldly at Lin Tian. 
“Buzz buzz buzz!” 
A swarm of beetles lowered their heads, aiming their iron horns at them. 
They accelerated, charging downwards! 
Lin Tian frowned, retreating. 
He saw a group of carnivorous horses and young boys riding them. 
In an instant, they were crushed into pieces! 
Scattered everywhere, blood splattering! 
After watching for so long, Lin Tian understood that these creatures had extremely strong defense and strength. 
Each one had an overall combat power of 7 to 8,000. 
If a fight broke out, they might not even be able to win because of the extreme defense these creatures had. 
Plus, there were hundreds of them. 
“Whoosh!” 
Suddenly, a towering figure stood in front of Lin Tian. “Did I say you could touch him!?” 
“Swish swish swish swish!!!” 
In an instant, the wind from the punches whistled, and all that could be seen were dense afterimages! 
The attacks landed on more than ten nearby beetles, instantly smashing them into pulp! 
Sticky fluids splattered everywhere! 
The residual impact of the punches also pushed back the other beetles. 
Seeing this, the Ironhorn Chief’s expression turned serious. “Fall back, I’ll handle this female human.” 
“Kid, stay back too. These guys are tougher than I thought, but tough opponents are better. I’m tired of squishy ones!” The One-Eyed Owl said confidently. 
She pushed Lin Tian away. 
From a distance, Lin Tian could see her fists were already torn, exposing bone. 
Yet she still wanted to fight. 
She truly was a lunatic. 
The next second. 
The One-Eyed Owl unleashed her full power! A crimson aura surrounded her body as she punched back and forth around the Ironhorn Chief like a ghost! 
Each strike made the space ripple! 
The sound was as piercing as thunder! 
The Ironhorn Chief merely protected his head, standing still. “What terrifying strength and speed. To think you can fight our Ironhorn Tribe to this extent—you’re the first!” 
“Unfortunately, I won’t forgive the sins your kind has committed!” 
As he spoke, four black, hardened arms extended from his abdomen. 
He forcibly grabbed the One-Eyed Owl, activating the skill ‘Death Embrace!’ 
He intended to crush her with absolute strength! 
Anyone who has played with insects knows not to underestimate their small arms. 
If they grab your finger, you have to use great force and endure the pain to pull it off. Even a grasshopper can do this, let alone the Hercules of the insect world: 
The rhinoceros beetle. 
Lin Tian was stunned by what he heard. These bugs had been saying humans deserved it and were unforgivable. 
It felt like there was something fishy going on here. 
But now wasn’t the time to think about it. 
The One-Eyed Owl seemed to be in danger. 
She was being squeezed tighter and tighter, the sharp claws even cutting into her tenderest parts, drawing blood. 
The beetles in the sky were ecstatic. “This human is done for!” 
“Hmph, the Chief’s Death Embrace can crush boulders into powder, and he often practices on thick oak trees. A fragile human will easily be crushed into pieces!” 
“The power of six arms is something she can’t withstand.” 
They all believed victory was in sight. 
Remember, if it could crush stones and trees into powder. 
You could imagine how powerful it was. 
“Competing in brute strength?! I’m more than happy to give it a try!!!” 
At this moment, the One-Eyed Owl still spoke with great confidence. 
Her aura started rotating and changing with her breathing like a Tai Chi master! 
She took a deep breath, filling her lungs. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s eyes turned completely red! 
Then the sound of her muscles tightening was heard. 
Crackling, the wind was pulled tight! 
It was extremely shocking! 
Veins bulged prominently, and her fists crackled as she struggled with all her might! 
The Ironhorn Chief’s expression changed dramatically, “No, impossible! How can a human possess such strength?!” 
“Crack!” 
On the spot, one of his smaller arms broke! 
Green mucus oozed everywhere. 
Then three more arms broke! 
Had he not let go in time, he would have lost all his hands. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s current state was as if she were not human anymore, but a ferocious and terrifying beast! 
She bared her teeth, revealing two canines, her eyes glowing red! 
Breathing heavily, the crimson aura around her body surged with each breath. 
Her muscle definition appeared like a set of armor covering her entire body. 
Elegant yet deadly! 
The Ironhorn Chief used another deadly move, “Fatal Impact!” 
He lowered his head, aiming his sharp, elongated horn at the One-Eyed Owl and charged! 
Facing the attack, she grabbed the long horn with her hand, stepped back with her left leg, and powered through her waist and hips! 
She formed a stable stance! 
With a powerful lift, she threw the Ironhorn Chief, sending him crashing into a swarm of beetles! 
“Chief! Damn it, let’s go!” 
“Kill these damned humans!” 
“We don’t believe she has the stamina to kill us all!” 
Hundreds of beetles charged at the One-Eyed Owl in unison! 
The sound of fists clashing with sharp carapaces continuously erupted, like thunder! 
With each punch, she sent a beetle flying hundreds or even thousands of meters away! The air itself trembled! 
They burst into goo upon impact! 
But over time, the One-Eyed Owl’s fists became a bloody mess, her bones cracking. 
This was extremely dangerous. 
Yet she couldn’t stop attacking, laughing maniacally as if addicted, “Keep going! Keep coming! Come at me, you filthy bugs!!!”
