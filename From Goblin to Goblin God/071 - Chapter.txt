Chapter 71: Are You Taking Me for the God of Childbearing? 
TL: Sungmin  
The Iguana Lord didn’t even have time to scream. 
He died on the spot! 
Everyone was shocked by this scene, their faces full of vigilance and suspicion. 
Whoever could kill him instantly must be incredibly strong. 
“Is it… the Cannibal Eagle senior?” Lin Tian guessed aloud. 
Logically, he was the only one who could help him here. 
The Iguana Lord’s corpse split open and fell to the ground, revealing the figure of the person behind it. 
This person was wearing a white nightgown, somewhat dirty. 
Their blond hair was disheveled, as if it hadn’t been taken care of in a long time. 
They looked extremely weak. 
Their bright blue eyes were wide open, as if they had seen something unbelievable, “Finally… found you…” 
After saying this, their eyes rolled back, and they collapsed from exhaustion. 
Stunned! 
A group of goblins broke out in goosebumps, panicking and running around! 
“Disaster! The Sword Saintess has invaded the tribe!” 
“Boss, you go first, I’ll hold her off!” 
“Waaah, we’re gonna get killed!” 
The goblins had all kinds of reactions, mostly fear and panic. 
Lin Tian also took a few steps back, shocked and in disbelief, raising his hand to stop them, “Everyone calm the hell down! Are you blind? That crazy woman has fainted.” 
Immediately. 
Gobu Kuang blinked, “Seems like it…” 
“This person chased us all the way here, took out the Iguana Lord with a rusty sword while being this weak? Luckily, she passed out.” Lin Tian said with lingering fear. 
Looking at her somewhat dirty but still lovely face, he couldn’t help but remember that time. 
Now, the Sword Saintess looked more like an angel fallen into the mud. 
Gobu Kuang picked up his weapons, an axe in one hand and a black iron sword in the other, “Let’s take her life while she’s weak! Gobu Tian, here you go…” 
“I don’t want to, you do it. It’s your weapon.” Gobu Tian said, somewhat scared. 
The two of them then looked at Gobu Shan. 
He pretended to be very busy, staring at the stool in front of him, “Wow, this stool is really stool-like, don’t you think, Boss?” 
“Get lost, you cowards! She’s fainted and you don’t dare to kill her? Besides, who said to kill her? She’s worth much more alive than dead. Tie her up first.” Lin Tian said, eyes full of cunning. 
An angel fallen into the mud… that’s just a fallen angel. 
If she really chose to fall, there was a chance to make her his own. 
Immediately. 
They tied up the Sword Saintess securely. 
Gobu Yue and the others came over to watch the commotion, “Boss, aren’t you guys being too cautious?” 
Looking at her, they almost didn’t recognize her as a person. 
She looked more like a cocoon, wrapped in countless ropes, with only her head sticking out. 
“Better safe than sorry, she is the strongest among the young generation in the empire, almost as strong as the Lionheart Emperor.” Goblin Slayer spoke up. 
She had mingled with humans the longest, so her words carried weight. 
Lin Tian nodded, “Exactly, let’s see what she wants when she wakes up.” 
Everyone waited anxiously. 
Their hearts were all tense. 
After all, this was the Sword Saintess! They had captured the Sword Saintess! 
It would be an incredible story to tell. 
Just a stroke of luck. 
One day and night passed, everyone waited around her, though Lin Tian had already consumed the Iguana Lord’s corpse. 
The days and nights felt long. 
Lin Tian was getting impatient, “Damn, is she sleeping or unconscious?” 
Upon hearing this, Gobu Yue looked at the Sword Saintess’s sleeping face, carefully reaching out a finger to poke her. 
“Eek~” 
Gobu Yue shivered all over, “So soft, like jelly!” 
This poke really broke the Sword Saintess’s dream bubble. 
She slowly opened her beautiful eyes, looking around in surprise. 
“Careful!” 
Gobu Shan and the others jumped back ten meters in a flash. 
Even tied up, they felt being too close was deadly. 
Lin Tian wasn’t as dramatic, but he was very cautious, looking at her seriously, “Long time no see, Sword Saintess…” 
The two of them were old enemies. 
It was their first time talking so closely. 
Last time, although they were intimately close, she had been unconscious. 
Seeing Lin Tian, the Sword Saintess’s eyes seemed to sparkle, “Goblin! I finally found you, Goblin! Finally found you!” 
Her sudden excitement scared Lin Tian. 
He also took a step back, dodging away, “What do you want? If you want to fight, I advise you to give up. You’re no match for us anymore.” 
“Goblin! Goblin!” 
Alicenia seemed like a persistent shadow, even though her body was tied up, she still wriggled like a fat caterpillar. 
Twisting her body, she crawled towards Lin Tian little by little. 
Her speed was incredibly fast! 
Lin Tian was so scared he bolted, unable to comprehend this bizarre scene, “Hey, you lot! I’ve been feeding you all this time, hold her down!” 
Upon hearing this, Gobu Kuang and the others didn’t hesitate. 
They quickly and anxiously moved behind the Sword Saintess, grabbing the rope. 
But in their haste, they grabbed the knot. 
The Sword Saintess’s entire body was freed from the ropes, which fell off her like peeling an apple! 
It was as if she had broken free from a seal, instantly darting to Lin Tian’s side. 
“It’s over! You guys are useless!” 
Lin Tian felt a sinking dread, realizing he had been set up! 
He still had one life left, but next time he would definitely kill the Sword Saintess to eliminate future trouble! 
Gobu Tian slapped his own face in despair, “Gobu Kuang! You’ve killed the boss!” 
“Aaah, boss!!!” 
Gobu Kuang was on the verge of tears, panicking and not knowing what to do. 
The other goblins, filled with despair and helplessness, knelt and wept! 
It was as if they were already holding a memorial service for Lin Tian. 
However, to their surprise, the Sword Saintess did not attack but knelt before Lin Tian! 
Her eyes were filled with humility and pleading, “Goblin, I did not come to fight you. I came to ask… would you give me… another child?” 
A blush crept over Alicenia’s face, and her voice turned shy and hesitant. 
The entire place fell silent. 
“So it was just a dream, how thrilling.” 
Gobu Tian exhaled, turning to kick Gobu Kuang, “Damn!” 
It wasn’t a dream! 
Goblin Slayer stood in shock, “That woman… actually…” 
In the human world, her revered and majestic figure was known to all. 
Now, she knelt before Lin Tian, begging for… love? 
The most shocked of all was Lin Tian, “No way, Sword Saintess, are you serious???” 
He had guessed she might fall from grace. 
But falling from grace didn’t mean wasting time idly, did it? 
Who starts by asking someone for a child? 
Are you taking me for the God of Childbearing? 
“I am serious. Our enmity can be wiped clean, but you must give me another child. Otherwise, I won’t forgive you!” 
Alicenia’s expression was resolute, even threatening. 
Lin Tian didn’t rush to agree, sensing something was off. 
He asked, “You said ‘another,’ meaning you bore our child last time? Where is that child now?” 
At this, Alicenia trembled, tears slipping from her beautiful eyes as she looked at him, “My lord, I failed to fulfill that punishment! It’s those villagers’ fault. Please give me another chance, and I’ll bear a goblin child and raise it!” 
She ignored everyone else, lost in what she believed to be a divine mandate. 
This was her punishment for killing dozens of imperial soldiers. 
The Holy Sword of the church, passed down for thousands of years, had never been used against its own people. 
She was the first. 
The coincidental loss of her holy power made her believe it was divine punishment. 
Seeing her state, Lin Tian speculated, “I see, punishment, another chance, to bear another goblin.” 
Got it, she was taking him for the God of Childbearing. 
“Stand up first. To think the proud Sword Saintess is now so miserable… well, killing so many of your own people, of course, God would be angry.” 
Lin Tian intentionally rubbed salt in the wound. 
This way, the Sword Saintess would think others agreed with her, strengthening her belief. 
Alicenia became desperate, “Please, give me what I ask, I beg you!” 
She started to remove her white nightgown, but Lin Tian stopped her, “I didn’t say I would give it to you. If you want it, there are conditions.” 
“What conditions? I’ll agree to anything!” 
Alicenia’s unstable mind could think of nothing but having another child and obtaining divine forgiveness. 
Essentially, she was trying to escape the reality of her killings. 
Lin Tian thought for a moment, “You must obey me, at least during your penance. I believe this also counts as divine punishment.” 
Such powerful combat strength would be a waste not to use. 
Hearing this, Alicenia agreed without hesitation, “If it’s divine punishment, I’ll complete it! Quickly, I can’t wait any longer!” 
She dragged Lin Tian towards a hut. 
Since she agreed, Lin Tian didn’t hold back. 
After all, such a body was rare. 
Inside the hut. 
Alicenia’s eyes were dreamy, her blue pupils seemed to sparkle with love. 
Removing her nightgown, she lay in the straw like a pure white jade, her cheeks flushed. 
Though her spirit was impatient, her long, pale legs were tightly closed, as if resisting something. 
Perhaps it was the last shred of dignity of the once noble and holy Sword Saintess. 
When Lin Tian’s hand parted her legs, the title of Saintess ceased to exist. 
Outside the hut. 
Gobu Yue and the others listened with their ears perked. 
The noise even attracted Lilith and her group of vampires. 
“What happened earlier? I fell asleep and missed it. Did an enemy invade? No, this sound seems like…” 
Lilith curiously asked, a bit embarrassed. 
Goblin Slayer smiled mischievously, “Do you know who is making that sound?”
