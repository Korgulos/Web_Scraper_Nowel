Chapter 101: A Divine Game, or Malicious Amusement 
TL: Sungmin 
“God, are you toying with us?” 
Watching the departing army, an old woman shed a bitter tear. 
Why were monsters so cruel? 
Was it the deliberate intention of the gods who created them? 
They clearly didn’t have to be this way, yet they were. 
Doubt arose in her heart. 
But it was just that—doubt. 
Beside her, an old man sighed, looking even older, “The monsters aren’t wrong, nor are humans. Who is to blame them…? We now fight monsters for our survival, because monsters are brutal and bloodthirsty by nature.” 
The old man and the old woman couldn’t understand. 
They seemed to grasp something but dared not think further. 
The power of the gods surpassed all. 
They could only hope their only son in the army would return alive. 
… 
In the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
The sounds of forging hammers clanged incessantly. 
Furnace fires roared with heat waves. 
The monsters have already eaten a vast number of breeding tools, significantly boosting everyone’s strength. 
The previously overcrowded tribe now had some room to move. 
With the battle imminent, those breeding machines were of no further use. 
So, they were simply eaten. 
Except for the thousand humans kept alive. 
Being precious resources, they wouldn’t be wasted. 
With sleepless and tireless forging, finally, all the low-level goblins were outfitted with simple armor and shortswords. 
The big variants were fully armed. 
“Plus the monsters left in the Great Tomb can fight.” Lin Tian said. 
To say he wasn’t nervous was a lie. 
At this moment, goblin scouts sent from the front line reported back, “Boss, the Empire’s people have reached the Great Tomb, stopping 15 kilometers away.” 
15 kilometers away? 
Lin Tian pondered. It seemed there was a small plain at that distance. 
It looked like they intended to battle there. 
“I see. Keep scouting and report back.” Lin Tian gave the orders. 
He had Alice, who had experience leading troops, start assembling the soldiers, organizing the phalanx, and saying something to boost morale. 
“We are messengers of the gods, chosen for a holy war! We must slaughter all demons from this world! Those humans!” 
Hatred, coldness, and murderous intent began to burn in Alice’s eyes. 
Unfortunately, while her morale was high, the goblins remained unmoved. 
Lin Tian helplessly said, “Ahem, let me do it.” 
For goblins, boosting morale was simple. 
“Do you want an empire where you can do whatever you want? Follow me to kill those guys in silver armor, and you’ll have endless women and limitless food and drink!” 
In summary, it was as simple as that. 
The goblins instantly became excited! 
“I want to play with women! I’m tired of these monsters!” 
“Human wine is the best, I want to drink it!” 
“Blood and flesh, I want fresh and tender blood and flesh. Monsters don’t taste good!” 
“Build an empire! Conquer all races, I want to play with every race! Kehkehkeh!” 
The crazy clamor echoed throughout the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
Alice shrugged, helpless at the sight. 
Goblin Slayer couldn’t help but smile, “Goblins truly understand goblins.” 
Lin Tian chuckled, “Don’t lump me in with them. They’re too shallow. I aim to control divine power.” 
Over time, he deeply understood how much harm divine power brought to humans. 
A few words could brainwash a person. 
Even someone like Alice firmly believed in divine power. 
Only by becoming a god could he control everyone. Even those high and mighty would kneel before a god. 
Making them kneel without daring to sit. 
Next, Alice began instructing on matters to note in war. 
Lin Tian activated the Life Simulation System. 
Such a great war held many uncertainties and extremely powerful roles. 
A slight mistake could lead to death. 
With the system’s margin for error, he could better grasp victory. 
This was why he had forcibly stopped the Life Simulation before. Fortunately, he could simulate again before the war began. 
[The Life Simulation System is starting. Current scenario: Imperial War. 
Today marks the 300th day since you transmigrated to this world. Nearly a year, and you finally face the biggest turning point. 
The tribe is strong, with 80,000 low-level goblins, 30,000 big variants, 8,000 hero variants, and 100 leader variants, the strongest goblin tribe in history. 
You lead this massive army, beginning the attack. 
You also activate the Call skill, summoning all low-intelligence monsters from the Great Tomb.] 
A total of twenty thousand, with fewer than five hundred above the fifth tier, and only ten above the seventh tier. 
However, upon seeing the one hundred thousand fully armored soldiers of the Lionheart Empire, including thirty thousand heavy cavalry, pressure was felt. 
The war began amidst the hysterical shouts from both sides. 
The strength of the fully armored soldiers far exceeded expectations, with a casualty ratio of 5 to 1, the goblins dying far faster than anticipated. 
At this moment, Veronica appeared, using a super-tier skill to summon the Black Goat Spawn into the battle, which started to pull the casualty ratio back. 
But when the church members exerted their power, the situation reversed again. 
You were immediately targeted by the strong warriors of the Lionheart Empire and the church. 
Under the dense, powerful attacks, you had nowhere to escape. 
To save you, Gobu Kuang and the others all died in battle, and Alice was knocked unconscious and captured. 
You inevitably became a pawn for the Great Tomb. 
In the end, both sides suffered heavy losses… 
Summary: In a situation where the strong are numerous, exposing oneself is akin to falling into hell. 
Score: 40 points (out of 100) 
Reward: Life Points x40 
This life simulation ended, with a time progression of 1 day.] 
Abruptly. 
Lin Tian snapped back to reality, his face filled with fear, “Did I die that easily?” 
By now, he should have a combat level of at least 6,000, right? 
In the snowy plains, he also consumed many Snow Crystal Stones, reaching level ninety. 
However, thinking it through, he understood. The combat strength of the church members was uncertain. 
But from the performance of Bone King Veronica and the others, the old pope was likely close to a combat strength of 10,000. 
Still not an opponent Lin Tian could rival. 
Unless using Ruin Blood to greatly weaken him. 
But utilizing Ruin Blood was challenging and could only be done through ambush. 
“It seems I can’t expose myself first. I need Bone King to summon some monsters first.” Lin Tian pondered, every step now needed extreme caution. 
Otherwise, he would fall into hell. 
He first went to the legend formation to apply for a transmission message. 
Rebecca sensed it and opened the transmission channel to the Great Tomb for Lin Tian. 
Thus, he was transmitted. 
“We meet again. What’s the matter?” Rebecca forced a smile. 
Lin Tian looked around, seeing only Bone King, the Corpse Pope, and the seductive succubus. 
He quickly got to the point, “Things are serious. The Lionheart Empire and the church are camped 15 kilometers outside the Great Tomb.” 
“Oh?” 
Bone King Veronica reacted, “So, they intend to battle. How prepared are you?” 
“As you wished, the forces are almost ready, at the limit of what can be done. But compared to human fully armored soldiers, it’s still not enough. You need to strike first.” 
Lin Tian analyzed seriously. 
He had seen Veronica’s attribute panel before. 
[Veronica: Lv100<br/>

From the attributes, she wasn’t exceptionally strong. Lin Tian’s base attributes weren’t far behind hers. 
But her overall combat power was terrifying for one reason: her skills, profession, and equipment. 
Considering the system mentioned she later summoned the Black Goat’s egg. 
That’s the assumption. 
In the later stages, few relied solely on their attributes; skills, professions, racial talents, and equipment were crucial. 
Attributes had limits unless one belonged to divine or certain special races. 
Upon hearing this, Veronica didn’t speak first, but Rebecca questioned, “What are you saying? Our lady doesn’t strike so casually.” 
“Enough, this isn’t a trivial matter. Just release the captured heretics.” 
Veronica spoke, lightly stomping her staff. 
The four of them appeared above the teleportation array in the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
The bustling goblin army somewhat shocked Rebecca, but Veronica remained unfazed. 
She simply said, “You’ve done well. If you survive this great battle, you may follow and serve me.” 
“My lady!” Rebecca pouted, obviously resistant and even jealous. 
She showed Lin Tian a good face purely because Veronica intended to use him. 
Deep down, she harbored a strong aversion to goblins. 
Knowing this, Lin Tian never gave her a good face, avoiding being manipulated. 
“Thank you for the praise.” Lin Tian forced a smile, bowing his head, full of disdain. 
Thinking, what sort of trash? Serve you? Damn, I almost misheard. If you weren’t just a skeleton, I’d definitely take you down if given the chance! 
In this world, no woman was worth Lin Tian’s service. 
Only those he conquered. 
Thinking, even if you’re a skeleton, I’ll still make you submit. 
Otherwise, this show of superiority is pointless. 
Veronica gestured Rebecca to calm down and said, “You deserve it. Now, I’ll expand the army’s strength.” 
“Super-tier Magic · Heretical Summoning!” 
Immediately, two magic circles ten meters wide unfolded in the forest beside the goblin army! 
And several differently colored magic circles overlapped in the sky. 
Exuding extremely powerful magical energy. 
The wind howled, as if demons were whispering. 
Suddenly, a creepy, eerie laugh came from the magic circles, like impish chuckling. 
Two pitch-black heretical creatures slowly emerged from the magic circles. 
Each over ten meters tall, covered in writhing tentacles, lacking eyes, ears, or arms. 
Only three hoofed feet and a huge mouth. 
They even looked like bizarre oozing gold.

The Black Goat Spawn has a very similar name as the Dark Young from Overlord in Japanese. The Overlord translators didn’t translate it literally, and chose their own name for thematic purposes I guess. Evil God’s Black Goat Spawn: https://overlordmaruyama.fandom.com/wiki/Dark_Young
