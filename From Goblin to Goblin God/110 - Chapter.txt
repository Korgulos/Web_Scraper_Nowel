Chapter 110: Eden Will Avenge You! 
TL: Sungmin 
“I will transform into holy wrath and burn all the monsters to ashes!!!” 
The cardinal’s eyes were filled with pain, his entire body ablaze with holy fire. 
Enduring the excruciating pain, he delivered a powerful punch! 
He sent Rebecca flying dozens of meters away, her body ignited by the holy fire. 
Her clothes were burnt and tattered. 
The goblins and imperial soldiers who had been fighting just a second ago stopped in their tracks, collapsing to the ground in ecstasy. 
The effect of this was too widespread. 
Large groups of soldiers and monsters were entranced, losing themselves completely. 
The cardinal initially intended to eliminate him first, but seeing the effect, he thought it could relieve some pressure on the battlefield. 
It might prevent the soldiers from being massacred by the monsters. 
Thus, he set his sights on Alice instead. 
The holy fire did not affect Alice, but it significantly suppressed the power of the Ominous Blade. 
Now, it was as if she held an ordinary piece of iron, perhaps even less. 
Her attacks were ineffective against the cardinal. 
“I’m sorry, I couldn’t save you!” 
The cardinal, in anguish, sent Alice flying into the air with a few punches. 
He then activated a magic circle, “Super-tier Magic · Heavenly Fire Judgement…” 
This strike was enough to kill her, or at the very least, severely injure her. 
Alice, weightless in the high air, had no means of dodging. 
In the distance, Rebecca realized, “Damn! Are the church people so heartless? Even killing humans?” 
She couldn’t bear to see Alice die. 
She admired Alice the most, for both her strength and beauty, and their recent fight side by side. 
She had even fallen in love with her. 
One must understand, her relationship with Veronica was not just superior and subordinate. 
There was also a romantic aspect. 
The cardinal, however, did not hesitate at all. He didn’t have much time left and wanted to take down as many powerful enemies as possible before his death. 
“Roar!” 
Suddenly, a lion’s roar echoed. Charles II, with tears in his eyes, shouted, “Alice!!!” 
He knew well that the Lionheart Empire’s days were numbered, and resistance was futile. It was better to protect the one who always protected them before dying. 
He leaped into the air, using his flesh and blood to block the Heavenly Fire Judgement. 
The terrifying fireball instantly blew Charles II into pieces! 
He still had many things to say to Alice, but there was no chance now. 
The imperial soldiers, seeing this, were horrified, unable to accept it. 
“Your Majesty!!” 
The cardinal’s heart skipped a beat! 
He hadn’t anticipated this outcome! 
Behind the burning debris, Alice’s eyes were filled with hatred and remorse. 
She hated those who wanted her dead, but she didn’t hate Charles II. 
She even saw him as a father figure. 
And now, he died tragically before her eyes. 
“Why did it turn out like this? How many more mistakes do I have to make!” 
The cardinal knelt on the ground in agony, shouting in despair. 
Looking at his hands, he was filled with regret. 
Suddenly, he felt a chill down his back, sensing a strong threat approaching! 
Alice transformed once more into the Dark Ruler, with dragon wings sprouting from her back! 
She exuded an aura of supreme dominance! 
This time, she completely controlled the powers of the Dark Ruler and the dragon. 
“Tsk tsk tsk, things are getting interesting,” the Dark Ruler remarked. 
The cardinal, though filled with regret, knew he couldn’t die yet. He had to do something more. 
He threw out two more Heavenly Fire Judgements. 
“Swoosh swoosh swoosh!” 
But they were dispersed by a powerful Sword Qi, accompanied by a dragon’s roar. 
As the flames scattered, a sword appeared at the cardinal’s neck. 
Unable to react in time, his throat was slit, blood spurting out. 
“Damn, is my time up? I couldn’t dodge in time…” 
The cardinal muttered in surprise, not caring about his wound. 
He was about to die anyway. 
He raised his hand to cast another super-tier spell. 
“Slash!” 
A blade flashed. 
Both his arms fell to the ground with a thud! 
The cardinal gritted his teeth in pain, “How could this be! You…!” 
Before he could finish, a dagger pierced through his cheeks, silencing him. 
Then, his legs were cut off. 
He looked like a horrifying, inhuman creature. 
Alice, resembling a demon, stood before the cardinal, blood dripping from her sword. 
She lowered her head, her face darkened with lines of black. 
She neither spoke nor attacked. 
She just watched him die in agony, moment by moment. 
“Our emperor, our emperor is dead, killed by the church!!!” 
“Why, why, why!” 
“Lionheart in its twilight years. Farewell, Your Majesty. I will join you soon!” 
The news spread quickly among the imperial soldiers, their faces filled with grief and anger! 
In no time, they turned their fury towards the clergy, even if it meant killing them by mistake; they could not accept this! 
Charles II might not have been a powerful king, but he was certainly a worthy one!  
Great and selfless! 
How could they not hate the ones who killed him? 
At this moment, the monsters began a full-on assault! 
They forced the empire and church forces to retreat continuously until there was nowhere left to go! 
The cardinal’s mouth moved, blood constantly pouring out, but he insisted on speaking, “Alice, I didn’t mean to, forgive me! Forgive me!” 
Despite the dagger tearing his mouth apart, he begged earnestly. 
However, he could only die with regret. 
“Slash!” 
A flash of the blade. 
Head and body separated! 
Alice stood before the corpse, seemingly mourning Charles II. 
Her heart was now dead. 
Not intentional? Chasing her for so long, if it wasn’t intentional, what was it? 
Thus, her hatred for the church, the kingdom, and the imperial citizens reached its peak. 
Now, even Charles II had died because of those people. 
This only strengthened her resolve. 
“Are you Alice? Don’t worry, we will always be with you.” 
Rebecca slowly walked over at this moment. 
Her voluptuous body pressed closely against Alice. 
Trying to comfort her, this was the first step in forming a connection. 
As a succubus, she was actually a lesbian who had never done the typical succubus activities. 
In a sense, she was a disgrace to succubi. 
But Alice did not buy it, and instead, she coldly said, “Gobu Kuang, take the remaining hero variants and follow me. It’s time to occupy the capital!” 
She could not wait to trouble the capital’s residents. 
To make them pay for their sins. 
“Cerberus, you go along too. This battlefield is no longer a battlefield.” Rebecca instructed. 
She sent a group of monsters to follow Alice to the capital. 
Only then could it be proven that the Great Tomb had defeated the Lionheart Empire and the church. 
What remained were the imperial soldiers running in panic; their main forces were all dead, even the king. 
The church was also covering the retreat of the Holy Mother. 
This battle was unbearably tragic. 
Mainly with heavy casualties on the empire and church sides. 
At this moment, Veronica and the old Pope were still fighting in the dark realm. 
A burst of intense holy light exploded above the clouds! 
It forced all the monsters chasing the imperial soldiers to retreat. 
The old Pope returned to this world amidst the light, now radiating power beyond human capabilities. 
His eyes shone with golden light, holding a greatsword formed of light. 
Veronica smirked, “Already pushed to this point after such a short time?” 
The old Pope had used his last trump card, a world-class spell, Heavenly Descent. 
He established a link with the twelve-winged seraph Gabriel. 
Merging a trace of her consciousness and power within him, essentially inviting a deity. 
But it consumed all of the old Pope’s remaining strength. 
However, it was enough to kill Veronica. 
“Monster, are you ready to face judgment? Under my divine might, no heretic dares appear; you can’t summon anything!” 
A mature, authoritative female voice came from the old Pope’s mouth. 
Like thunder from the ninth heaven! 
The other monsters trembled in fear, curling up on the ground! 
They felt that standing up would be disrespectful and could lead to death at any moment. 
Veronica felt immense pressure but remained confident, “Douglas, is this your final trump card? Well, let me match it!” 
Saying this, she also began a heretical summoning. 
“It’s useless!” 
Gabriel sneered, raising the Sword of Judgment to strike. 
Suddenly, her expression changed, she withdrew her sword and retreated. 
Cautiously, she said, “Traitor of Eden, what does this have to do with you? Are you also getting involved?” 
“Kehehe~ I wasn’t interested, but they said it involved you, so why not come?” 
From Veronica’s body, the same aura as Gabriel’s burst forth. 
Her voice changed, sounding like a mad woman. 
It was the fallen angel Lucifer. 
Also a twelve-winged seraph. 
Unlike the old Pope’s invocation of Gabriel, Veronica had anticipated this. 
It didn’t require much effort. 
Lucifer willingly descended, because she hated angels and Eden. 
These two auras pressured both monsters and humans to the ground! 
Trembling, they dared not move. 
Gabriel was furious, “You traitor, why do you always oppose us!” 
“Because you framed me! I swore I would return to Eden and make you all beg at my feet!” Lucifer said angrily. 
At this moment, Gabriel was silent. 
She knew she was not a match for Lucifer, and the old Pope’s body couldn’t endure much more. 
Instead, she looked at the crowd, “People, Eden will never forget your suffering today! The Great Tomb, goblins, we will deal with you!” 
With that, the holy light from the heavens seemed severed. 
The old Pope also recovered, stumbling and nearly falling. 
He had killed several heretics in the dark realm, heavily injured, and establishing a link with Eden had exhausted his strength. 
The Holy Mother rushed to support him. 
“Quick, go to the Sword Kingdom, the holy light there never extinguishes. There’s also the Clover Kingdom and the Shamrock Kingdom, their churches can shelter you…” 
The old Pope spoke with difficulty, each word seeming to take his last breath. 
Finally, he closed his eyes, revealing ordinary brown pupils. 
In the end, he was once just an ordinary person, merely burdened with responsibility. 
… 
Shamrocks are 3-leafed clovers.
