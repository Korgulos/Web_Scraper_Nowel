Chapter 27: Naming, Gobu Shan 
TL: Sungmin 
Then, he rode the dragon and returned first. 
“Hmm?” 
Kasimov looked up into the distance, sensing something pass by, but saw nothing. 
Lin Tian flew at low altitude to avoid being exposed. 
Upon returning to the tribe, he started thinking of ways to capture that guy. Level 60, not weak at all, and a big bundle of experience. 
If he devoured him, he’d be one step closer to cultivating a new hero variant. 
“Do you know a man named Kasimov? He’s here, coming to die.” Lin Tian walked up to Loder and said. 
Upon hearing this, Loder was overjoyed, “Hahaha! I didn’t expect him to come too! Finally, we are saved! You will all die! He is someone who has taken down several Titan Warriors alone!” 
“What are Titan Warriors?” 
Lin Tian asked in confusion. 
Loder did not hold back and explained, “They are special warriors cultivated by an enemy nation using Titan genes. Their physical qualities are extremely strong, capable of tearing apart fifth-tier monsters with their bare hands.” 
“In that case, Kasimov indeed has some skills.” 
Lin Tian pondered. He couldn’t fall into that guy’s hands and had to minimize casualties. 
Ideally, zero casualties. 
Every goblin in this tribe had been painstakingly nurtured. 
Loder kept laughing proudly on the side, incessantly saying that they were all doomed and would all die. 
Lin Tian suddenly looked at him coldly, “You, I don’t even know how to deal with you right now.” 
At this moment, sending the goblins to deal with him would actually delight him. 
Physical torture, he was already numb to it, barely feeling any pain. 
Suddenly, Lin Tian thought of a way to handle Kasimov. “Ifreya, crawl here.” 
“Master, my noble lord, what do you need Ifreya to do?” 
Ifreya quickly ran over like a dog, sticking out her pink tongue. 
Loder’s voice abruptly stopped. 
Lin Tian commanded, “Later, I need you to…” 
“You dare! Ifreya! Don’t listen to that beast! You are one of us humans, you are the Saintess of the Holy Order! Don’t associate with those damn goblins!” 
Loder shouted in despair, defeated again! 
His hopes were repeatedly crushed by Lin Tian! 
Then. 
Ifreya stood up, put on tattered clothes, and made herself filthy. 
If she still looked like a normal person, it would definitely arouse suspicion. 
Then she was sent to walk towards the enchanted forest. 
Lin Tian called Gobu Tian, “Come with me, there’s something to do.” 
… 
“It seems true, the entire enchanted forest is devoid of monsters, very unusual.” 
Kasimov scanned the surroundings and said. 
Finally, he saw the place where the Silver Blade Captain and others had fought last night, with obvious battle marks. 
“Getting closer.” 
He quickly accelerated, riding his horse at full speed. 
At that moment, a person suddenly appeared in front of him, and the face seemed somewhat familiar. 
“Help! Help me, Kasimov!” 
It was Ifreya. Seeing him, she immediately ran over. 
Kasimov dismounted swiftly, “You are, the white-robed nun Ifreya? You didn’t die! Where is Lord Loder?” 
“He is dead. Take me away from here quickly, I need to return to the Order, boohoo!” 
Ifreya threw herself into Kasimov’s arms, crying. 
Seeing her appearance and reaction, he couldn’t imagine what horrific things she had endured with the goblins. 
Especially since she was a sacred nun, chosen as a servant of God, but now… 
Kasimov quickly comforted her, “Stay here and don’t move. I’ll go check the situation. If I don’t return for a long time, just run straight ahead.” 
“Okay, please hurry.” Ifreya pleaded. 
As Kasimov turned around, a holy light suddenly shone! 
“Holy Bible Cage!” 
In an instant, he was trapped in a crucifix! 
Seeing this, Kasimov was shocked, “Nun, what are you doing?!” 
“Holy Light Impact!” 
It wasn’t over yet. Ifreya attacked again. 
Kasimov immediately reacted, “Mid-tier · Death Roar! Roar!” 
A mournful wail like that of a hell demon echoed! 
It shattered the crucifix confining him. 
However, he couldn’t avoid the holy light. He immediately drew his longsword to block it. 
Unexpectedly, such a powerful attack only pushed him back four or five meters and was completely blocked. 
“White-robed nun, do you know what you’re doing?” Kasimov said, eyes filled with fury. 
However, Ifreya had no intention of stopping, continuously attacking. 
This was Lin Tian’s order. 
Sustained attacks to exhaust Kasimov’s strength. 
They also ambushed from behind. 
While the two fought fiercely, a figure quietly approached. 
Even though it was daytime, Gobu Tian’s Dark Blessing didn’t work, preventing him from becoming invisible, but his speed was still incredible. 
Suddenly, he struck! 
“Clang!” 
The sharp claws made a metallic collision sound but failed to pierce through, leaving only a crack. 
Kasimov reacted immediately, “What the hell is this? Death Roar!!!” 
This skill not only dispelled control but also stunned enemies, rendering them immobile. 
He was serious now! 
The ear-piercing roar paralyzed Gobu Tian, and the longsword was about to fall on his head. 
A burning arrow suddenly flew from nowhere, forcing Kasimov to retreat. 
In the brief moment, Gobu Tian quickly escaped. 
With his incredible speed and small size, he darted through the grass, making it hard to locate him. 
“Someone else is hiding? No, it must be a monster. Ifreya! As a nun of the Holy Order, why are you colluding with monsters?” 
Kasimov angrily glared at her. 
However, there was no response, only continuous attacks. 
“It seems I have to get rough with you!” 
Then, he ignited a black flame in his left hand, casting a high-tier spell, Grim Reaper’s Harvest! 
It could seize souls, causing them to pass out. 
Lin Tian watched from afar, sensing something was wrong. If this continued, Ifreya would be taken away. 
He would rather let her die than be captured. 
Controlling the Elemental Hand Crossbow, he launched an attack! 
“Clang, clang, clang!” 
However, it was blocked by iron armor again. 
“This armor seems quite valuable, it’s incredibly resistant.” Lin Tian commented. 
Kasimov coldly stared in the direction the arrows came from, “Stop hiding! What kind of monster are you? Come out now!” 
“Heh heh heh, it seems you are indeed more troublesome than those guys last night.” 
Finally, Lin Tian slowly walked out of the bushes. 
Seeing it was a Small Goblin, Kasimov was still extremely shocked, “How can a low-level Goblin like you…?” 
He realized this Goblin tribe was terrifying! 
A Small Goblin was so strong and intelligent! 
And that black creature hiding in the bushes was likely a special variant of Goblin too. 
The situation was too dangerous! 
He had to leave quickly with the white-robed nun. 
Kasimov steeled himself, “Let’s end this quickly!” 
Suddenly, he charged! Moving first!! 
But Lin Tian stood still, not intending to dodge. 
“You’re dead!” 
Kasimov couldn’t imagine how Lin Tian could evade. It was too late to use any skill. 
The cold black blade was just centimeters from piercing Lin Tian’s heart. 
But suddenly! 
Kasimov felt dizzy and confused. 
His hands were empty, not knowing what to do. 
His longsword appeared in Lin Tian’s hands. 
“Not bad, this sword. I’ll give it to Gobu Kuang.” 
Lin Tian examined it, then threw it dozens of meters away, embedding it into a tree trunk. 
Kasimov’s heart pounded, his expression worse than if he had eaten shit, “Impossible! What happened? My sword! How did it get into your hands?!” 
This was Lin Tian’s skill, ‘No-Blade Capture.’ 
When activated once, it could be used three times consecutively to withstand three physical attacks. 
If used all at once, it had a chance to seize the opponent’s weapon. 
Depending on the opponent’s strength. 
“Your strength is formidable, but unfortunately, you’re too arrogant.” 
As Lin Tian finished speaking, Ifreya’s Holy Bible Cage skill became usable again, trapping Kasimov directly. 
Then he let Gobu Tian take action. 
“Slash!” 
This time, he shattered Kasimov’s armor with one strike. 
Lin Tian had been continuously attacking the cracks in his armor, causing them to widen and break more easily. 
Blood flowed down Kasimov’s back. 
Kasimov started to panic, “When did that monster get behind me again, or was it always there? No matter what, was I always destined to lose?” 
Now he understood that even if the sword hadn’t been seized, the black creature would have ambushed him. 
Covering his wound, Kasimov retreated repeatedly. 
Severely injured and weaponless, he knew his end was near. 
After being savagely torn by Gobu Tian, he completely lost the ability to resist. 
“Facing just two Goblins, I am no match. What kind of terrifying existence is this tribe?! Leader, I am coming to meet you…” 
Kasimov finished and fell into a pool of blood. 
Lin Tian smiled coldly, pleased. Finally, the matter was resolved. Fortunately, these guys came one by one like the Calabash Brothers rescuing their grandpa. 
If they had come together, it would have been tough to handle. 
However, under his open scheme, they had no choice. 
Otherwise, it would have been a wasted trip to find the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother. 
Looking at Ifreya in the distance, Lin Tian said, “Well done, I will reward you well.” 
This time, she had indeed played a role. 
Ifreya hopped over on all fours. 
Pulling at Lin Tian’s ragged clothes, “Noble master, I want my reward now. I am already your slave, let me serve you.” 
“Go away, we’ll talk later.” 
Lin Tian impatiently kicked her fair and tender face. 
Then he retrieved the black longsword and had Gobu Tian drag the corpse back to the tribe. 
When Kasimov’s body was thrown in the middle of the tribe, the Goblins cheered again. 
Loder’s face was filled with disbelief, “Another one dead! That Sword Saintess bitch! Why hasn’t she come yet for those damned Bright Town riffraff?!” 
“Oh? Is this how you slander your master? I think she’s quite great, very righteous.” Lin Tian said, scrutinizing him. 
Then he had the previous Goblin come to devour the corpse. 
It leveled up to 49, almost evolving into a hero variant. 
And received the name from Lin Tian, ‘Gobu Shan.’ 
This guy was quite docile, considered kind in this Goblin tribe. 
Encountering flowers, grass, or small insects, he wouldn’t crush them but play with them instead. 
Usually, he preferred to be alone. 
However, he wasn’t truly kind. 
He was a truly dark, evil, and even perverted Goblin! 
Catching prey, he would torment it to death bit by bit. With small insects, he enjoyed making them fight to the death, watching them kill each other. 
Then he ate them all. 
Lin Tian wanted to see if he would mutate into a rare existence if he evolved into a hero variant. 
“Gobu Shan? Thank you, boss! Thank you, boss! I have a name now!” 
Gobu Shan danced with joy, celebrating. 
… 
“At this moment, sending the goblins to deal with him would actually delight him.” Omg…
