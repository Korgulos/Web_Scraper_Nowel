Chapter 206: Heading to the Zerg Empire! 
TL: Sungmin  
As the grand army set off in full force, Lin Tian turned around, gazing in the direction of the Free Empire. 
His eyes were full of amusement. 
However, he also took a glance at the barren, somewhat desolate Holy Tree. 
There seemed to be an issue with this tree’s stance. 
He wasn’t sure if it would pledge allegiance to him or remain loyal to the original Holy Tree Empire. 
Or perhaps it would maintain an independent stance. 
If it harbored any hostility towards him, he wouldn’t allow it to live. 
“Goblin! I will never forgive you! I will avenge Sister Luna and the Holy Tree Empire!” 
Suddenly. 
The illusion of a tree spirit, which he had seen earlier, appeared, spitting out a hateful threat. 
But it was obvious that it had grown extremely weak. 
Lin Tian sneered, “It seems you really have no intention of living, huh?” 
No wonder people say that it’s just a little tree with low intelligence. 
“I am a branch of the World Tree. Even if the apocalypse comes and the seas dry up, I will not die!” 
The tree spirit spoke proudly, recalling the earlier humiliation and growing even more resentful. 
But Lin Tian reveled in the feeling of being hated yet completely untouchable. “Are you provoking me?” he said as he slowly approached the tree. 
“What are you going to do?”  
The tree spirit looked astonished. 
Immediately, Lin Tian relieved himself, letting off a fresh stream of Longjing tea. 
The sound of water was continuous and intense, carving a large hole into the ground. 
“Ugh! Stop it, stop it! Goblin, you are shameless and despicable!!!” 
The tree spirit cursed furiously, but it couldn’t stop the nausea and revulsion. 
Because it was absorbing the moisture. 
This kind of humiliation had never been experienced in thousands of years. After all, it was a god! 
A god worshipped by millions of citizens of the Holy Tree Empire. 
It was the first time it had suffered such disgrace. 
Lin Tian raised an eyebrow, looking up at the tree. “How does it taste? Pretty good, right?” 
After careful consideration. 
There was no need to keep this Holy Tree around. 
Although it was miraculous, capable of breeding a million goblins at once, it posed a huge risk if it regained its power without a means of control. 
The aftermath would be disastrous. 
Mainly because it lacked intelligence. It was impossible to reason or cooperate with it. 
Besides, army numbers were no longer the key to victory. 
What was needed now was to develop top-tier combat strength, like Alice, Gobu Yue, and Gobu Kuang. 
Including himself. 
If the upper ranks were wiped out, no matter how many soldiers there were, they would still be scattered like sand. 
“Shh…” 
Lin Tian extended his sharp black nails, slashing open the palm of his left hand. 
The pitch-black decaying blood slowly dripped down. 
The moment it touched the soil, black smoke rose continuously! 
The blood seeped into the ground, absorbed by the Holy Tree’s roots. 
The tree spirit let out a pained cry, its form growing more and more insubstantial, eventually fading away. 
Just before that. 
Lin Tian almost forgot. “Lucky Steal!” 
He hurriedly cast the magic, eager to see if he could snatch something from the Holy Tree. 
His expectations were high. 
After all, he couldn’t think of what he might steal from a tree—what could it possibly cherish the most? 
‘Congratulations to the host, you have obtained: Holy Tree Seed x1!’ 
A seed? 
Looking at the black seed, about the size of an apple, in his hand. 
Lin Tian couldn’t immediately think of any use for it. Planting it and waiting for it to grow would surely take many years. 
He simply stored it in his spatial ring for now. 
Since the tree was so massive, he had to bleed almost to the point of collapse before the Holy Tree finally withered. 
After all, it was just a sapling, nothing compared to the World Tree. 
It was only two or three thousand meters tall. 
The World Tree could cover the entire skyline, truly enormous. 
Looking at the now-ruined and worthless Holy Tree Empire. 
Lin Tian muttered to himself, “Whatever. Cutting off the Free Empire’s connection to the outside world is enough.” 
The rest could be dealt with by looting the empire’s valuable resources. 
Like food, minerals, and so on. 
Most of the people were already gone, and he couldn’t be bothered with the remaining refugees. 
The other small cities could easily be taken by Alice and the others when the time came. 
Then. 
He devoured all the high-level corpses on the ground. 
Especially the giant elephant and the Holy Tree King. 
Finally, he reached level 105, now able to instantly kill anything below level 99!

“It seems it’s time to go to the Zerg Empire and find someone to help.” Lin Tian said. 
Just in time, the Ant Tribe had invited him multiple times to visit, so there was no harm in making the trip. 
Lin Tian was also curious to see what the top-tier empire of the monster world was like. 
After explaining the situation to Gobu Yue, he set off alone toward the Zerg Empire. 
The journey was long—about 5,000 kilometers, according to that ant person from before. 
So, he directly used the Life Simulation System to skip the tedious travel time. 
However, the simulation was forcibly interrupted upon his arrival at the Zerg Empire. 
If everything was skipped, what was the point of him going? His curiosity drove him to see what the Zerg Empire was like. 
To experience the culture of other monster empires. 
‘Life Simulation completed, earned 10 Life Points.’ 
‘Do you want to cross over to the current plot: Arrival at the Zerg Empire?’ 
“Cross over.” 
As soon as Lin Tian finished speaking, he found himself standing on a highland. 
Stunned… 
The scene before him was like someone had shoved a giant painting directly into his eyes! 
Below the highland lay a vast, endless plain. 
On the plain were several enormous cities combined together! 
They were unprecedentedly massive! 
The horizon seemed to stretch on forever, and he had to turn around to see the edge on the other side. 
There were no city walls, just densely packed, bizarre buildings of all kinds. 
The sight was overwhelming. 
The buildings were all in shades of black and purple, strange and enchanting. 
There were also many giant sculptures. 
What struck him the most was a city of golden sand dunes, standing out prominently among the group of cities. 
The stark contrast between the golden yellow and dark purple was striking. 
It was clear that this was the city of the Ant Tribe. 
Surrounding it were all kinds of disorganized insectoid creatures, as the Zerg Empire was composed of many insect species. 
The Zerg Empire wasn’t built by just one or a few types of insects. 
It was centered around the Demon Zerg Queen, the royal family. 
She led thousands of different insect species to form this empire. 
The Ant Tribe, the Phantom Worm Tribe, the Scorpion Men, the Devil Locusts, and others were merely subordinates. 
They were equivalent to nobility. 
The empire was massive. 
Even Lin Tian was awestruck. “There must be at least a billion insects here. No wonder it’s called the top Zerg Empire… Who would dare provoke them? They’d be facing the entire Zerg swarm.” 
After calming down, he began walking toward the main gate. 
As he got closer, he realized that the empire didn’t just consist of Zerg species. There were also many other humanoid monsters. 
For example, there were Pigmen, Minotaurs, and so on. 
But Lin Tian was aware of one rule here. 
Insects were the upper-class race, and all others were inferior. 
That’s why many monsters would rather live in the Goblin Empire than come here. 
From a distance. 
Lin Tian saw two insect soldiers standing guard—creatures resembling locusts but about as tall as humans. 
They stood there on duty. 
Every humanoid monster entering the city casually handed them a silver coin, a tradition as old as time. 
Lin Tian, not having such small currency, lined up and pulled out two gold coins. 
“Hurry up! I’m so sick of collecting these small amounts all day!” one of the locust soldiers grumbled. 
“Haha, even mosquito legs are meat. Just endure it,” the other teased. 
“Keep it down, or the Mosquito Tribe might hear you and come suck your blood tonight!” 
They joked with each other. 
Suddenly. 
Their eyes were dazzled by the golden gleam in front of them. 
Gold! 
Gold coins! 
Without hesitation, they snatched the coins from Lin Tian’s hand, too excited to contain themselves. “Oh my god, this idiot actually gave us gold coins!!!” 
“We’ve struck it rich, brother!” 
Upon hearing this. 
Lin Tian’s eye twitched slightly. Did they just call him an idiot? 
He was about to turn around and kill them both. 
But they spoke first. “Wait a minute! You’re a goblin?” 
Lin Tian’s expression turned cold. “Is there a problem?” 
“Problem? Get lost! The Zerg Empire doesn’t welcome low-level monsters like you!” 
One of the locust soldiers cursed, raising a thorn-covered hand as if to strike. 
Even the other monsters in line grew impatient. “What’s a goblin doing here?” 
One of them reached out to grab Lin Tian, intending to toss him out. 
But the locust soldier quickly realized something was wrong. 
Despite using all his strength, he couldn’t move this goblin an inch. 
Seeing this. 
The other locust sneered, “A goblin, and you’re wasting time? Just kill him. He’s probably got more gold coins on him!” 
With that, he raised his powerful leg! 
Their feet were equipped with sharp claws, easily capable of piercing flesh. 
One kick could impale a goblin like a boot piercing through leather. 
“High-Speed Kick!” 
The locust soldier kicked fiercely toward Lin Tian! 
But all that was heard was a crisp crack! 
The exoskeleton of the locust shattered completely! 
Green liquid sprayed everywhere! 
Lin Tian’s Life Armor easily blocked the incoming kick; in fact, even if the blow had landed, he wouldn’t have felt a thing. 
Their combat power wasn’t even 4,000—pitifully low. 
“Crack!” 
Suddenly, another snap echoed. 
Lin Tian had crushed the arm of the locust soldier who had grabbed him. 
“Ahh! It hurts! You damned goblin, how dare you cause trouble on Zerg territory! I… I’ll tear you to pieces!” the locust soldier cursed venomously. 
The next second. 
Lin Tian casually crushed his head.  
“Splat!” 
Sticky green fluid splattered everywhere. 
The surrounding humanoid monsters were terrified, retreating several steps in shock! 
Lin Tian grabbed a handful of the splattered bits, mixed with green ooze, and began chewing. Spitting it out, he sneered, “Tastes awful. A lowly green locust dares to threaten me?” 
In the Locust Tribe, green locusts were the lowest caste. 
Even though he was here to ask for help from the Locust Tribe, he wasn’t worried about offending them. 
After all, the Ant Queen was backing him now. 
Lin Tian then approached the fallen locust soldier. “Does it hurt?” 
“It hurts so much! Help! Someone, please, heal my leg!” The pain was excruciating, like knives cutting through every nerve in his body. He felt like he was on the verge of passing out! 
Lin Tian grinned darkly, “Heh, heh. I know a method to relieve the pain. Want to try it?” 
Upon hearing this, the locust soldier, delirious from the agony, desperately nodded. “Yes, yes! Anything, just save me!” 
“Crack, crack, crack!” 
In an instant, a series of shattering sounds echoed! 
The green locust’s eyes bulged, bloodshot, and his mouth spewed red-green blood as his body convulsed violently. 
He couldn’t even utter a single word. 
“Doesn’t hurt anymore, does it?” Lin Tian asked coldly, grinning. 
The method? 
He had simply crushed the soldier completely. 
When pain reaches a certain threshold, the nerves shut down, effectively numbing the body.
