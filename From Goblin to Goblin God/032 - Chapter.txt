Chapter 32: Mutant Goblin! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Thank you on their behalf. Do you hear, children? If you’re leaving, leave quickly.” 
Lia was overjoyed and hurriedly gave instructions. 
Cassandra was momentarily confused. “Mother dear? Why are you staying behind? Let’s leave together. We can rebuild our home!” 
“Cassandra, child, I find Lin Tian quite good, so…” 
Lia spoke softly and gently, her face full of apology. 
Seeing her so resolute, Cassandra cried and hugged her. “If Mother dear isn’t leaving, then I won’t leave either!” 
“We’ll all stay, only willing to follow Mother dear!” 
“That’s right. The Myriad Forms Forest is gone; our home has long been lost!” 
The remaining elves also chose to stay, though a few decided to leave and quickly disappeared into the forest. 
Lia never expected that so many would stay. “Alright, children, from now on, you will not follow me but Lin Tian, this Goblin leader!” 
The group of elves hesitated for a moment before kneeling before Lin Tian. 
“Rest assured, since you are no longer my captives but my subordinates, I will ensure your safety. If anyone dares to touch you without consent, tell me, and I’ll kill them!” 
Lin Tian raised his voice intentionally, speaking to the other goblins. 
This reassured the elves. 
Then he had Gobu Yue help choose a place to build shelters; they couldn’t live in cages anymore. 
This scene left Loder with his mouth wide open, unable to believe it was real! 
“Elves? Elves joined the goblin tribe! Hahaha! This isn’t real!” 
Cassandra and Gobu Yue got along well, so they were quite harmonious together. 
Soon, they chose a place to live, but the elves still preferred to live in trees, only building simple wooden houses. 
Lin Tian instructed, “Lia, tell Gobu Yue if you need anything. Gobu Yue will arrange for other goblins to collect it.” 
“I understand, Boss. Thank you. Although we’ve had unpleasant times, everything will pass.” Lia said affectionately. 
Over these days, she had been drawn to Lin Tian’s personality and even more to his powerful mating ability. 
She couldn’t understand why a goblin would have such strong charisma. 
Staying behind to slowly explore wasn’t a bad option either. 
After setting aside the elves’ matters. 
Lin Tian focused on the newly captured humans. Their value was far less than the elves’. 
They were just simple breeding machines. 
“Gobu Kuang, Gobu Tian, it’s up to you now. Breed all these humans.” Lin Tian said. 
During the time when the Sword Saintess was weakened, it was the best golden development period. They had to cultivate hero variants and third-generation goblins in large numbers! 
Otherwise, it would be troublesome when reinforcements arrived later. 
Gobu Kuang grabbed a human. “Boss, this human is too small for me right now.” 
“Hmm, it seems so. Then artificial breeding it is, but it will still be tough on you.” Lin Tian shrugged. 
However, this time artificial breeding was much easier because the elves had experience and could help. 
“No, no! Get this disgusting thing away from me!” 
“Elf sister, please spare me. I don’t want to carry a goblin’s child!” 
“Mommy, why is this goblin on top of me?” 
After some simple screams, Lin Tian went to find Gobu Shan, that rascal. Despite spending so many resources and experience, he hadn’t evolved? 
If he didn’t slaughter him to feed others, he couldn’t justify it to himself. 
While looking for him, he found Gobu Shan hiding in a corner, constantly scratching his body, even tearing off large chunks of skin. 
It was a bit creepy. 
Lin Tian sternly questioned, “Gobu Shan, what are you doing?” 
“Boss? I…I feel really itchy, like something wants to come out!” 
As he spoke, Gobu Shan kept scratching. 
He scratched faster and faster! 
Until he was rolling on the ground! 
His flesh became a bloody mess from scratching, and the situation spiraled out of control. 
Lin Tian quickly went over and pinned him down, “Stop it! If you keep scratching, you’ll kill yourself!” 
“Boss, let go, I feel terrible!” 
Gobu Shan struggled continuously, but he was much weaker than Lin Tian. 
Seeing him like this, Lin Tian didn’t stop him. If he died, he died. Perhaps, there was a twist? 
The sound of nails scraping flesh grew louder, and sticky, disgusting blood flowed everywhere from Gobu Shan’s body. 
Finally, Gobu Shan scratched himself to death. 
He twitched a few times on the ground, then stopped moving. 
“Did the evolution fail? How unlucky to encounter such a small probability.” Lin Tian sighed. 
In principle, goblins evolving into hero variants should almost always succeed if their aptitude was good. Just like the second-generation Gobu Tian, who evolved very quickly and directly. 
Just as they were about to drag his corpse away to feed it to the higher-level goblins, the body suddenly reacted! 
“Crack, crack, crack!” 
The sound of bones growing echoed, and they could see Gobu Shan’s small body starting to grow larger! 
It grew to be about the size of a big goblin, approximately 1.67 meters tall. 
Surprisingly, a row of sharp bone spikes protruded from his back, and there were spikes on his shoulders and elbows as well. 
There were also spikes around his thighs. 
His chest had horizontally growing bones, almost as if his ribs were growing outside his skin. 
Additionally, a long segmented bony tail grew out, at least three meters long! 
It looked like a natural armor, quite impressive. 
Next, the bloody and mangled body started to heal, and finally, the transformation was complete. 
He wasn’t particularly robust; his body appeared slender and sinewy, somewhat elongated. 
His arms and legs were relatively long. 
The skin was still green like that of a goblin. 
Lin Tian quickly checked this guy’s attributes. 
[Gobu Shan: Lv50<br/>

“What the hell? This guy actually has such high overall combat power?! If I hadn’t gained more attributes from mating with the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, I might not have been able to beat him!” 
Lin Tian exclaimed in surprise. 
Gobu Shan stood still, curiously admiring his transformation, not speaking but exuding an aura of strength! 
It was as if the words “can fight” were written all over his face. 
Lin Tian roughly guessed what had happened. He hadn’t evolved into a hero variant. 
Instead, he had mutated into a mutant variant! 
A berserk goblin! 
“Boss! I didn’t die! And I’ve become really strong! Hahaha!” 
Gobu Shan joyfully danced around. 
The nature of this goblin hadn’t changed. He swung his arms and tapped his feet in joy, almost as if he were dancing. 
Lin Tian said, “Not bad, your strength is now second only to mine. I believe your intelligence has also grown. In the future, when mating, you should lend a hand more often, personally.” 
Unexpectedly obtaining a mutant variant, who would need hero variants? 
However, it was predictable that the breeding probability of mutant variants would be even lower than that of hero variants, possibly producing none out of a hundred attempts. 
“Yes, Boss!” 
For now, Gobu Shan had no intention of challenging Lin Tian and obediently followed his orders. 
In the following period, Lin Tian’s main task was to monitor the actions in Bright Town. 
The rest was left to the captured humans. 
The more they could reproduce, the stronger the tribe would become. 
Lin Tian directly activated the crazy Life Simulation mode, hoping to cross over if possible. 
[Life Simulation System starting, current scenario: Breeding Third-Generation Goblins 
The events in Bright Town have come to an end, giving you golden time to expand the tribe. The Sword Saintess is in a long-term state of mental daze and won’t pose a threat for now. 
However, you still keep an eye on Bright Town’s situation daily to avoid any sudden changes. 
Day by day, the residents of Bright Town gradually resumed their usual lives, with nothing special happening. 
In the blink of an eye, a month had passed. 
You eagerly returned to the tribe to check on the production of third-generation goblins.] 
“End simulation, extract life progress.” Lin Tian said at this time. 
He needed to personally inspect the situation of this batch of third-generation goblins and then implement a new breeding plan. 
[Summary: A month passes quickly; cherish your time. 
Rating: 10 out of 100 
Reward: 10 life points 
This Life Simulation is complete, covering a time span of one month.] 
Soon after Lin Tian returned to the tribe, the second batch of third-generation goblins began to be produced. 
Due to the previous attempt at cultivating third-generation goblins, only two had survived. 
So this was the second batch. 
Out of a hundred breeding tools, including multiples, a total of 300 third-generation goblins were born. 
Forty survived, and they all had excellent talents. 
Their attributes at birth were several times higher than those of ordinary goblin offspring. 
The efficiency was barely acceptable. 
For the third batch, Lin Tian planned to have all 50 females bred by Gobu Shan. 
He wanted to test the survival rate of mutant goblin breeding. 
This time, unlike the elves, these humans were pure breeding tools. After giving birth, they would rest for a few hours before continuing to breed. 
Their value was not as high as the elves’. 
As long as they didn’t die, that was sufficient. 
Another month passed, and the third batch of goblins was born. 
“Damn, gambling dogs must die! Not a single one of the mutant goblin offspring survived?” Lin Tian was furious. 
Now he understood the low survival rate of mutant variants, probably as low as 2%. 
It was more important to focus on producing more third-generation goblins first. 
The third month passed. 
This time, seventy survived! 
In three months, they had accumulated 150 third-generation goblins, all of which could easily evolve into hero variants, with attributes much stronger than those evolved in the wild. 
Life was a bit too peaceful, and Lin Tian even wondered if the Lionheart Empire had given up on Bright Town? 
After all, it was a large town with the potential to expand into a city. 
Finally, a few days later, Lin Tian noticed a team entering Bright Town.
