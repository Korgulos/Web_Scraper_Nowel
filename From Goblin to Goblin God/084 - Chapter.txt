Chapter 84: Found it! Lolita Kingdom 
TL: Sungmin  
“Did you know that the existence of Despair has rewritten the entire history of ancient dragons? Because of your goblin genes, her strength far exceeds imagination. 
If this continues, in a few more months, I will no longer be the Dragon King. It’s taken us fire dragons thousands, tens of thousands of years to finally become Dragon King, and now you expect me to let the crystal dragons take it away so soon?” 
As the Flame Dragon Mother spoke, tears of unwillingness actually flowed from her eyes. 
Lin Tian finally understood; this guy was very competitive. 
But it made sense. 
Ever since the ancient dragons appeared in history, the position of Dragon King had mostly been occupied by crystal dragons, light and dark dragons, and elemental dragons. 
Elemental dragons were not like the Flame Dragon Mother, who was solely of the fire element. 
They could use multiple elemental attacks. 
“I see, then I will fulfill your request. Now, tell me the coordinates of the dwarves.” 
Lin Tian didn’t want to bother with these matters. As for what would happen next, it would certainly be beneficial to him. 
Both would be his children, and they might even help him rule the dragons. 
The Flame Dragon Mother pondered for a moment before saying, “Over a hundred years ago, I remember the Dwarf Kingdom was in the underground palace around the Rocky Mountains. They built a kingdom for their branch, very hidden. If there are any dwarves still alive, they must be there.” 
“The Rocky Mountains, huh.” 
Lin Tian nodded slowly, “Then send me out.” 
“I, I don’t have the strength now. How could a little goblin like you be so…” 
The Flame Dragon Mother blushed deeply. She hadn’t expected to be bested by a goblin. 
After a long wait, she finally sent Lin Tian up. 
“Little Black, take me out. I need to go.” 
Nidhogg’s eyes were full of sorrow and reluctance, “Father, are you leaving? Can’t you stay with me and mom a bit longer?” 
He had often been mocked as an orphan before. 
Now, he was very happy to have a father. 
But he hadn’t expected to part so soon. 
“I will come back to see you later, but I have some matters to attend to now.” 
Lin Tian sighed, wanting to pat her head, but he realized he couldn’t even reach her toenails. 
At this moment, Nidhogg lowered her head. 
Indicating for Lin Tian to climb up. 
“Good child, I’ll take you out to play later.” 
Lin Tian finally patted her head. 
He left the ancient dragons. 
… 
Riding on Xiao Huan, he began to head towards the Rocky Mountains to find the dwarves’ underground palace. 
The Rocky Mountains were far away, and days quickly passed. 
When he saw the endless, lush green mountains, he felt his breathing become much more comfortable. 
The entire mountain range showed no signs of enchantment, which was very rare. 
It was said to be because of the protection of the ancient god Loki. 
Lin Tian was still cautious as he flew in the air; this place was no longer within the borders of the Lionheart Empire. 
He didn’t know what country this was. 
But he knew that not all countries worshipped Jehovah like the Lionheart Empire. 
Jehovah was the one who managed the Kingdom of Angels. 
Other countries worshipped the twelve main gods of ancient Greece, the lineage of Zeus. 
Some worshipped the ancient Norse gods like Odin and Thor. 
This Rocky Mountain range was certainly in a country that worshipped the ancient Norse gods. 
“I definitely won’t find the dwarves’ underground city. I’ll have to see if any dwarves appear.” 
Lin Tian found a mountain peak to rest on first. 
From a high vantage point, he slowly observed. 
Using his keen skills, he could see very far and clearly. 
As soon as he saw a dwarf, he could capture him and force him to reveal the location of the underground palace. 
As for searching the entire continent for decades and still not finding it, he didn’t have that kind of confidence. 
Sure enough, after staking out various places for several days, he spotted a dwarf. 
No, this one looked almost human. 
Weren’t dwarves supposed to be burly, with large hands and feet, wearing leather clothes, sporting big beards, and drunk all the time? 
But the one emerging from a rock crevice ahead looked just like a human child. 
Sneaking around, looking left and right. 
Lin Tian directly swooped down on his flying dragon. 
Accurately capturing him. 
“Help! Help!!” 
The dwarf screamed in fear, but it was useless. 
Lin Tian threw him onto a flat mountaintop and paralyzed him with an Elemental Hand Crossbow. 
When the dwarf saw it was a goblin, his heart shattered, “Why is there a goblin here! I’m going to die! Boohoo!” 
He had originally wanted to find a flower for the dwarf girl he was pursuing. 
But he ended up like this. 
“Don’t shout. If you want to live, listen to me. Tell me, are you a dwarf?” 
Lin Tian coldly questioned, holding a dagger to his neck. 
The cold touch was like the song of death. 
Scaring him into confessing everything, “I am, I am!” 
Lin Tian’s eyes lit up, thinking to himself, “Perfect,” and said, “Now tell me where the Dwarf Kingdom is. You have no chance to bargain or hesitate, understand?” 
As he spoke, he applied pressure, the dagger’s edge cutting into the dwarf’s delicate neck skin. 
A drop of blood trickled down. 
The dwarf’s psychological defenses crumbled completely before they could even form. 
He hurriedly said, “Go through the stone crevice. There’s a password stone door. The password is 666. You need to input it to enter. I know what you want. I’ve told you everything. Please let me go!” 
“Boohoo, Little Mei, I don’t want to die yet. I haven’t even won you over. I’m still a virgin!” The dwarf cried as he spoke. 
Lin Tian frowned slightly, “Are you a simp? Is this Little Mei worth it?” 
He was about to die, yet he still thought about Little Mei. 
“Don’t insult my Little Mei! You ugly goblin!” 
The dwarf was immediately enraged, his eyes filled with hatred. 
Lin Tian felt disgusted, “I was wondering why the sky cleared up; turns out you rendered me speechless.” 
With that, he applied a bit of force. 
The dagger pierced directly into the dwarf’s neck. 
Blood spurted out like a fountain. 
The dwarf convulsed on the ground for a few moments before losing all signs of life. 
Lin Tian used Fusion Devour to consume all his flesh. 
This allowed him to transform into the dwarf’s appearance. 
Even Xiao Huan was bewildered, unable to recognize Lin Tian at all. 
“Don’t be surprised. This is the most powerful aspect of Abnormal Fusion. After merging, I can choose to retain my appearance or not.” Lin Tian chuckled, soothingly. 
His eyes focused on the previous rock crevice. 
“Xiao Huan, you stay here for now. I need to go to the Dwarf Kingdom. Wait for me to come back.” 
Then, Lin Tian leaped down the mountain. 
He didn’t know how long it would take. 
He needed to acquire a large number of magical tools or the dwarves’ forging techniques to mass-produce magical tools himself. 
By then, he could build a trump card army. 
Arriving outside the rock crevice, he couldn’t help but marvel at how hidden it was, “It’s just the right size for a dwarf to enter. If you’re not careful, you wouldn’t even notice the crack.” 
Hugging the rock wall, he went inside. After just a meter or two, it was a dead end. 
The password door the dwarf mentioned was nowhere in sight. 
Everything around seemed naturally formed. How could there be a door? 
After fumbling around for a while, he finally noticed that some protruding parts of the stone wall could be pressed. 
Counting to the sixth protrusion, he pressed it three times. 
The stone wall in front of him slowly opened a small gap without making a sound! 
The craftsmanship was exquisite! 
Lin Tian became more convinced of the dwarves’ skills and hurriedly went inside. 
Following the narrow path, he soon found himself in a vast, open area. 
This wasn’t an underground palace; it was a paradise! 
White clouds, blue skies, green grass, and flowing water! 
From his elevated position, he could overlook the entire underground palace, which spanned about twenty to thirty kilometers, with a city in the center surrounded by pristine natural scenery. 
Lin Tian followed the path towards the Dwarf Kingdom. 
There were no guards, and the city gates were wide open. 
The streets were filled with dwarves in various outfits, strolling and enjoying life. 
They looked like small versions of humans, not pure-blooded dwarves. 
They were likely hybrids of dwarves and humans, which was why the Flame Dragon Mother described them this way. 
But as long as he could master the forging techniques for magical tools, the lineage didn’t matter. 
These hybrids suited Lin Tian’s tastes even more! 
Not to mention the men. 
The key was that the dwarf women were, simply put, heavenly! 
“Little…lolis!! My god, so many little lolis!” 
As Lin Tian entered the main city, his eyes couldn’t take it all in. 
Ponytail lolis, twin-tail lolis, bunny girl lolis, uniformed lolis, maid lolis, mature lolis… 
… 
Sky clear up, speechless -&gt; Chinese pun 无雨 (no rain) wu yu＝无语 (speechless) wu yu.
