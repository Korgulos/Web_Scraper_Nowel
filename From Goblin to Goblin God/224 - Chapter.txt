Chapter 224: The ‘Rescue’ of Lin Tian Operation 
TL: Sungmin  
“That’s right, the outside world has now been unified by His Majesty, the Goblin God. The safety of the Zerg Empire can be assured.” 
“So your role isn’t important anymore. Go die for me!” the Queen Ant coldly ordered. 
However, the Ant King was not on board. “But if I die, the safety of the ant race won’t be guaranteed… Your Majesty, forgive me for disobeying, especially with your presence…”  
His dark, bead-like eyes revealed a chilling gleam. 
He continued, “Gathering so many soldier ants—clearly, Her Majesty the Queen is aware of my intentions. But do you think these soldier ants can protect you?” 
“I can’t believe you really want me dead! I gave birth to you! Your life was given by me!” The Queen Ant, both shocked and furious, questioned him. 
The Ant King hesitated briefly, then spoke, “But my duty is to protect the ant race. Your delusion of opposing the Zerg Queen will lead the ant race to an eternal doom. Therefore, I must eliminate you and nurture a new Queen…” 
“In that case, go die! There can only be one Queen!”  
The next moment, countless soldier ants surged like a flood toward the Ant King! 
Swish! 
Yet the Ant King’s demon-level strength was no joke. With a single push, he sent waves of soldier ants flying. 
The sharp spines on his body were deadly weapons! 
He easily harvested the lives of many soldier ants. 
The speed at which the soldier ants swarmed in couldn’t match the speed at which he slaughtered them! 
In such a losing situation, the Ant King quickly approached the Queen Ant, his murderous intent soaring! 
“Forgive me, Queen!” The Ant King’s goal was clear as he rushed forward, his aura overwhelming. 
Seeing this, the Queen Ant trembled in fear. “Your Majesty, the Goblin God, act quickly!” 
Pfft! 
Suddenly, a pure white spear shot up from the ground! 
Unfortunately, the Ant King’s carapace was too tough. Although it aimed for his heart, it slipped and stabbed into his left abdomen instead. 
“Goblin King?! I knew you were involved! I didn’t want to be your enemy, but now you must die too!”  
The Ant King, seemingly unaffected, struck back at Lin Tian! 
The terrifying force was so overwhelming that the mere wind from his fist nearly suffocated him! 
Fortunately, Lin Tian had the advantage of speed and easily dodged. “Hmph, it’s a pity I couldn’t kill you, but next time you won’t be so lucky…” 
He retreated as he spoke. 
More soldier ants charged forward, overwhelming the Ant King. 
In the chaotic battle, Lin Tian repeatedly tried to ambush and stab the Ant King, but it was much harder now. Having been exposed, the Ant King was constantly on guard. 
Since that’s the case, it was time for a head-on fight! 
With a combat power of 16,000, only a difference of 1,000, if Lin Tian couldn’t take him down, that would be too pathetic. 
“Forget it, I planned to wait for you to wear yourself out, but time is tight, so I’ll take you down now.” Lin Tian’s face darkened. 
The Ant King warily stared at him, just about to say something. 
Then, a deafening screech pierced the air! 
Lin Tian used Ruinous Howl and immediately launched a fierce assault, slicing off both of the Ant King’s arms in one strike. 
“Die!” 
The enraged Ant King, now clear-headed, roared and struck back. 
Lin Tian quickly retreated and used his long-range skill, Anubis’ Soul Drain! 
By now, the Hero’s Power’s Blessing had already been activated. 
This time, it once again left the Ant King stunned. 
With two strong control skills, Lin Tian didn’t fear one-on-one combat with anyone; he was just cautious by nature. 
Seizing the moment, he created two more gaping wounds on the Ant King’s body! 
“Be careful, his recovery ability is strong!” the Queen Ant warned. 
But Lin Tian didn’t care in the slightest. “Is that so?” 
The Ant King, feeling the excruciating pain in his body, pulled back to recover his injuries. 
Yet, after waiting for a while, his wounds failed to heal. 
In disbelief, he muttered, “This is impossible! Why can’t I recover?” 
“Nothing is impossible!” Lin Tian said as he flashed forward to continue his pursuit. 
In their fierce clash, Lin Tian began to overpower the Ant King. 
This only made the Ant King more incredulous. “How could a goblin possibly possess strength on par with mine?! Who are you, really?!” 
The breathing technique allowed Lin Tian to exert maximum strength perfectly. 
Each casual strike of his was equivalent to others fully charging for several seconds. 
Lin Tian still appeared relaxed. “Stop resisting. You’re already in your death throes!” 
As he spoke, he transformed into a black meteor, darting swiftly! 
“I’ve got you!!” The Ant King roared hysterically, unleashing a full-force strike directly in front of him! 
His powerful arm, capable of cleaving mountains and splitting the earth, shot forward! 
Boom! 
The sound of an explosion echoed! 
Lin Tian was flung out of the dust cloud, sliding a considerable distance before steadying himself. 
All around him, pieces of his shattered life armor lay scattered. 
However, like a swarm of insects, the soldier ants reassembled and crawled back onto him. 
Amidst the smoke and dust, Lin Tian pulled out his almost rusted Elemental Hand Crossbow, switching to fire element and shooting forward! 
Boom!!!! 
What was thought to be a minor blast erupted into an overwhelming inferno, flooding the entire palace like a tidal wave! 
Lin Tian turned around without needing to look back. 
The swirling dust in the air only required a small flame to ignite a dust explosion. 
And the Ant King stood right in the center of the dust zone, suffering the full brunt of the damage. 
When everything calmed down, 
a charred corpse lay on the ground. 
The Ant King had lost all signs of life. 
The others were merely lightly scorched by the flames, not enough to cause serious injury. 
“Done,” Lin Tian said casually. 
He hadn’t even broken a sweat. 
Killing a Demon King was possible, but usually, there wasn’t much need for it. 
As a boss-level figure, he typically wouldn’t get involved personally. 
But this time, there were no underlings to take care of things. 
The Queen Ant’s eyes were wide with hearts in them, “Oh my! Goblin King, if only you were my slave! Of course, not a labor slave! Or… let me be your slave instead! Just like you!” 
Seeing her like this, 
Lin Tian raised an eyebrow slightly, “Really?” 
“Absolutely! I think I’ve truly fallen in love with you, Goblin King—strong, sexy, and even capable of satisfying the Zerg Queen! There’s no one else like you!” The Queen Ant gushed with infatuation. 
For the first time in a thousand years, she felt as though she was a princess being rescued. 
Lin Tian never expected things to turn out this way. 
He had originally planned to trap the Queen Ant and imprison her as a breeding tool. 
But now, it seemed there was no need for any devious plots. 
She was willing on her own. 
“Alright then, send someone to kill the new Queen Ant later, and then, birth me a mixed-blood army to hide in this underground palace, how about that?” Lin Tian said heavily, gazing at her. 
Upon hearing this, 
the Queen Ant bit her red lips in excitement, exclaiming, “I’d be more than happy! So happy, Goblin King! Come on!” 
As she spoke, a large number of ant eggs began to drop behind her. 
Seeing how eager she was, 
Lin Tian felt relieved and couldn’t help but marvel at how bizarre the situation had become. 
The goddess you’re chasing might just be someone else’s star-slave. 
Without further ado, he began the process of impregnating the Queen Ant. 
One time was all it took to produce millions of mixed-blood ants. 
This was precisely what Lin Tian valued. 
Although goblin reproduction was already fast, it was still too slow compared to the ant and Zerg races. 
With a massive production machine like this, 
as long as there were enough resources, they could keep producing endlessly. 
After everything was settled, Lin Tian hurried back to the Zerg Queen’s palace. 
As soon as he entered, 
he could feel the Zerg Queen’s sinister killing intent. “Where have you been? Didn’t we agree you’d be out for only an hour? Why were you gone so long?” 
“Your Majesty, I took a brief walk, spent a little more time, please don’t be angry,” Lin Tian said, suppressing his own murderous urges. 
If not for fear of ruining his plans, he would have killed this wretch already. 
But killing her would be futile; the Zerg race would just evolve a new Queen, one that would inherit all the previous one’s memories. 
Unless they were completely exterminated, killing her would be meaningless. 
This made them far more terrifying than the ant race. 
Even a male Zerg could transform into a new Queen. 
He wasn’t even sure if the current Queen had been male before. 
Upon hearing his explanation, 
the Zerg Queen still looked displeased. “Hmph, as punishment, I’ll make you work ten times harder! Only after that can you rest or eat!” 
“This… Your Majesty, that would kill me!”  
Ten times harder—it really would be too much! 
Lin Tian was genuinely a bit frightened. 
But the Zerg Queen remained relentless. “What’s the matter? Don’t you love me? If you love me, can’t you handle even this? Didn’t you say you wanted to be my slave? My slave dares to disobey me?” 
Under her oppressive dominance, 
Lin Tian had no choice but to comply obediently. 
… 
Meanwhile, at the Goblin Empire, 
The Flame Dragon Mother returned immediately upon receiving the Ant Scout’s report. 
She gathered everyone and delivered the news. 
“Ah?!” 
Everyone gasped, covering their mouths in shock. 
Their eyes were filled with sympathy and worry for Lin Tian. 
The One-Eyed Owl spoke gravely, “That kid has had it so tough. I can’t act recklessly anymore, I have to treat him well from now on…” 
“Tian Ge, you’re a real man! For the greater good, you willingly became the Zerg Queen’s star-slave. I can’t even imagine it—marrying a mountain is one thing, but to have to… with a mountain!”  
Osius and Grugia both sighed in admiration, filled with respect! 
Alice, Gobu Kuang, Gobu Yue, and the others were deeply concerned. “Our boss… Damn it, we’re too weak, we can’t even go directly to help him!” 
“Sigh! Why… why can he even handle mountain-like creatures, while I…” Master Bill didn’t feel sorry for Lin Tian. 
Instead, he felt sorry for himself. 
The Flame Dragon Mother was utterly perplexed. “Are you all missing the point? What you should be focusing on isn’t that, but preparing to fight the Zerg Empire. They have at least a hundred million soldiers, with countless high-level warriors! If you want to rescue him, you need to get stronger fast and start mass-producing goblins immediately!” 
“That’s right, right, right! I’ll arrange for troop production right now!”  
Gobu Yue, flustered and panicked, quickly calmed down and got to work. 
First, she doubled the rewards given for each goblin soldier delivered, applicable to all races. 
This way, it wasn’t just the humans of the Goblin Empire who could help. 
Even the monsters from Goblin City could assist in the production. 
Additionally, she ordered Gobu Kuang and the others to head to other city-states across the continent and enforce conscription! 
The goal was to produce over a hundred million goblins in the shortest time possible!
