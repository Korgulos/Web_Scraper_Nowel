Chapter 134: Stealing Your Love! Lucky Theft! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Open the system store.” 
First, 
Lin Tian did not lack weapons now; he still had many world-class magic tools. 
There were so many that there was no place to use them. 
Unless the Spear of Zeus broke. 
But even if it wasn’t used, he wouldn’t casually give it to his subordinates. If it were spotted by sharp-eyed scouts from other empires, the consequences could be more serious than imagined. 
Even if he couldn’t snatch it, spreading the news would make him a wanted man in all empires. 
A coalition of two or three small empires could be dealt with. 
But a coalition of dozens of major empires could flatten the Goblin Empire in thirty minutes. 
So, he looked at the skills page again. 
The skills he had exchanged before were all indirect combat boosts. 
For example, Blood of Ruin and Abnormal Fusion. 
They weren’t direct. 
In so many battles, he hadn’t used any cool, flashy skills. Watching others use world-class magic that could cover the sky and block out the sun made Lin Tian envious. 
He had been hiding for so long, often using the life simulation system to earn life points, always choosing high-rated options with a high chance of death. 
There was no other intention, purely aiming for life points. 
Plus, some titles and achievements. 
So he had accumulated five hundred life points. 
This time, he planned to exchange for a skill comparable to world-class. 
[Ultimate Skills. (Note! Requires a minimum of five hundred life points!)] 
‘Triple Disaster: Can summon either a meteor, an earthquake, or a flood to attack the enemy’ 
‘Anubis’s Soul Drain: Deals a soul-crushing blow to the enemy, rendering them completely incapacitated for ten seconds, unresponsive to any form of awakening. If the enemy’s level is five levels lower than the user’s, it will execute them instantly. 
Note: Effective only below level 100, ineffective above level 100’ 
It was equivalent to only being able to execute a level 95 enemy. 
But that was already extremely broken. 
A level 95 was already a top-tier strongman on this continent. 
‘Eternal Frozen Realm: The sun extinguishes, darkness descends, and everything becomes a thing of the past in the wind and snow…’ 
,,, 
Looking at the myriad of powerful skills. 
Lin Tian was not very satisfied, or rather, he wanted every one of them. 
Seeing one, he found another that was very good. 
Some particularly powerful skills could turn the tide of battle, yet felt somewhat inappropriate. 
Finally, in the ‘Limited-Time Exchange’ section, he accidentally found a skill quite suitable for himself. 
He always upheld the noble virtue of letting others die instead of himself. 
Basically, he had his subordinates fight while he stayed out of it. 
Moreover, now he had Alice, such a ridiculously powerful henchman. 
So, this ‘Lucky Theft’ indeed suited his taste. 
“Forget it, forget it, I’ll get the flashy skills later. This Lucky Theft is a limited-time exchange!” 
Lin Tian decisively exchanged for it. 
Limited-time exchanges refreshed daily, featuring a variety of very precious items. 
Lucky Theft was the cheapest, just 500 life points. 
There was also ‘Hand of Creation: 100,000 life points.’ 
It could create a creature, item, or rule belonging solely to the user every day. 
It was simply heaven-defying. 
Another lesser item, ‘Doomsday Horn,’ could summon a heavenly purge upon this world, causing ultimate chaos. 
It required ten thousand life points. 
It was so exaggerated that Lin Tian didn’t even dare to imagine it. 
However, Lucky Theft was already very good. 
‘Lucky Theft: Can steal something precious or deeply cherished from the opponent, not limited to items. 
Note: Can only be used on one person per day.’ 
This meant he could even steal someone’s love! 
Directly making a rich and beautiful lady, a great heiress, or a noble princess fall in love with him! 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but chuckle wickedly. 
Even if he couldn’t steal love, it would still be something precious, like weapons or items. 
This was a conceptual ability. 
Lin Tian suddenly wondered, did this mean he could steal chastity as well? 
But stealing that without physical contact seemed impossible, though for some people, or many women, chastity was very precious. 
In a traditionally-minded world, a woman’s purity was one of the most important things. 
Just thinking about it was confusing, so Lin Tian decided to test it in practice later. 
“I almost forgot about this, system, sorry, but I’m going to target you~ Hehehe.” 
Lin Tian looked at the extracted skill, chuckling mischievously to himself. 
“Host, please don’t mess around. I’m set up as an innocent and pure girl, don’t mess around…” 
The mechanical voice, tinged with fear, only made Lin Tian more excited. 
“Lucky Theft!” 
As his hand glowed with a layer of glassy light. 
He immediately used it on the system. 
‘Congratulations, you have stolen the skill worth 500 life points, Anubis’s Soul Drain!’ 
What the hell? 
Lin Tian never thought it would actually work this way! 
He had just thought about it, but it turned out he could indeed exploit the bug! 
Just a moment ago, he wanted to exchange for this skill. Because of Gobu Yue, his level was unrestricted. 
Later on, he could execute opponents up to level 99! 
‘Ding! A bug has been detected in the system. Maintenance will be conducted for one month. During this period, the host cannot use the life simulation.’ 
“Damn!” 
Lin Tian’s smile froze instantly. 
Being unable to use the life simulation for a month was no big deal. 
But it meant he couldn’t exploit the system bug anymore. Who the hell was fixing these bugs? 
However, it was still a huge gain. 
“Your Majesty, why are you so happy?” Fiona asked, puzzled. 
Lin Tian revealed a wicked smile, “Nothing, let me test something on you.” 
Saying this, he used Lucky Theft on her! 
‘Congratulations, you have obtained Fiona’s courage! You will become as brave and fearless as a centaur warrior! 
Would you like to take it?’ 
Lin Tian was stunned. He didn’t expect this. 
It wasn’t of much use to him, so he returned it. 
Fiona looked a bit dazed, “Why did I feel a surge of fear just now? Is there some danger around?” 
“No, let’s move on. We’re still quite far from the capital of the Sword Kingdom,” Lin Tian said. 
,,, 
Soon, everyone finally returned to the Goblin Empire. 
The goblins in the royal city, led by Alice, came out to welcome them. 
On the city walls were Gobu Yue and the others. 
Around them, even leaders from nearby human settlements brought their people to welcome them. 
The human settlements were only a few kilometers from the Goblin capital, so news traveled fast. 
“Welcome back, Your Majesty!” 
“Long live the triumphant return of Your Majesty!” 
“Long live!!” 
Hearing the enthusiastic cheers of his followers, Lin Tian finally understood why everyone wanted to be an emperor. 
The feeling was exhilarating. 
However, after returning, Lin Tian walked on his own without riding Fiona. 
He feared being seen by other centaurs, making it hard to explain. 
She wasn’t conquered by Lin Tian but moved by him. 
As a leader, she needed to maintain some dignity. 
Lin Tian didn’t make it difficult for her, as she had helped a lot. 
“Gobu Kuang has also evolved? That’s great, that guy is really loyal, even as the Goblin King, he remains so faithful,” Goblin Slayer on the city wall couldn’t help but laugh. 
Once he became a king variant, he wouldn’t be under her control. 
Yet he had no plans to rally all the goblins for rebellion. 
After all, he was raised by Lin Tian. If he had grown alone through countless humiliations, survival, and conflicts, he would be extremely cunning. 
Entering the royal city, Gobu Kuang couldn’t wait to go play with the humans. 
Lin Tian had to follow up on the matter of his and the Black Goat Mother Goddess’s child. 
He believed that Rebecca’s mood should have recovered by now. 
It was time to ask about the specific situation. 
Arriving at the dungeon. 
Lin Tian asked the guard, “How has she been recently?” 
“Boss, she’s been unconscious these days, not saying a word or moving at all.” 
The eunuch guard answered. 
Lin Tian frowned, speculating. 
He didn’t dare to go in rashly, suspecting it might be a trick. 
But suddenly, he remembered something. 
Previously, just looking at the Black Goat Spawn could drop one’s sanity. If it dropped to zero, one would go insane. 
Rebecca likely looked into the eyes of the child she gave birth to. 
Causing her sanity to drop to zero. 
Thus, he wasn’t afraid of being bewitched by her. 
Lin Tian went in directly, and sure enough, she looked like a corpse, her hands tied up, kneeling on the ground. 
Her eyes were empty. 
This kind of situation was difficult to recover from. 
Unless purified by holy magic. 
But she was a monster; purification would either kill or severely injure her. 
“You were destined to die. If you can’t be saved, you can only blame your bad luck.” 
Lin Tian looked at her and spoke to himself. 
He could only gamble. If he used Lucky Theft to steal her love. 
Then he could give her a new spiritual support to live again. 
‘Here we go!’ 
“Congratulations, you have obtained Rebecca the Succubus’s love. Would you like to take it?” 
Lin Tian was stunned, staring at the system prompt, completely dumbfounded. Lucky Theft was indeed very lucky! 
Immediately! 
Rebecca’s empty eyes gradually showed a response. 
And it even formed a heart shape, her body writhing as if something was about to burst forth. 
“Darling~~~ Darling, where are you!” 
Rebecca suddenly stood up, her eyes locked onto Lin Tian. 
She seemed extremely eager. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but marvel at her luck. She still didn’t die. 
Just as he was about to inquire. 
Gobu Tian’s voice sounded outside. 
“Boss, the Sword Kingdom has issued a challenge to us. The battle location is at the border between the two countries. It seems they want to duel us.” 
Lin Tian was slightly taken aback, “Duel? I was planning to take them down. Since they want a duel, they shouldn’t blame me for playing dirty.” 
Saying this, he left the dungeon. 
Leaving Rebecca, who was filled with longing, “Darling! Don’t go! What will I do if you leave!” 
“Fiona, later you’ll lead the army to the border area, we’ll go ahead first.” 
Lin Tian gathered everyone in the royal hall and said. 
He planned to confront Edward and the others first. Then, halfway through the fight, even if they couldn’t win, the army’s intervention would exhaust him to death. 
As for Rebecca, she couldn’t escape now and had her love stolen. 
He could ask her later.
