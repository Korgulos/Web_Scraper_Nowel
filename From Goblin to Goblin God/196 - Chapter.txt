Chapter 196: Night Assault on the Palace 
TL: Sungmin 
A towering figure, over two meters tall, emerged from the magic circle. 
He wielded a long spear and a round shield. 
His muscles glistened with sweat, exuding an aura of raw power. 
With a wide-open mouth, he roared, “I will tear your ass apart!!!” 
However, 
Lin Tian simply flew forward with a kick, and the sound of bones snapping echoed immediately! 
The gladiator crashed into the edge of the arena, spewing blood from his mouth! 
His internal organs were shredded by the broken bones. 
This type of gladiator had only about three to four thousand combat power; Lin Tian could easily dispatch him now. 
Seeing this, Sara was furious but helpless, “Just wait! I will summon an even stronger creature, one that will make you wish you were dead! How dare you… how dare you do this to me…” 
She was nearly in tears as she spoke. 
The memories of what had just happened replayed in her mind, along with the relentless demands she had made. 
The shame was unbearable! 
She wished she could kill herself on the spot. 
“Don’t resist anymore; you’ve lost everything—your body, your honor, your country. Want to see? If you want to see, then bring that Queen Phantom Worm in too.” Lin Tian spoke coldly. 
Upon hearing this, Sara indeed wanted to see what was going on. Her greatest fear was that the entire Troy Empire had witnessed what had just happened to her. 
Honor was more precious than life. 
If that were true, it would be better to just die. 
Immediately. 
After the Phantom Worm entered, it activated its ability, projecting the scenes seen by other Phantom Worms. 
A few of the worms in Troy had managed to survive. 
In the projection, the King of Troy was giving a speech, “I will not ignore what just happened. I have stripped Muhammad Sara of all her titles and power. 
And I have sent Troy’s war gods to hunt her down! Justice will be served! This disgrace to Troy’s honor will not be tolerated!” 
Upon seeing her father say such words. 
Sara’s legs went weak, nearly causing her to collapse, “No, it’s impossible, how could this happen? Damn goblin! You’ve ruined everything!” 
Even the strongest of women would break down entirely now. 
“Hmph, so what? It seemed to me that you were enjoying yourself quite a lot earlier.” Lin Tian said. 
Upon hearing this, Sara recalled her actions from just moments ago, overwhelmed by shame and humiliation. 
She immediately drew the dagger from her waist and aimed it at her heart, ready to stab. 
She no longer had any face to live on, no face to see her people, and she didn’t want to be hunted by Trojan War Gods. 
Ending her life was the best choice. 
Seeing this, Lin Tian quickly said, “Do you think that if you die now, everything that happened will just disappear? You will still be remembered as Troy’s disgrace…” 
“Then what do you want! You’ve already done this to me; what more do you want? Why are you doing this to me!” Sara knelt on the ground, crying out in despair. 
Lin Tian slowly walked up to her, lifting her tear-streaked face with his hand, and said, “I can give you a chance to turn things around. You just need to obey.” 
“What… what chance?” 
Upon hearing this, Sara clung to Lin Tian’s leg in desperation. The humiliation she had suffered was nothing compared to the pain of her ruined reputation. 
Lin Tian revealed the final part of his plan, “It’s simple. Become my slave and assist me. When I attack the Troy Empire, you can appear to save the country. 
At that time, all the past will mean nothing. You will be remembered as the savior! The true hero of Troy, and they will crown you as king!” 
Sara bowed her head, quickly weighing her options. 
Indeed, it was a good plan, a highly effective one. 
This way, she would no longer be the disgrace of Troy but its savior! The true hero! 
Not only could she turn everything around, but she could also gain supreme glory, surpassing that of any past king. 
Without hesitation, Sara agreed, “I’ll do it! I’ll do anything! What do you need me to do?” 
The shame she had suffered was unbearable. 
After twenty years of rigorous training, her first mission had ended in disaster, worse than death. 
So, to regain her honor, she was willing to do anything. 
“Your companions have already infiltrated the palace, haven’t they? Come with me and let’s kill them all.” Lin Tian said calmly. 
Sara’s heart skipped a beat, and she was filled with disbelief, “How… how did you know? Was this all part of your plan?” 
“Hmph, not bad. If you perform well, I’ll give you everything you desire.” 
Lin Tian smirked, his tone laced with mockery. 
Sara was utterly shocked. It turned out she had been nothing more than a pawn all along. 
But nothing she said would change anything now. 
The outcome was already decided. 
She then dispelled the Troy Arena. 
Like a lifeless doll, she obediently followed Lin Tian toward the palace. 
… 
Inside the palace. 
The night was eerily silent, sending chills down one’s spine. 
Silver-white moonlight poured down, cold as if it condensed a layer of frost on the ground. 
Alice, the One-Eyed Owl, and Gobu Kuang all transformed into hunters, hiding along the palace’s inevitable paths. 
The One-Eyed Owl hung upside down like a bat in the Goblin Hall, with the entire Dragon Slayer Guild behind her. 
Even Little Black was there, helping out, waiting for the enemy to arrive. 
Alice, Gobu Kuang, and the others, along with the dragon-like subhumans led by the Flame Dragon Mother, lay in wait along the small paths of the dormitory area. 
They were certain the enemy would come there. 
At this moment, Luna and the other assassins from the Holy Tree Empire had already reached outside the hall. 
Someone had used the spell ‘Light Leaf Step,’ which greatly reduced the sound of their footsteps. 
However, standing in the wind, their scent was detected by Little Black. Its eyes glowed brightly in the dark, signaling to the others. 
It then covered its compound eyes to prevent the glow from attracting attention and exposing them. 
Luna, holding a spear crafted from the branches of the Holy Tree, made a gesture, and the group silently entered the hall. 
Seeing it was empty, they finally felt at ease. 
“Crack!” 
Suddenly, a piercing sound exploded in everyone’s ears like thunder! 
The Holy Tree warriors were so startled that their hearts nearly jumped out of their chests. 
Luna bitterly remarked, “Lord Tree Spirit, please don’t eat apples at a time like this. We’re on a mission, you know? We need to kill all those bad people.” 
“Oh, alright, Sister Luna…” 
The Tree Spirit waved its hand, and the apple turned to ash and dispersed. 
This scene was clearly observed by the One-Eyed Owl and her team, making them extremely wary. 
The Tree Spirit’s incarnation was an immensely powerful being. 
They had to seize the opportunity to focus their attacks and eliminate it in one swift strike. 
Lin Tian had instructed that if they faced the Tree Spirit, they must focus their fire. If they couldn’t kill it, they were to retreat immediately and wait for his support. 
At this moment, the One-Eyed Owl exchanged glances with her comrades. 
Now, while the enemy was off guard, was the perfect moment to strike! 
They all locked their targets on the Tree Spirit. 
Suddenly, Little Black gathered energy in its mouth and unleashed a jet-black flame like ghostly mist—a fire of annihilation! 
It could corrode everything! 
This flame fully inherited Lin Tian’s dark elemental power, but its body also possessed the abilities of a Crystal Dragon. 
Immediately afterward, the One-Eyed Owl charged toward the Tree Spirit, landing a heavy punch that sent it flying hundreds of meters to the plaza outside! 
Everything happened in the blink of an eye. 
No one had time to react! 
They only saw that the Tree Spirit had vanished, and the One-Eyed Owl was standing in front of them. 
Luna’s expression changed drastically, “You?! Prepare for battle! Kill her, One-Eyed Owl!” 
“Yes!” 
The Holy Tree warriors quickly drew their weapons. 
But suddenly, Osius and the others dropped down from the rafters, launching a surprise attack! 
They instantly killed one person and injured several others. 
Luna realized something was wrong, “It’s an ambush! Everyone retreat to outside the hall!” 
However, the One-Eyed Owl blocked the entrance, “Today, I’ll show you what it means to trap a dog in a closed door!” 
Luna and the others’ hearts pounded wildly, filled with tension. 
But suddenly, Luna seemed to calm down, “One-Eyed Owl, don’t be too arrogant. Look behind you!” 
Abruptly. 
The ground outside the hall erupted, and massive vines, each several meters thick, burst forth! 
They smashed down on the palace! 
“Boom!” 
A deafening sound echoed, and dust filled the sky! 
The once magnificent palace was reduced to ruins in the blink of an eye! 
Suspended in the plaza, the Tree Spirit glowed with a scorching white magical light, its eyes shining with the same white radiance, an awe-inspiring sight! 
Around it, a dozen thick vines writhed like tentacles, menacingly. 
The One-Eyed Owl and her group quickly retreated, shaken by the scene. 
Osius slapped his thigh, “Damn it, Tian’er won’t be mad, right? The palace just got demolished!” 
“Is this guy part of a demolition crew? He tore the place down in the blink of an eye! And what terrifying magical energy!” 
Grugia’s forehead was also slick with cold sweat. 
Even Little Black was taken aback, “How did she neutralize my flames?” 
Once hit by the flames of annihilation, they would only extinguish if the target was completely incinerated or turned to ash. 
Yet the Tree Spirit remained unscathed. 
The One-Eyed Owl dusted off her shoulder, “She didn’t neutralize it; she’s already died once. With the Tree Spirit’s power, it’ll be a while before she can reconstitute herself again.” 
“That’s right. Lord Tree Spirit is an embodiment of magic, not a physical entity.” 
Luna and the others stood beneath the Tree Spirit, speaking confidently. 
With such a powerful backer, how could they lose? How could they possibly lose? 
The One-Eyed Owl sneered, “Don’t get cocky. Killing you again won’t be that hard.” 
“Boom!!” 
The Tree Spirit immediately controlled a massive vine, several meters thick, and smashed it down on the One-Eyed Owl. 
“Big Sis!” 
The members of the Dragon Slayer Guild tensed up, deeply worried. 
Thankfully. 
The One-Eyed Owl caught the vine with both hands, managing to withstand the earth-shattering blow. 
The One-Eyed Owl forcefully flung the vine aside and leaped onto it, charging toward the Tree Spirit! 
Luna quickly issued an order, “Everyone, protect Lord Tree Spirit!” 
“Yes!” 
The group immediately began to intercept the attack. 
Little Black, no longer holding back, transformed into a massive dragon, its colossal form capable of restraining multiple vines at once. 
Luna and the others were terrified, “My god, what—what is this? A dragon? Wasn’t the dragon supposed to be in the Great Tomb?” 
They knew from intelligence reports that Lin Tian had allied with the dragon. 
But during their surprise attack, how could the dragon appear here without warning? 
There was only one possibility! 
Their plan had been leaked! 
“Don’t worry about that! With Lord Tree Spirit here, it’s only a matter of time before we kill them all!” Luna encouraged them. 
But in the next moment. 
She was sent flying by a powerful punch from the One-Eyed Owl! 
The Holy Tree branch spear she had been using to defend herself snapped in two on the spot. 
With her fists ablaze with scorching flames, the One-Eyed Owl continued her relentless pursuit, “Come on, let’s have some real fun!”
