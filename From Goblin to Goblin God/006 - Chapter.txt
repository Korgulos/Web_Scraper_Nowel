Chapter 6: Hunting Elves! 
TL: Sungmin 
The Goblin Priest walked slowly, bent down, and picked up the weapon. 
He had a face full of a sinister smile, “Heh heh heh! It’s really iron!” 
Suddenly, his expression changed, and he glared coldly at Lin Tian, “You can die now!” 
The next second, he charged at Lin Tian with the knife in hand! 
His speed was incredibly fast! 
“What? This old thing is so insidious!” 
Lin Tian had thought he definitely wanted to kill him, but he hadn’t expected him to be so straightforward! He even knew to strike first and use diversionary tactics! 
“Clang!” 
The sound of iron colliding rang out, sparks flying everywhere! 
The Goblin Priest, thinking he had succeeded, laughed sinisterly again, “Heh heh heh, here, goblins like you are not allowed to exist!” 
But turning his head, he saw Lin Tian still standing there unscathed. 
Because Lin Tian was wearing plate armor, he had withstood the blow. 
The Goblin Priest’s eyes widened instantly in anger, wanting to roar, but felt a sharp pain in his chest. 
Looking down, he saw a sharp spearhead had somehow pierced into him. 
“You! Ahhhhh! I’ll kill you!” 
The Goblin Priest couldn’t care about anything else and continued to resist. 
Lin Tian wasn’t foolish; he had long left a backup plan, hiding several spearheads on his body. 
When the priest charged, he threw them directly! 
“Swish swish swish!” 
In an instant, he took the priest down. 
His head, chest, arms, and face were all pierced with sharp spearheads. 
“Weaker than I imagined, it seems I overestimated the defensive power of goblins.” 
Lin Tian hadn’t expected to win so easily and remarked with a sigh. 
By killing him, he could take over this group of goblins, then rapidly grow them to seek revenge on the stubbled man and the white-robed nun! 
The Goblin Priest, lying on the ground, wailed like a slaughtered pig, “Don’t kill me, please, I took you in, you can’t kill me.” 
He made a pitiful crying face, but it was extremely creepy. 
Lin Tian’s expression changed slightly, surprised by this moral coercion. But he quickly recovered; this guy knowing these tactics wasn’t too much. 
He said, “Did you forget that I am a goblin?” 
Lin Tian’s expression was very cold, his eyes filled with evil killing intent. 
He was a goblin now; how could he be morally coerced? 
If he wanted to kill, he would kill. 
At this moment, the goblins who had gone out to find wooden sticks came back one after another. 
Seeing this scene, they all became enraged and ferocious, extremely excited, but didn’t know what to do. 
The Goblin Priest, as if grabbing a lifeline, hurriedly activated the summon skill, “Kill him! Kill him!” 
This voice shattered the forest’s tranquility, piercingly loud. 
However, the goblins remained unmoved, only slightly hesitant. 
The Goblin Priest, already in such a miserable state, had lost all authority, and his Call skill was ineffective. 
Lin Tian picked up the crescent moon blade on the ground, walked up to him, “From now on, I am your new boss! I will lead you to attack the elves! Attack humans! Ferociously mate! And have endless meat to eat!” 
In a moment, cheers erupted, “New boss! New boss!” 
“Slash!” 
Lin Tian cut off one of the Goblin Priest’s arms and threw it to the goblin crowd. 
“Boss! Boss!” 
The goblins swarmed like bees, beginning to fight over the food. 
Lin Tian then stepped aside, allowing the goblin crowd to completely devour the priest, eating him clean! 
Now, he was the boss of this group of goblins! 
And he had gained the ‘Call’ skill. 
“Boss, what’s going on?!” 
Gobu Yue was awakened by the noise, supported herself with a wooden stick, and came out to check the situation. 
Lin Tian explained it to her, almost scaring her silly, “You killed the priest? Oh my god! His attributes were so high!” 
“Thanks to your help, you go back to rest, I’ll handle things here.” 
Then Lin Tian calmed the emotions of the many goblins. 
He completed equipping all the iron spears, a total of fifty, which multiplied the combat power of this small tribe several times! 
He continued his victory speech, telling them to keep looking for iron ore, the more the better. 
Not only should every goblin have a weapon, but they also needed armor. 
This way, they could defeat the elves, capture more breeding tools, and expand the tribe’s population. 
The goblin infants born from elves could naturally grow into big goblins! 
Their strength far surpassed those born from animals. 
Five days passed. 
This time, they finally collected enough ore. 
They began large-scale iron smelting. 
Until everyone was equipped with armor and weapons, looking at this goblin tribe from afar was terrifying. 
It was comparable to an army. 
The pity was their low intelligence and lack of tactics. 
In battles, they basically relied on instinct. 
“Today, we will go to the enchanted forest to kill monsters. You must follow my orders, or you will die!” 
Lin Tian stood on a rock and shouted to all the goblins in the tribe. 
He planned to train them so that attacking the elves would be easier when the time came. 
Immediately, the goblin army set off in grand fashion! 
Their formation was orderly, and their momentum was extremely strong! 
Birds flew away in fright, and animals fled. 
Soon, in the distance, they saw a Tier 3 enchanted creature, a black-brown giant bear, devouring a large-horned deer! 
Its body was as large as an elephant! 
The surrounding fallen towering trees were enough to prove how ferocious this monster was! 
Killing it would be too difficult, far beyond what this group of goblins could manage. 
At most, they could look for some Tier 2 enchanted creatures. 
Finally, they encountered a pack of Tier 2 enchanted wolves. 
There were seven or eight of them, each as large as a donkey. 
These were creatures even the elves didn’t dare provoke, among the fiercest and most powerful of Tier 2. 
They were fast, strong, and even capable of climbing trees. 
The key was that the head wolf could command tactics. 
They roamed the enchanted forest without fear. 
Hearing the low growls of the evil wolves, some goblins were trembling in fear, “Boss, are we hunting the enchanted wolves?” 
Lin Tian thought for a moment and finally decided, “Yes, if we kill the enchanted wolves, our strength will increase significantly.” 
Checking through the system, he found that the enchanted wolves had a powerful skill. 
‘Iron-Blooded Wolf Nature’. 
Once blood was seen, their wolf nature would be triggered, gaining a 20% boost to all attributes and not feeling pain. 
“You go left, you go right, surround the wolf pack!” 
Under Lin Tian’s authoritative command, all the goblins suppressed their fear and obediently surrounded the pack of evil wolves. 
“Apply pressure!” 
Immediately, at Lin Tian’s order, all the goblins began to close in, pointing their iron spears at the wolves, forcing them closer together. 
The enchanted wolves started to grow agitated, growling and randomly charging at the iron spears. 
They wanted to break out. 
But after a few attempts, they were all cut and bleeding! 
Lin Tian commanded from the side, “Hold steady! Don’t panic! Press them tighter!” 
Now, they just needed to let the enchanted wolves doom themselves. 
Sure enough, the wolf pack began to panic, no longer listening to the head wolf’s commands, and they started to charge wildly. 
Each wolf was covered in wounds from the spears. 
Soon, they lost too much blood and began to collapse one by one. 
The goblin formation only got slightly disordered; after all, the enchanted wolves were still very strong. 
“Heh heh heh! Great! We killed them!” 
“We can even eat enchanted wolves!” 
“Long live the boss! Long live!” 
All the goblins raised their hands and cheered. 
They immediately started to divide and consume the enchanted wolves. 
“Gained ability: Iron Blood (Passive Skill: In combat, seeing blood grants a 20% boost to all attributes and negates pain for 3 minutes).” 
After eating, the system prompt sounded in Lin Tian’s mind. 
This was the goblins’ exclusive skill, Gene Devour, growing stronger by devouring powerful creatures. 
Although they were initially the weakest monsters, they had the potential to become the strongest. 
No wonder they were monsters blessed by the gods. 
Glancing around, he saw that most goblins had reached level ten, with the highest at level thirteen. 
Their attributes had also doubled. 
But it was still far from enough. 
Next, they needed to continue hunting monsters, ultimately aiming to hunt the black-brown giant bear! 
If they devoured its ‘Giant Mountain’ skill, these goblins’ health, strength, and defense would all multiply! 
It was unimaginable how strong they could become. 
Three days passed. 
This mighty goblin army had killed three Tier 2 monsters: the enchanted wolves, giant-toothed boars, and earth stone monsters. 
Four Tier 1 monsters: tailless cats, ghost-faced monkeys, double-headed snakes, and wandering spirits. 
Besides ‘Iron-Blooded Wolf Nature,’ they also gained the ‘Giant Tooth’ skill, allowing their teeth to grow larger and stronger, increasing attack power as they grew. 
Then there was ‘Stone Skin,’ which added 15 points to their basic defense, equivalent to wearing plate armor. 
The most important abilities came from the Tier 1 monsters ghost-faced monkeys and tailless cats. 
‘Climbing’ and ‘Silent Steps’. 
These would be crucial when attacking the elf tribe. 
The remaining abilities weren’t very useful. The double-headed snake could secrete venom, and the wandering spirit could turn into a ghost for a while after death. 
But for now, it was enough. 
At this moment, they heard the ground begin to vibrate rhythmically; some enormous monster was approaching! 
Lin Tian instantly became alert, “It’s here at the right time, the black-brown giant bear! Everyone, climb the trees!” 
“Caw caw caw!” 
A group of goblins shrieked, climbing the straight trees like monkeys, hiding in the darkness. 
Sure enough, the elephant-sized black-brown giant bear appeared, its crimson eyes like two bulbs! 
They shone brightly in the dark. 
“Whoosh, whoosh!” 
Its heavy breathing was particularly eerie! 
Its sheer size constantly reminded everyone that it was a giant beast. 
Estimated to weigh 20 tons! Although it was similar to an elephant, its bone density, muscle content, and steel-like fur added even more weight. 
In this enchanted forest, it truly ruled unchallenged! 
Every creature avoided it, even the enchanted wolf packs. 
The black-brown giant bear sniffed the air, discovered the mushrooms Lin Tian had thrown, and hurriedly started eating. 
Only then did everyone see its terrifying size, incredibly robust! It radiated an invisible pressure! 
It made people unconsciously slow their breathing.

The black-brown giant bear devoured the mushrooms in huge mouthfuls, consuming over a hundred pounds in the blink of an eye. 
It was about to leave. 
Having finally reached the perfect attack position, how could Lin Tian let it go? He gave the order, “Shoot it!” 
“Ahhh!” 
From the treetops, the goblins all let out roars! 
They swung their iron spears and thrust them down! 
One spear after another! 
But they soon regretted it. Iron spears couldn’t even pierce the black-brown giant bear’s skin! 
A Tier 3 monster’s power far exceeded that of Tier 2. 
Being attacked, the black-brown giant bear went berserk instantly, crashing around wildly. 
Although it couldn’t climb trees, with a casual collision, trees dozens of meters high fell like matchsticks. 
The goblins were thrown into a frenzy, fleeing for their lives. 
Lin Tian’s expression was solemn but not panicked, “That can’t be right. The Deathcap mushrooms’ poison can kill even Tier 4 monsters. How is this one not dead after eating so many? Is it immune?” 
But he had checked earlier, the black-brown giant bear didn’t have a poison immunity skill. 
Among the mushrooms it had eaten, many were highly toxic, and the iron spears were coated with the double-headed snake’s paralyzing venom. 
It seemed this beast was just too large, and the poison was taking too long to act. 
“Ah!” 
One by one, goblins screamed as the black-brown giant bear devoured them! 
In no time, four or five goblins had been eaten. 
Suddenly, Lin Tian’s eyes lit up, “Heh, if you don’t die, who will?” 
These goblins all had the double-headed snake’s venom secretion ability. Once ingested, the poison would act faster. 
The black-brown giant bear’s movements began to wobble. 
It tried to knock down trees but couldn’t aim properly. 
“Boom!” 
With a loud crash, the black-brown giant bear fell! 
“Caw caw caw!” 
Seeing this scene, all the goblins cheered wildly! 
Lin Tian quickly ordered, “Eat it all, gain the skill, and then leave quickly!” 
Gene Devour didn’t guarantee an immediate skill acquisition, but there was a high probability. 
“Congratulations to the host for acquiring the ‘Giant Mountain’ ability, doubling health!” 
After eating, despite a lot of the black-brown giant bear’s flesh remaining, they had to abandon it. 
The earlier commotion would surely attract more monsters. 
Returning to the tribe, Lin Tian was pleased to see these goblins, all their strengths significantly increased!

Now, even an ordinary goblin had a total strength over 200! 
Comparable to an average human adventurer. 
During this time, Lin Tian hadn’t neglected Gobu Yue either, whose level had risen to 30, with an overall strength of 400. 
Comparable to the stubbled man back then. 
“After going through so much, our strength has finally qualitatively improved.” 
Lin Tian felt deeply moved. In the tribe, the bonfire burned brightly, emitting the aroma of roasted meat. 
Compared to other transmigrators, his power increased too slowly, but it was the maximum extent possible. 
In this brutal world, where death lurked at every turn, survival was a huge challenge. 
“Boss, what are we going to do next?” 
Gobu Yue asked curiously. She had become like a little cat, always following Lin Tian around, very obedient. 
She had completely become his toy. 
But Lin Tian still treated her as a friend. He pondered, “It’s almost time to attack the elf tribe. That will greatly enhance our tribe’s strength.” 
Logically, their current power was enough to deal with the stubbled man. 
But that guy’s master was the Sword Saintess. If they were unlucky and ran into her, they would still face a crushing defeat. 
So, they needed to capture elves first, breed a new generation of goblins, and then have a perfect chance. 
Lin Tian didn’t want to go through such tormenting experiences again. 
This time, he was the hunter! 
But to be a hunter, he had to sharpen his blade first. 
… 
To the north, in the Myriad Forms Forest, lay the elf tribe. 
Many towering trees grew here, their trunks usually more than ten meters thick! The elves liked to carve out wooden houses high up in these trunks to live in. 
It was an excellent way to avoid enemies. 
Coupled with their proficiency in using bows and arrows, it made the place easy to defend and hard to attack. Many monsters, and even humans, came and could only leave in disgrace. 
As a result, the elves had occupied the forest for thousands of years.
