Chapter 49: Stirring Up Trouble Is My Forte 
TL: Sungmin 
Lin Tian was somewhat surprised, but upon reflection, it made sense. She was, after all, the Goblin Slayer. 
Immediately, Goblin Slayer responded, “I have heard about it. I had always wanted to exterminate that tribe, but for various reasons, I couldn’t go.” 
“What reasons could possibly stop you?” Lin Tian couldn’t help but ask. 
This guy wanted to kill goblins—who could possibly stop him? 
Goblin Slayer shrugged. “Isn’t it obvious? I couldn’t afford to offend their backers. The Beast King Tribe is affiliated with the Great Tomb. The monsters there are beyond even the Lionheart Empire’s ability to contend with.” 
As she spoke, she noticed something amiss. “Wait, did you guys kill him?” 
“Gulp.” Lin Tian swallowed hard and nodded awkwardly. 
He then inquired, “What exactly is this Great Tomb? You make it sound so terrifying.” 
Goblin Slayer thought for a moment and then explained, “It’s basically the ruler of the thousand-mile-wide enchanted forest to the west of the continent. I don’t know the specifics, but at least one 12th-tier monster, a world-class existence, resides there.” 
“That’s it, then. Twelfth-tier? What am I supposed to fight with, my head?” 
Lin Tian’s heart sank. Damn it, he had transmigrated into a goblin, and now he had to deal with political intrigue? 
But this kind of situation was unavoidable. 
Suddenly, he thought of a perfect plan. 
At this moment, Gobu Kuang was foolishly tearing off a beast goblin’s arm and savoring it. “This taste is delicious!” 
“Get out, get out!” Lin Tian hurriedly kicked him away. Looking at the beast goblin’s corpse, which was still mostly intact, he said, “Hey, what should I call you? You can control goblins, right? Help me out?” 
“Just call me Goblin Slayer. What do you want to do?” Goblin Slayer looked at him puzzled. 
Lin Tian first released the beast goblin’s soul from the magic ring and then had Goblin Slayer control it with her blood. 
Sure enough, just like with Gobu Tian and the others, after drinking Goblin Slayer’s blood, the beast goblin obediently followed orders. 
Lin Tian whispered to Goblin Slayer, “Order him to return to the Beast King Tribe and say that he was injured by nobles from the Lionheart Empire, who also stole the magic ring. You know, the Stantmont and Felemon families.” 
He had previously let Cecil go on purpose, planning to ambush him later and use Loder as a hostage to wipe them out and gain some experience points. 
Now, he hadn’t expected to gain even more experience points for free! 
What kind of sparks would fly between the Beast King Tribe and the imperial nobles? 
Goblin Slayer couldn’t help but admire him. “You’re becoming more and more interesting. Will you be the next Goblin King?” 
At this moment, she was eager to see what would happen next. Her eyes were filled with love for Lin Tian! 
Her eyes turned into heart shapes again. 
She quickly took off her armor and used royal blood to pin Lin Tian down, draining him wildly. 
“Don’t look, don’t look, Gobu Yue, Lia, even Lilith, why are you all out here? Gobu Kuang, you big fool too!” 
Lin Tian felt both embarrassed and pleased. 
He couldn’t understand why he was being overpowered! 
Lia blushed and lowered her head, murmuring to herself, “Is this how I looked when he dominated me? It’s so…embarrassing.” 
“Boss, I didn’t see anything.” 
Gobu Yue, the small goblin, with her flushed face, got so close to Lin Tian that she stared without blinking. 
Lin Tian said angrily, “Alright, alright, if that’s how it is, none of you will escape later!” 
“I-I’ll slip away first.” 
Gobu Yue stuck out her little tongue, pretending to be very busy. 
… 
In the Lionheart Empire, far from the range of Bright Town, there lay a massive human city. 
From a distance, the city appeared boundless, its skyline completely covered by its vast expanse. 
But the most striking feature was the gigantic golden lion statue, several thousand meters tall, in the center! 
It was the iconic building of the Lionheart Empire, the ‘Guardian Lion.’ 
In lion prides, the lion held a high status. Though it rarely hunted, it always led the charge when the pride faced danger. 
This represented the empire’s spirit. 
If the people faced foreign invasion, the empire’s forces would charge forward like a lion. 
At the lion’s feet stood a splendid and magnificent palace, guarded by soldiers in lion-headed silver armor. 
Surrounding it were the castles of the nobility. 
“Father! I’m sorry, I couldn’t complete the task you gave me. I’ve disgraced the honorable Felemon family! Boohoo!” 
In the grand hall of the Felemon family, Cecil, disheveled and hobbling on a crutch, walked in miserably. 
Upon seeing his father, he knelt in agony! 
Above him sat a dignified man in a Western-style leather robe, who already knew Cecil had returned. 
But he had no face to meet him because Cecil was unworthy. 
Almost the entire noble circle knew that Cecil, a Diamond-level adventurer and the eldest son of the Felemon family, had gone to exterminate a group of goblins to avenge the Loder family and himself. 
However, now the entire group had been wiped out, and he had lost a leg. 
Felemon’s face darkened as he coldly said, “Get out! I’m no longer your father! You worthless thing! You’ve brought shame to our family’s honor!” 
“Father, please listen to my explanation. Those goblins were very powerful and extremely intelligent. We were no match for them! Even the Gray Hat Heroes were completely annihilated! But, cousin Loder is still alive!” Cecil cried as he explained. 
Hearing that the Gray Hat Heroes were also completely wiped out, a flash of surprise crossed Felemon’s face. However, this did not restore the family’s honor. 
Previously, the Stantmont family had been laughing at Loder. 
Now? 
Both the Stantmont family and they were being laughed at together. 
In such an era, honor and reputation were extremely important, much like maintaining a clear name in ancient China. 
For nobles, honor was even more important than life. 
So even though Loder had died, the Stantmont family did not send anyone to rescue him. It was only at the Sword Saintess’s request that they dispatched two knight squads to assist. 
For someone who tarnished the family’s honor, death was the best outcome. 
Finally, Felemon said, “Do you know how outsiders are laughing at us? The eldest sons of two families were defeated by goblins?? Even if those goblins were very powerful, it’s still the same!” 
Goblins, the weakest monster species in people’s stereotypes. 
No matter how powerful they were, no one respected them. 
It was like being killed by a strong pile of shit or the king of shit. 
This would be a double death—both physically and in terms of reputation. 
“Father, I… I’m sorry… It was so terrifying, so terrifying…” 
Cecil knelt on the ground, recalling those terrifying scenes in agony. 
His body trembled continuously with fear, and he even wet himself on the spot! 
Everyone in the family was stunned by this scene! 
His siblings showed expressions of surprise and disdain. 
Cecil’s reputation was utterly ruined. 
Felemon’s expression was one of extreme discomfort, as if he had swallowed shit.  
“Goblins! Goblins! What use are you! Being reduced to this by goblins! Drag him out!” 
“Count Felemon, there’s no need to be so angry.” 
At this moment, another middle-aged man with a mustache and a maid by his side walked in. 
He was the head of the Stantmont family. 
Bill Stantmont. 
Seeing him, Felemon felt even more humiliated. “Stantmont, you’ve really caught me at a bad time. My son here is worse off than if he were dead like Loder! Look at his state! Is this still a noble? He’s worse than a commoner!” 
Stantmont glanced at the curled-up, crying Cecil and didn’t care. “Count Felemon, I came to propose that we join forces to restore our families’ honor.” 
“What do you mean? Don’t you know that His Imperial Majesty the Emperor has ordered that nobles above the rank of viscount must keep their troops ready at all times and cannot mobilize them at will?” Felemon said angrily. 
If they could easily mobilize troops, they would have already gathered a large force to wipe out the goblin tribe. 
Stantmont, however, waved a finger. “Your perspective is too limited. It’s true we can’t mobilize our troops easily, but what if we sent part of them to Bright Town as reinforcements?” 
Each person of count rank could mobilize up to five thousand soldiers, including both cavalry and infantry. 
But Felemon retorted, “His Majesty has already sent a message to Alicenia. She’s already taking action. Do we still need to?” 
“That’s not the way to look at it. There are always ways around things. Have your son tell His Majesty that the goblins are numerous and very powerful. Each of us can mobilize a thousand soldiers. Even a Goblin Overlord would be eliminated!” Stantmont said with a sinister smile. 
The families’ honor had to be restored as soon as possible. 
Most importantly, Cecil had said that Loder was still alive! He couldn’t just let him continue living without saving him. 
The scene fell silent for a moment. 
Felemon sighed deeply. “Alright, don’t think I don’t know what you’re planning. You useless thing! Go get cleaned up and come with me to see the king!” 
In the end. 
The Lionheart Emperor approved their request, but they couldn’t mobilize the Imperial Knights, who were of higher strength. 
This meant they could only muster forces from their own families for capable combat power. 
“Hmph, two thousand elite soldiers, and we still can’t take down a goblin tribe? Loder, Loder, if you were dead, I wouldn’t have to go to such lengths!” 
Stantmont muttered coldly, gathering soldiers with Felemon and preparing to set off. 
… 
Elsewhere, 
The Beast Goblin, under Goblin Slayer’s command, was already heading toward the enchanted forest in the far west. 
Since it wasn’t very far, he could reach it by running for ten days. 
From a distance, he could see the sky ahead was extremely dark, as if the sunlight above had been sliced away, unable to penetrate. 
This was the largest enchanted forest on the continent. 
The Beast King Tribe wasn’t a particularly powerful monster force. 
They could only reside on the outskirts of the enchanted forest. 
It wasn’t long before the Beast Goblin reached the outskirts of the tribe. 
This tribe occupied an entire valley and was quite expansive, with about two thousand low-level goblins, three hundred big variants, twenty hero variants, one mutant variant, and one leader variant. 
Outside, it was considered a super-large tribe. 
But within this enchanted forest, it didn’t rank highly and was often bullied by the surrounding monsters.
