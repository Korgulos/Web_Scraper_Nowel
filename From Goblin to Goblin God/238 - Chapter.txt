Chapter 238: Choosing a Concubine in the Capital? 
TL: Sungmin  
The goblins could be set aside for now. 
The focus turned to Alice, One-Eyed Owl, Gobu Yue, Lia, Goblin Slayer, Osius, and Grugia. 
First, Lin Tian called Gobu Yue over. 
[Gobu Yue: Lv100<br/>

Lin Tian frowned when he saw her combat power—too weak. 
This was because she was a female goblin. 
Unable to raise her limits through mating, it was already quite remarkable that she had reached this level. 
The Tear of God was a world-class magic tool he had given her earlier. When she sustained fatal damage, it would form a teardrop-shaped shield, which was incredibly durable. 
“Boss, I’ll continue improving my puppet magic. By then, I’ll surely be of more help,” Gobu Yue said, pounding her small head, looking very guilty. 
She had noticed Lin Tian’s furrowed brow. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian’s eyes brightened as a thought occurred to him. He quickly reassured her, “Little Yue, even if you slow me down, I’d never blame you. Besides, in the Barren Rock Wasteland, your contributions were always at the forefront.” 
In the beginning, had he not forcefully taken Gobu Yue, he would never have had the opportunity to grow as strong as he had. 
It was only thanks to Gobu Yue being a docile creature who didn’t know how to resist. 
“Your combat power may be low now, but your unique talents have limitless potential. Here, I’ve collected a ton of world-class magic. Take it and study.” 
Lin Tian took out a large number of ancient, moldy magic books from his spatial ring. 
More than a hundred in total! 
Learning them all was impossible, but even mastering a few could greatly enhance her combat power. 
He had obtained these from the magical kingdoms and the treasure troves of overthrown realms. 
When these spells were originally created, they were designed to prevent monsters from learning them. 
But Gobu Yue was special—she could learn human magic and grasp it very quickly. 
Within a year, her power could rise above 15,000. 
Seeing this, Gobu Yue was pleasantly surprised. “Thank you, Boss!” 
“Thank me for what? Oh, by the way, I’ll tell you a little trick—our goblin-exclusive ability. You can devour flesh to instantly recover mana. If you run out of potions, just make use of what’s around you.” Lin Tian spoke in a seasoned tone. 
It was a technique he’d learned from Goblin Slayer—very practical. 
In fact, many goblins themselves hadn’t realized this technique. 
The stronger the flesh consumed, the more mana would be restored. 
For instance, during the battle in the Queen’s Palace, when he devoured the Zerg King’s corpse, he had saved several pieces of it for later use. 
That was why, in the fight against the angel Javier, he was able to use skills continuously. 
Goblins, by nature, had pathetically small amounts of mana. 
But with this trick, he could significantly boost his combat power beyond the stats on paper. 
Gobu Yue listened intently, fascinated. “So that’s why, Boss! I always wondered why you ate something mid-fight. I thought you were just hungry!” 
Lin Tian pondered for a moment, “Right. I remember Goblin Slayer is a half-human, half-goblin hybrid. I think she can also learn human magic. Take these books and study with her.” 
Goblin Slayer’s combat power was currently low, only around 4,000. She mostly handled internal affairs in the empire with Lia and the others. 
But being a half-human, half-goblin, she too had limitless potential. 
Unlike typical hybrids, she was the first human ever born from a human and a goblin. 
She could also quickly recover strength by devouring flesh and could learn human magic as well. 
The combination of the two made her a force to be reckoned with. 
For a mage, the greatest limitation wasn’t offense or defense, as they had defensive spells too. 
The real limitation was mana. 
There were only so many potions one could carry, and the more you drank, the weaker their effect became. 
But in battle, the one thing that was never lacking was corpses. 
It was like having an endless supply of mana potions—tired? Hungry? Take a bite, and you’re back in top form. 
“Alright, Boss, I’ll go now. I can’t wait to dive into these spells!” Gobu Yue wobbled away excitedly, clutching a stack of magic books piled so high they nearly touched the ceiling. 
… 
“Kid, I hear you’re planning to help me raise my combat power?” 
Inside the Goblin Palace, the One-Eyed Owl crossed her arms, her breasts nearly spilling out of her revealing outfit due to her voluptuous figure. 
Behind her stood Osius and the rest of the Dragon Slayer Guild members. 
Lin Tian straightened up, “Big Sis, what’s the matter? Wanna test me? My strength isn’t what it used to be.” 
Unexpectedly, One-Eyed Owl didn’t get mad this time. 
She provocatively challenged him instead, “Oh really? If you’ve got the guts, don’t leave tonight. Let’s have a real showdown.” 
“Bring it on!” Lin Tian snorted coldly, eager to test the power of his newly transplanted demigod kidney. 
“Brother Tian, Big Sis, stop fooling around. Tell me how we can get stronger!” Osius eagerly interjected. 
After witnessing Javier’s overwhelming strength, they all realized how weak they were. Their desire to grow stronger had never been more intense. 
Lin Tian glanced outside. “Don’t be hasty. We’re still waiting on one more person.” 
An old man with a white beard and a flushed face walked in slowly from outside. “What’s with all the commotion? I was just about to head to the Bunny Bar for a good drink!” 
“Master Bill, you’re finally here,” Lin Tian said. 
After all, when it came to boosting combat power, the help of a dwarf was indispensable. 
At this point, improving one’s own strength was difficult, but upgrading equipment was still a viable option. 
Bill froze for a moment, sobering up as he felt uneasy. “Why are you looking at me like that?” 
“Oh, nothing. Please, have a seat,” Lin Tian replied with a sly grin. With a wave of his hand, he called over Bill’s favorite bunny girl. 
Seeing such a dreamlike scene unfold, Bill grew more uneasy. “Something’s off… This is a setup, isn’t it? Emperor Lin Tian, just tell me what you want from me! This suspense is killing me.” 
Lin Tian laughed heartily. “Master, you’re still as straightforward as ever. I wanted to ask about crafting Sun-Class magical equipment…” 
At the mention of “Sun-Class,” everyone stiffened. 
The rarity of Sun-Class gear was such that owning one could practically make someone a king or conqueror. 
For a Demon King-level creature, having such a weapon could make them as strong as a grand Demon King. 
Even at its weakest, it would add at least 3,000 points to one’s overall combat power! 
However, Bill’s face changed, and he said gravely, “Emperor Lin Tian, I might disappoint you. I can’t forge Sun-Class gear…” 
“How is that possible? Put in some extra effort! You’re the most skilled blacksmith of the dwarves. Didn’t you casually forge my Half-Moon-class Spear of Zeus?” Lin Tian teased. 
Then, with a twinkle in his eye, he added, “If you’re willing to forge a few pieces of Sun-Class equipment for me, I’ll grant you the chance to choose a concubine during the royal selection in the capital! Whoever you fancy will be yours, no limits on race!” 
“Woah!!” Osius, Grugia, and the others shouted in excitement. Their reactions were far more intense than when they heard about the Sun-Class equipment. 
Clearly, for men, the ultimate dream wasn’t just weapons and swords—it was something else entirely. 
Bill’s eyes sparkled, practically glowing, but he hesitated and said, “Sigh… My master was the real expert, able to craft Sun-Class gear. Among his seven apprentices, I was the slowest and the laziest, always drinking… 
Perhaps, if I hadn’t been like that, I’d have died long ago too. 
Over a hundred years ago, my master and his apprentices were invited to a demigod empire to craft magical gear. On the way there, they were intercepted by an alliance and captured. None were ever heard from again…” 
The mood in the hall grew somber. 
One-Eyed Owl spoke solemnly, “Your master? I’ve heard about that incident. Could it be… the one known as Otto, the Living Forge Master?” 
“Yes, that’s him. He was a true pureblood dwarf. After that incident, I returned to my current tribe and narrowly escaped death. Pureblood dwarves were nearly wiped out, hunted down and slaughtered by humans…” 
Bill’s voice was filled with both helplessness and relief. 
Helpless at his lack of skill, yet grateful for his love of alcohol that kept him alive. 
At this point, Lin Tian had to abandon the idea of crafting Sun-Class equipment. 
But then something occurred to him. “Wait, if I give you a Sun-Class piece as a reference, could you forge others from it? If that doesn’t work, I could provide you with top-tier ore to try.” 
Upon hearing this, Bill’s face turned bitter. “Your Majesty, that’s a bit insulting. Sure, I might be Otto’s worst disciple, but I’m still one of the top ten blacksmiths in the world!” 
“Give me a Sun-Class item to study, and top-tier ore for materials, and I can absolutely craft Sun-Class gear!” 
Seeing his confidence, Lin Tian immediately ordered Sara to retrieve the Sun-Class item from the treasure trove of the Troy Empire. 
He then returned to the matter at hand. “Alright then, Master. When the time comes, please help Big Sis craft a set of Sun-Class armor and weapons.” 
One-Eyed Owl’s abilities had nearly reached their peak, so her power would have to be increased through her equipment. 
“No problem. What kind of weapon would you like?” Bill asked. 
Without hesitation, One-Eyed Owl responded, “Gauntlets are best suited for me!” 
But Lin Tian cut her off. “Hold on. While gauntlets do enhance your strength, they don’t fully utilize your true potential. Here, I’ve got a blueprint for you. Follow this design.” 
He handed Bill a blueprint for a brass knuckle style weapon. 
While gauntlets certainly boosted strength, in terms of lethality, they weren’t as effective as brass knuckles. 
Brass knuckles would focus the power into a single, more violent point, making the output even deadlier. 
“Such a strange weapon! But looking at the theory, it definitely seems stronger than gauntlets!” Bill remarked, surprised. 
After all, this was a modern weapon, and no one in this world had invented it yet. 
One-Eyed Owl was thrilled. “You’ve really got something, kid! Is this weapon your own invention?! It’s perfect for me!” 
As she said that, she rushed forward and gave Lin Tian a tight hug.
