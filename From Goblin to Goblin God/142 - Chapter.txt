Chapter 142: No Survivors!!! 
TL: Sungmin 
Lin Tian felt helpless for a moment. “Can you guys think of a way to save me? Why are we going to the museum?” 
The One-Eyed Owl conceded, but not completely. 
She just wanted to save face in front of Lin Tian with the spoils of war. 
It was like someone who loved to brag after getting drunk. 
“Swish!” 
At this moment, Osius quickly followed up, his face showing an expression more terrifying than a goblin’s. “You better not take advantage of our Big Sis! Otherwise… we’ll use you as fertilizer!!” 
“Not this, brother. She’s so big, where else could I put my head? Should I hold it in my hands instead?” 
Lin Tian stuck close to the One-Eyed Owl and said irritably. 
He had struggled, after all. 
If she weren’t so large, able to ease a lot of the arm strength, he would have been strangled to death. 
He could only endure the pain and pleasure of being forcibly taken to the museum. 
Since it was already night, the museum was closed. 
There were no other people. 
“Someone, unlock the door!” 
The One-Eyed Owl mumbled in a daze. 
Osius quickly and respectfully walked to the museum door, taking out the key. 
“Click!” 
The key hadn’t even been inserted yet, and the One-Eyed Owl had already pushed the door open. 
It managed to push down these massive, thousand-pound giant anti-theft iron doors. 
Leaving only the members of the Dragon Slayer Guild in a mess in the wind. 
Lin Tian was dragged to the top floor. 
Along the way, he was indeed astonished by the various monster specimens! 
“So many high-tier monsters, and even an ancient dragon skull! No wonder they can exist within a super empire without being subordinate to it…” 
When he reached the top floor. 
He was even more shocked to see the specimens of numerous twelfth-tier monsters, unable to close his mouth in awe! 
Just dealing with one Veronica had exhausted him. 
So many of them, all twelfth-tier like Veronica. 
Were all dealt with by this drunk woman before him?! 
Incredible! 
“Look, nine years ago I challenged the crystal dragon. Unfortunately, I didn’t win, and it scratched my eye blind, but I still dug out a large piece of the core dragon crystal! If it were now, I’d handle it in three moves. You believe me?” The One-Eyed Owl gestured and spoke, looking down at Lin Tian. 
Forehead to forehead. 
He could still smell the alcohol on her breath. 
Lin Tian nodded repeatedly, “I believe, I believe!” 
It was like those times when he accompanied an elder, who would get drunk and pull him aside to chat. 
If you dared to say you didn’t believe, they’d drag the conversation on even longer. 
The One-Eyed Owl laughed with satisfaction, “Hahaha! Good that you believe! I acknowledge you for drinking. But in terms of fighting skills, you might not match up to me.” 
“Ah, yes, yes.” Lin Tian responded perfunctorily. 
“Honest! I like people like you!” The One-Eyed Owl gave a thumbs up, then pulled Lin Tian along like a long-lost brother. 
She began to introduce those specimens, recounting past events. 
“Look, the arm of the King of Destruction. That guy was said to have city-destroying strength. Guess how I took its arm off?” 
“I don’t know…” 
“Of course, by arm-wrestling, silly!” 
“Hahaha…” 
Lin Tian was speechless, finally understanding why drunkards were so annoying. 
However, he needed to figure out how to get that dragon crystal! 
That was definitely what Little Black needed, the key item to fully revive the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother. 
After following the One-Eyed Owl’s bragging for a while. 
Lin Tian pointed to the center, “Big Sis, that thing is useless to you, right? How about giving it to me as a keepsake?” 
“No.” 
However, just after praising her to the skies, she immediately changed her expression. 
He was decisively rejected. 
Osius explained from behind, “Our Dragon Slayer Guild has a rule: trophies cannot be given as gifts. It’s a disgraceful act for the weak to disguise themselves. You must defeat the opponent once, and then the loser can give the trophy to the winner.” 
“That’s right, you little runt, don’t even think about it. You can’t beat me, hahaha!” The One-Eyed Owl laughed childishly, her face full of mischief. 
Lin Tian frowned. 
This shitty guild had so many troublesome rules. He should have just stolen it from the beginning. 
It would have saved him from this annoying drunkard. 
But he couldn’t break free. 
Then the One-Eyed Owl changed her tone, patting her chest, “But don’t worry, since you beat me in drinking, I can help you improve your strength, and then you can try to defeat me!” 
She didn’t realize that when she tried to pat her chest, she ended up slapping Lin Tian’s face. 
It made him want to bite her, but who would argue with a drunk? 
Hearing this, his eyes lit up, “Help me improve my strength? Sure!” 
“From now on, you’re a member of our Dragon Slayer Guild!” 
The One-Eyed Owl raised her voice, as if announcing it to everyone else. 
Osius’s expression changed. “Big Sis! Are you serious? He looks like an ordinary person. Joining the Dragon Slayer Guild goes against the rules, doesn’t it?” 
“Do you have any objections?” 
The One-Eyed Owl staggered over to Osius, clenching her fists, 
The thunderous sound of muscles tightening crackled! 
Osius swallowed hard. “I was just using spirit communication, talking to ghosts, Big Sis. Don’t misunderstand.” 
After some more rambling and fussing. 
Lin Tian heard a snoring sound by his ear. 
And there was drool dripping on his head. 
It was hard to imagine that this was a woman! 
“Kid, now that you’re a member of our guild, quickly help the Big Sis back to rest!” Osius said irritably, with a mischievous grin. 
He planned to boss him around in the future. 
Lin Tian had no choice. As a member of the Dragon Slayer Guild, he had to help her back. 
After all, once she woke up, he intended to marry her. 
If these guys took advantage of her, he would suffer a huge loss. 
Back at the guild. 
The One-Eyed Owl lay back on the sofa, snoring loudly. Lin Tian was exhausted and out of breath. 
He never imagined a woman could be so heavy. 
It was no wonder, with all those muscles and a tall build, she didn’t gain it in vain. 
Everyone else went to rest as well. 
They didn’t pay much attention to Lin Tian joining the Dragon Slayer Guild; rather, many were quite impressed. 
He was the first man in history to drink the One-Eyed Owl under the table! 
But they didn’t express it much. 
After all, they’d seen many big waves. Drinking was just a pastime. 
Something they sought out daily. 
At this moment, Osius spoke, “Find a place to sleep tonight. I’ll arrange a room for you tomorrow.” 
After saying that, he left the hall. 
Lin Tian took this chance to sneak into the museum. 
“Hmph, if not now, then when?” 
The door had already been broken by the One-Eyed Owl, a perfect opportunity. 
He snuck up to the top floor, immediately taking out his space ring and placing the dragon crystal inside. 
The shimmering white and purple light made it look like a masterfully crafted gem. 
Touching it, he could feel the powerful magic contained within. 
It was indeed the core dragon crystal of a crystal dragon. 
Taking another look at the surrounding specimens, Lin Tian examined them carefully. 
If he only stole the dragon crystal, it would be obvious to anyone that he did it, since he had expressed interest before. 
But if he stole a few larger specimens as well, it wouldn’t be suspicious. 
After all, who would know that Lin Tian had a spatial ring? They’d think it impossible for a normal person to carry or hide so many large items, assuming they were stolen by someone else. 
After looking around for a while, he took two dragon head specimens and a large twelfth-tier monster corpse specimen. 
These things were valuable experience. 
Lin Tian decided to take advantage of the situation and devour several twelfth-tier monster specimens on the spot. 
He broke through to level ninety-five! 
“Specimen of the Lightning Phantom, specimen of the Black-winged Banshee, specimen of the Insect Emperor…” 
“Never thought I could catch such a big break. Goblins do have their perks; as long as there are corpses, devouring them can lead to leveling up, hehe.” 
Lin Tian devoured them one after another, unable to stop! 
So many twelfth-tier monsters, each providing a significant amount of experience! 
Unfortunately, if they were alive, Lin Tian could also choose a few females to enhance his abilities further. 
Compared to these guys, his combat power at the same level was far inferior. 
However, raising his level was urgent. 
Anubis’s soul siphoning could execute opponents five levels below him. 
96… 
97… 
98… 
99… 
100…! 
Finally, he reached level one hundred! 
Lin Tian felt nervous, unsure if he could continue leveling up. “Gobu Yue, Gobu Yue, I just want to know if you can really fulfill the legend, and allow me to become a god…” 
He continued consuming the remaining specimens. 
Feeling extremely anxious. 
101…! 
Finally! 
As Lin Tian devoured all the spoils on the fourth floor, his level surpassed one hundred! 
He had exceeded the limit of ordinary people on this continent! 
As far as he knew, for ordinary people or monsters, the level cap was one hundred. 
Only gods, demigods, or those with a trace of divine blood could continue leveling up beyond one hundred. 
The purer the bloodline, the higher the level cap. 
Take the One-Eyed Owl, for example. She was a demigod’s descendant, possibly reaching one hundred fifty or even two hundred. 
But never higher than a demigod. 
The bloodline concentration determined it. 
Lin Tian felt incredibly excited, feeling a newfound affection for Gobu Yue. 
However, he quickly packed up and left the place. 
These specimens were like jerky, tough to eat, and he had almost eaten until dawn. 
If he didn’t leave soon, he’d be exposed. 
Even if he directly left this city, his strength breaking through to 9,000, this trip was not in vain! 
But leaving would be a dead giveaway. 
He had to stay in the Dragon Slayer Guild to observe. 
Returning to the hall. 
The One-Eyed Owl was still snoring, and the others, after several nights of drinking, were sleeping more soundly than anyone. 
Lin Tian also lay on the table to catch a nap. 
“Wake up, kid. Big Sis isn’t awake yet. Nothing happened last night, right?” 
A cold voice sounded in his ear. 
It was Osius. 
Lin Tian groggily opened his eyes and ignored him. 
Osius didn’t bother either and looked towards the One-Eyed Owl on the sofa. Her soaked pants needed to be changed, or they’d start to stink. 
He had to take the risk. 
To wake the One-Eyed Owl. 
But he had to call the others too. If he was going to die, they should all die together; otherwise, it would be too unfair. 
“Damn, Osius, you’re really bad. If you want to die, don’t drag us with you. Who dares to disturb the Big Sis’s sleep?” A man said irritably. 
Osius had no choice, “Our Dragon Slayer Guild may be lax, but we need our reputation outside. If Big Sis goes out in those pants and someone sees, where would we put our face?” 
“You’re right, but it’s up to you.” 
Looking at the sleeping One-Eyed Owl, Osius gathered his courage and gently shook her. 
After a while, 
The One-Eyed Owl slowly opened her eyes and stretched lazily, “Osius? Where’s that kid? Did I lose to him in drinking last night?” 
She felt very calm now, having just experienced failure. 
She wasn’t too upset. 
“He’s sleeping too.” Osius respectfully yet puzzledly said. 
He didn’t understand why the One-Eyed Owl didn’t have her usual morning grumpiness, “Alright, I embarrassed myself. Wake him up and ask what he wants.” 
She yawned as she spoke. 
Knowing she lost the drinking contest, she wasn’t in the mood to get angry. 
She just felt she’d let everyone down. 
“Big Sis, before that, I think you should change your pants first. Yesterday…” 
Osius stammered, afraid to be too direct. 
People cherish their lives, after all. 
Hearing this. 
The One-Eyed Owl looked down in confusion, seeing something sticky and damp, “Really? Did I get so drunk that I spilled the wine?” 
When she said this, the One-Eyed Owl’s voice was slightly shaky. 
She seemed a bit nervous. 
“No, Big Sis, it’s… you… you wet your pants…” 
Osius explained with concern. 
Stunned! 
When he looked at the One-Eyed Owl, he was almost scared to death, stumbling back a few steps. 
The members of the Dragon Slayer Guild also turned pale with fright. 
That familiar look! 
It was the one the One-Eyed Owl showed when she was about to hunt! 
Her whole body released a visible red aura, burning like flames. 
But this time, the One-Eyed Owl’s face was grim, almost dripping black. 
Filled with unprecedented killing intent! 
“Osius, Osius, why do you cherish your life so little? I was thinking of sparing one of you…” 
“Heh…” 
“It seems, I have to kill you all to keep the secret…”
