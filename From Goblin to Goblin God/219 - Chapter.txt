Chapter 219: Sun-Class Magic Tool, Millennial Eye 
TL: Sungmin  
The land of yellow sand. 
At a glance, it seemed as if there was no difference at all. 
If not for the distant rising dunes, it would be easy to get lost here. 
“Swish!” 
In the sky, a massive shadow flashed by, blocking out the sun, bringing with it a fierce wind. 
It was a dragon. 
To the small animals struggling to survive in this yellow sand, it brought a bit of coolness. 
A pale yellow desert lizard closed its eyes in delight, feeling incredibly comfortable. 
But then— 
With a loud “smack,” it was stomped into the sand by a green armored foot, face-first. 
A massive army of goblins surged forth! 
All were clad in polished armor, with an average level of 50, each boasting over a dozen innate skills! 
Their vast force moved like a tidal wave, leaving darkness in its wake, and even the yellow sand was tainted by the saturation of magic. 
Thanks to Lin Tian’s economic development, there was enough money to forge armor and weapons. 
Three hundred thousand elite soldiers, averaging level 50, could already rival the forces of the semi-divine empires beyond the Uninhabited Zone. 
But it wasn’t enough—Lin Tian wanted to step out with an overwhelming, crushing force. 
Though the weather was unbearably hot, the goblin army included mutant ‘ice’ goblins, capable of releasing cold air. 
This prevented them from being roasted alive in their armor. 
This was one of the reasons why the Troy Empire was so powerful—foreign troops had trouble even making it to their lands. 
In the sky. 
From a distance, Lin Tian finally spotted a massive oasis, with a large city built within. 
It was undoubtedly the Troy Empire. 
Immediately, Lin Tian rode his Purple-Gold Dragon Mother to scout the situation. 
Upon hearing the flapping of dragon wings and the overwhelming surge of magic energy, the people of the Troy Empire grew alarmed and began preparing for battle. 
There was no specific military force. 
Everyone was a soldier! 
Even the king came to the city wall, his face full of disdain. “I knew you’d come, damn goblin! Where’s your army? Could it be they’ve already died from the heat in the sand, hahahaha!” 
“Hmph, I’m just here to give you a warning. If you surrender, I’ll give you a chance to live. If you resist, I won’t hesitate to kill you all!” Lin Tian said. 
Gazing into the city, he estimated there were roughly over a million people. 
Not a large number, but every family had someone capable of using Hero’s Power. 
Though they weren’t as formidable as those who had followed Sara, they were still of elite monster strength. 
Upon hearing Lin Tian’s threatening words, the Trojans showed no fear; instead, they burst into laughter. 
“Hahaha! You ugly goblin, you’ve threatened the wrong people! I’m a Trojan!” 
“Your Trojan father doesn’t even know how to spell the word ‘surrender’!” 
“Don’t think that just because you’re riding a dragon, you’re something bigger than it! You’ll always just be a lowly monster!” 
“Surrender? Maybe if you kneel down and beg us, we might consider it!” 
At that moment, the King of Troy also spoke loudly, “The glorious Trojans will never surrender to monsters! Goblin, we are ready to fight you! If you dare, come at us!!!” 
The entire city burst into an uproar! 
Battle intent surged, matching the intensity of the scorching, sand-filled heat! 
Lin Tian merely chuckled disdainfully, “Alright, I hope you can remain so proud in a moment, and live up to your so-called glory!” 
“Hm?” 
Suddenly. 
The king’s brow furrowed, his gaze focusing on the distance where the heat waves twisted the horizon, now obscured by a black mass. 
He couldn’t make out what it was. 
In the sky, countless specks were rapidly approaching. 
Closer and closer. 
Finally, he saw it clearly! 
“Prepare for battle! Prepare for battle!!!” The king roared, his voice cracking with panic, veins bulging on his forehead! 
Hearing the urgency in his voice, the Trojans climbed the city walls, tall buildings, or went outside to check the situation. 
On a statue, a thin man climbed up, confusion written all over his face. 
But when he looked up, it was as if someone had poured a bucket of cold water over him! 
His nerves tensed! 
“How is this possible?!” 
Shocked beyond words, he tumbled from the statue, falling more than ten meters to the ground. 
Yet he ignored the pain, his face filled with terror. 
People gathered around, asking, “What’s going on outside?!” 
“Dragons, a sky full of dragons! Strange iron machines! And goblins—countless goblins! They’re coming, they’re all coming!” 
The arrogance he once had, the pride he once held. 
At this moment, it all seemed to vanish. 
He even felt like crying! 
The difference in power was too overwhelming—so staggering that it left people in utter despair. 
Upon hearing this, the crowd still seemed half-doubtful. 
The king’s face had already turned ashen, shocked as he exclaimed, “How is this possible? Hundreds of thousands of elite soldiers! How could you possibly have that many soldiers? And more importantly, how did you even get them here?” 
In such a short time, Lin Tian had amassed three hundred thousand elite, fully-equipped soldiers. 
It was nothing short of a miracle! 
What kind of immense wealth could accomplish this? The Troy Empire was already struggling to arm each soldier with a weapon, given how impoverished the land was. 
“So these are dragons… Could what the High Priestess said be true? And the dwarves, they possess such overwhelming power…”  
The king’s pupils trembled as if unable to process the vast amount of information. 
Even from afar, with everything in plain sight, the impact was just too much to bear. 
The sight of the dragons alone was far beyond anyone’s imagination. 
And the steel machines created by the dwarves? They seemed utterly unstoppable! 
It wasn’t just him. 
The Trojans who saw this with their own eyes were all rendered speechless in fear! 
The so-called aura of glory had completely vanished; if they weren’t forcing themselves to hold on, or if they had somewhere to run, they would have fled long ago! 
Not much later. 
The dragons arrived first, soaring over the city! 
They created a real-life ‘dragon’ whirlwind, circling endlessly, their presence pressing down on the entire city like a weight from the heavens! 
Even the flies didn’t dare to move, lying flat on the ground. 
The low growls of the dragons were like whispers of death! 
“This, this is a dragon! What kind of person would have the courage to even try to slay one?” 
“Such evil and terrifying creatures… Now I finally understand!” 
“Damn it, stay strong! It’s just a few dragons! We have Hero’s Power, which grants us immunity to a lot of fire damage!” 
“But, look outside…” 
When everyone saw the dense army of elite goblins approaching the city, true despair began to spread! 
In that moment, glory meant nothing. Foolish sacrifice was nothing more than stupidity! 
One by one, the expressions of the Trojans turned to panic, and they couldn’t stop trembling. 
This was the feeling of awaiting death. 
The King of Troy finally calmed himself after a long silence. “Everyone, follow me! We will resist to the end! The Millennial Eye will protect us!” 
With that, he raised the golden, triangular-shaped magic tool high! 
It burst with endless light, enveloping the entire Troy Empire! 
It blocked all external attacks. 
The most absurd part was that they could still attack from within! 
This was the strength of a Sun-class magic tool. It gave off the same impression as an overpowered in-game item, one that disrupted the balance due to its insane stats. 
“So it turns out it’s just a defensive magic tool?” 
Lin Tian felt a bit relieved, at least knowing he wouldn’t be caught off guard initially. 
He then sneered, “Hmph, so the so-called glorious Trojans are just going to hide like turtles in their shells?” 
The king looked disdainfully at Lin Tian. “Turtle in a shell? You clearly don’t understand the true power of the Millennial Eye!” 
As he spoke, he began to form a magical array in his hands. “World-Class Magic: Sandstorm Giant!” 
“Sssss!” 
As the magical array solidified, large amounts of yellow sand began to stir, forming into a massive sand giant. 
It was nearly a thousand meters tall—truly awe-inspiring. 
The most terrifying part was that the sand giant was immortal. Even if it was destroyed, it would immediately reform. 
As long as the caster had enough magic power. 
The king quickly ordered, “Everyone, help me channel magic power! We’ll wear them down first!” 
Nervously, the people stepped forward to assist. 
But in the very next moment. 
Five war machines opened their gaping maws and began devouring the sand giant. 
In no time, it was eaten clean, making it impossible to reform. 
“Hahaha! Tricks like that won’t work in front of us dwarves!” Bill sneered. 
Ever since the first war machine had shown such impressive results in combat, Bill had teamed up with other dwarven craftsmen to build five more. 
After all, with the funding of the Goblin Empire, they could afford to be extravagant. 
Seeing this, the King of Troy’s face darkened again. He desperately tried to reassure himself, knowing that the Millennial Eye still protected them. 
No need to worry too much. 
He then taunted, “Don’t be too arrogant! With the Millennial Eye here, what can you do to me?” 
Upon hearing this. 
Lin Tian knew the time had come. The king was entirely fixated on the Millennial Eye. 
A flash of light appeared in Lin Tian’s hand. 
Lucky Steal activated! 
“Congratulations, you have gained a feeling of ‘fear of death.’ Would you like to take it?” 
Huh? 
Lin Tian was momentarily stunned, then cursed, “Hmph, what a joke this Trojan glory is! Even their king is scared to death! Since you’ve chosen to resist, now you must face the consequences!” 
“You—!” 
The King of Troy’s expression shifted, as though his worst fear had been exposed, but he was too shaken to respond. 
With a single command from Lin Tian. 
The dragons, the goblin army, and the dwarves all launched a ferocious assault! 
Though the Millennial Eye was powerful, its defensive capacity was still limited. 
Under the barrage of attacks. 
Especially from the dragons’ flames. 
The Trojans inside the city could barely see anything outside, with the onslaught looming just beyond, the defensive barrier ready to collapse at any moment. 
The impending sense of doom overwhelmed their hearts! 
Once the defense of the Millennial Eye collapsed, the relentless and concentrated attacks would directly fall upon them. 
Without any high-level combat strength, they were nothing more than lambs awaiting slaughter. 
The King of Troy was already on the verge of despair. His most powerful attack had been countered with a single move, and now, the tide had turned against him completely. 
“Your Majesty, give it up. This is an inevitable conclusion. The stage now belongs to the goblins. If you choose to surrender, perhaps it will make things easier for everyone,” the High Priestess said, her voice shaky as she hobbled over. 
Her tone was heavy with meaning. 
As the elder of the empire, she couldn’t act recklessly in such a dire situation. 
But she wasn’t the king, and her words ultimately didn’t hold the final say. 
The king roared angrily, “Nonsense! An inevitable conclusion? We haven’t even fought back yet! If we die, we die pursuing glory! My people, the Millennial Eye won’t hold much longer—fight with all you’ve got!!!” 
“What!?” 
The crowd’s expressions changed drastically. 
But before they had time to think, they heard a resounding crack! 
The sky-high defense shattered. 
The golden glow of the Millennial Eye faded, falling to the ground like scrap metal. 
“Charge!!!” 
With the roar of Gobu Kuang leading the charge, a million goblins stormed the city! 
The war machines rolled in, crushing everything in their path. City walls and buildings crumbled into ruins in an instant! 
The sounds of battle cries, the deafening roar of machinery, and the terrifying growls of the dragons echoed through the city! 
All of it combined into an overwhelming cacophony that left the Trojans in stunned silence, their minds blank, unsure of what to do! 
It wasn’t until the goblin blades pierced their chests that they finally reacted, desperately trying to fight back.
