Chapter 60: Church Support, Holy Cross Guardian! 
TL: Sungmin  
Taking advantage of the Sword Saintess’s moment of recovery. 
Lin Tian raised his short sword, ready to stab her in the abdominal wound. 
Unexpectedly, she managed to perform a somersault, kicking Lin Tian away with one swift move. 
Fortunately, Lin Tian blocked with his short sword, only sliding a short distance from the impact. 
She was truly difficult to deal with, even though her strength had dropped to around 2500. 
She was still so formidable. 
As they say, a starved camel is still bigger than a horse. 
Lin Tian quickly closed the distance again, and when he was close enough, he used the skill “Brutal Roar!” 
The nearby soldiers were instantly shaken to death. 
The Sword Saintess also faltered for a moment but then activated the skill “Holy Sword Intent!” 
Surrounding sword energy around her body suddenly dissipated, bringing her consciousness back. 
She hastily blocked Lin Tian’s surprise attack. 
She even counterattacked, injuring Lin Tian with a reverse sword strike. 
Touching the wound on his head where the scalp had been scraped, Lin Tian realized that continuing like this might lead to mutual destruction, or worse, his defeat. 
After all, the Sword Saintess was of the holy attribute, able to suppress him. 
His monster skills had minimal effect on her. 
At this moment, Alicenia’s eyes burned with fury, “Today, we shall end this!” 
Lin Tian smirked coldly, “Do you enjoy the taste of failure? Hmm?” 
“Shut up!” 
Alicenia swung her sword. 
Lin Tian calmly evaded, moving beside a soldier. 
The powerful and cold longsword stopped at the soldier’s neck. 
The soldier was so scared that his legs gave out, trembling and kneeling on the ground. 
“If you have the guts, stop running around! Stand still!” 
Alicenia crazily swung her sword in pursuit. 
Lin Tian kept dodging, knowing he was faster than her, so there was no need to worry. 
He aimed to break Alicenia’s spirit again, then he could use “Blood of Ruin” on her. 
Otherwise, she would block it. 
An hour passed. 
Lin Tian did not attack, just played around. 
He specifically hid behind the soldiers. Every time he was about to be cut, Alicenia had to stop, otherwise, she would kill the soldiers too. 
Many of them were crippled by Lin Tian, unable to escape. 
They could only become his human shields. 
“Kill me, Sword Saintess! Kill me!” 
“Yes, just avenge us! Strike me down!” 
The soldiers cried out in despair and fury. 
Under the influence of their voices, Alicenia froze, her resolve wavered. 
She hesitated! 
She had really thought about cutting them all down together. 
At this moment, the soldier held by Lin Tian pleaded, “Sword Saintess, just take care of my wife and daughter, kill me!” 
“This is boring, let’s call it a day. Anyway, you will end this battle in miserable defeat.” 
Lin Tian spoke with a bored expression. 
Seeing him about to escape. 
Alicenia finally couldn’t bear it, closing her eyes, she slashed down in an instant! 
One sword. 
The soldier was split in half on the spot! 
But Lin Tian dodged just in time, a cold smile curled on his lips, he succeeded! 
If this continued, she would completely lose it. 
In just a few seconds. 
Alicenia had killed several soldiers in a row. 
She felt her eyes being covered in blood, the world turning crimson, with only one thought in her mind, kill! 
Kill them all! 
In a few minutes, all the soldiers were dead by her sword. 
Under the holy sword that protected the empire. 
Lin Tian laughed triumphantly, “Well done, Sword Saintess. You’re much better at killing people than monsters.” 
“Thump!” 
Alicenia regained some clarity, looking at the bloody scene before her, she was completely stunned! 
She couldn’t believe she had done this. 
But looking down. 
The fresh blood on her holy sword was still warm, and she was covered in blood. 
“I-I killed so many… so many people I was supposed to protect…” 
Alicenia’s eyes trembled, questioning herself. 
This was the chance! 
Lin Tian wiped the blood from his head wound, smeared it on his short sword, and launched a sneak attack! 
Piercing through her armor, stabbing into her shoulder. 
Alicenia pushed Lin Tian away forcefully, screaming madly, “I will kill you! Why are you doing this! Why did you kill them!” 
For a moment, it was unclear if she was talking to herself or someone else. 
Just as she prepared to attack again, she felt a sharp pain in her shoulder. 
Under normal circumstances, with adrenaline, she shouldn’t feel such intense pain, but it felt like her heart was being pierced! 
She fell to her knees directly. 
Her strength rapidly waned. 
Moreover, she could feel the holy power within her ebbing away. 
“Lord God, don’t do this to me, it’s not my fault, I will protect everyone, I…” 
Alicenia stretched her hand towards the sky, pleading. 
She thought that God, seeing her slaughter her own people, had stripped her of her powers. 
With the sky covered in dark clouds, she believed even God did not want to look at her. 
Suddenly, Lin Tian appeared in front of her, landing a punch that sent her flying! 
She couldn’t even hold onto her sword, which fell beside her. 
Alicenia did not resist, her heart filled with immense regret, but repentance was useless. 
Her comrades died before her eyes, and her people died by her hand! 
The overwhelming pressure made her head spin. 
At this moment, light rain began to fall. 
In endless pain and guilt, the severely injured Alicenia finally lost consciousness. 
Lin Tian looked at the perfect body before him and felt a pang of sympathy, “Such a strong woman, yet she has fatal weaknesses.” 
Under the suppression of the Blood of Ruin, she wouldn’t wake up for a while. 
Previously. 
Lin Tian had wanted to kill her directly and devour her. 
He definitely wanted to turn her into his plaything, but that was too difficult. 
She would probably commit suicide before letting that happen. 
But now, it might be possible. 
Under the pollution of the Blood of Ruin, the Sword Saintess would lose her holy power. 
If she believed she had been abandoned by God and chose to fall into corruption, he would have his chance. 
“This is far from enough, so let’s plant a seed of corruption in you…” Lin Tian grinned wickedly. 
He tore off her platinum armor, a symbol of purity. 
When all the armor was removed, her snow-white skin, accompanied by a fragrant scent, was exposed to Lin Tian’s gaze. 
Every inch seemed like a masterpiece of craftsmanship. 
Such a body was hard to find in the world. 
In the silent environment, with the gloomy weather. 
Gradually, the rain grew heavier, and as the white skin became stained with dirty mud. 
He believed a pure and noble soul would completely collapse along with the body’s pollution. 
This feeling was something he had never experienced before. 
Compared to others, the Sword Saintess seemed to have something special. 
As Lin Tian was immersed in his thoughts, his heart suddenly felt a sharp pain! 
A sense of extreme danger quietly approached. 
In the distance, Brutal, who had escaped, came rushing back, his face full of fear, almost in tears. 
He hurriedly shouted to Lin Tian, “The Church! The people from the Church are here! Run!” 
Lin Tian asked in surprise, “The Church?” 
“Yes, it’s the Holy Church! A bishop is here!” 
Brutal didn’t even care that Lin Tian had captured the Sword Saintess. 
He ran past him in a panic! 
Under the gray sky. 
Lin Tian saw a group of people slowly approaching from a distance, about a dozen, but it was hard to see clearly in the rain. 
At this moment. 
A sudden thunderclap roared! 
In the flash of lightning, Lin Tian finally saw the newcomers clearly. 
They were tall, all wearing heavy armor, and wielding heavy swords, walking step by step. 
The pattern on their armor was very striking. 
Full of oppressive force! 
A large ‘cross’ symbol indicated the newcomers were the Church’s Holy Cross Guardians! 
Lin Tian finished his last act, then distanced himself, confronting them. 
He didn’t dare to act rashly. 
The bishop of the Holy Cross Guardians looked at the Sword Saintess on the ground and sighed, “I didn’t expect that even she would be in trouble, and it’s just a small goblin…” 
“A weak and harmless appearance, hiding terrifying power and evil, this is a typical demon.” 
The bishop said slowly, placing his heavy sword on the ground with a thud. 
He finally commanded, “Holy Guards, heed my command, in the name of God, offer your strength for peace in this world, expel the demon! Hallelujah!” 
Suddenly! 
Ten Holy Guards charged at Lin Tian in unison! 
They looked heavy, but their speed was incredibly fast! 
The two sides clashed. 
Every strike, Lin Tian could barely block, realizing something was wrong. These guys were much stronger than expected. 
A quick glance at their attributes showed they all had a strength of 3000! 
Terrified, he turned and ran! 
Slashing his palm, he scattered a lot of Blood of Ruin. 
The Holy Guards sensed something wrong with the blood, “Forbidden substance. Don’t chase, that goblin is truly a demon…” 
Lin Tian also fled in the opposite direction, then took a detour. 
“Damn, this is the Church’s power? Even a small soldier has 3000 combat strength, I need to revise my plan!” 
He ran without looking back. 
He ran as far as he could. 
On the ruins of Bright Town, the bishop calmly walked to the Sword Saintess. 
He tore off his red cloak and covered her, lifting her up, “Let’s prepare to return, this child needs the cleansing and guidance of the priest, otherwise, she might fall into corruption.” 
“Bishop, aren’t we dealing with the goblin disaster? And this minotaur corpse, and… Divine Priestess Ifreya…” A Holy Guard asked. 
The bishop looked around, sighed, “We’re already late, bury the bodies. As for Ifreya, the archbishop has already said that God have descended a miracle and chosen a new Divine Priest. We don’t need to search anymore.” 
Hearing this, the Holy Guards understood. 
It was a pity, Ifreya had the best talent among the past Divine Priests. 
She could have possibly become a Saintess. 
Then, they took the Sword Saintess back to the capital. 
Originally, Felomon had requested their help in dealing with the goblins, but the Church was short-handed, so they had come from far away.
