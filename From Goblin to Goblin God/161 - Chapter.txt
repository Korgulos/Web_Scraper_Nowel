Chapter 161: Finding a Way to Evolve · Lin Tian 
TL: Sungmin 
Note: Terminology change—Super Empire changed to Great Empire. 
“What’s the rush? I haven’t had a drink with you yet, kid. You’re not allowed to leave!” 
The One-Eyed Owl pulled Lin Tian close with a playful smile, trying to convince him to stay with a lighthearted approach. 
But Lin Tian had already made up his mind. “We’ll definitely meet again in the future.” 
Hearing this, Osius became flustered. “No, really, you’re leaving? You’re not happy staying with the guild? Though I admit, you haven’t exactly had the best time lately…” 
“Rookie, it was your idea. How can you just leave? Why not stick around a bit longer? Maybe you’ll change your mind,” Grugia chimed in, having recovered from the initial shock, trying to persuade him as well. 
Everyone joined in, urging him to stay. 
Although Lin Tian hadn’t been with them for long, his presence over the past few days had brought many changes to the guild. 
It was no longer just the One-Eyed Owl drinking alone; now everyone joined in. 
He had even helped them survive in Twilight City with Joan of Arc’s aid. 
But Lin Tian shook his head. “I appreciate your concern, but there are some things I need to handle on my own.” 
He then turned to the One-Eyed Owl. “Big Sis, can you teach me something? How long will it take to learn?” 
For a moment, everyone fell into a somber silence. 
The One-Eyed Owl was a bit displeased as well. “This really sucks, but since you’ve decided, there’s nothing I can do. If you learn quickly, it could take three days. If not, you might never learn it in a lifetime.” 
The technique had no level restrictions, so it could be learned quickly or slowly. 
Lin Tian nodded. 
For the next two days, he practiced the breathing technique with the One-Eyed Owl in the square. 
Basically, it was a method to amplify strength and speed, allowing one to maximize their body’s potential in combat. 
For someone like the One-Eyed Owl, this was an incredibly powerful tool. 
For Lin Tian, though, its utility was relatively limited but still essential. 
During this time, Grugia had already passed the news to Patrick, who was expected to attend the Dragon Slayer Guild banquet that night. 
Using the breathing technique, Lin Tian found that the strength of his body alone was now enough to shatter rocks with his bare hands. 
He moved with the swiftness of a flying swallow. 
Overall, his power had increased by over 100%. 
He then checked his attribute panel. 
[Lin Tian: Lv100<br/>
Race: Goblin<br/>
Profession: None<br/>
Titles: Blasphemer, Potential God, God’s Blessing,…<br/>
Health: 2400<br/>
Strength: 840<br/>
Defense: 1010<br/>
Skills: Lucky Steal, Anubis’ Soul Drain, Abnormal Fusion, Blood of Ruin, Ruinous Howl, No-Blade Capture, Keen…<br/>
Equipment: Spear of Thor, Elemental Crossbow, Life Armor<br/>
Overall Power: 9500] 
Everything else remained unchanged, including the skills panel. 
The breathing technique didn’t count as a skill. 
However, his overall combat power had increased from just below 9000 to 9500! 
He had gained a full 500 points in combat power. 
Unfortunately, he still couldn’t compare to the One-Eyed Owl. 
As a weak goblin, it was only thanks to three pieces of world-class magic equipment and the attributes he had gained from mating with so many powerful beings that he had this level of strength. 
Unless he could evolve again, he couldn’t break the 10,000 mark. 
Looking at it this way, his next focus couldn’t be on combat techniques or equipment. 
Instead, he needed to find a way to evolve! 
Lin Tian then expressed his gratitude. “Big Sis, thank you for your guidance. I can clearly feel that my strength has increased.” 
“You have a good combat talent, but you still need a lot of practice. Why not spar with me before you leave?” The One-Eyed Owl grinned mischievously. 
Lin Tian quickly waved his hands. “No need, no need, I’ll practice hard…” 
But the One-Eyed Owl wasn’t willing to give up so easily. “Oh come on, give it a try. I promise I won’t beat you half to death so you can’t leave the guild.” 
Good grief. 
She wasn’t even trying to hide it anymore, was she? 
Lin Tian was about to formally say goodbye to everyone when they suddenly heard the sound of galloping hooves outside. “Is this the place? The Dragon Slayer Guild, huh? Doesn’t seem like much.” 
The newcomer was none other than Patrick. 
Dressed in alloy armor, he exuded an imposing aura. 
A few personal guards accompanied him. 
He slowly dismounted and, with a kick, pushed open the front door and entered the hall. 
Lin Tian saw him from a distance and immediately recognized him from their previous encounter in Twilight City. 
[Patrick: Lv100<br/>
Race: Demi-human<br/>
Profession: Titan Warrior<br/>
Titles: Perfect Gene, God-Creation Project…<br/>
Health: 3000<br/>
Strength: 1004<br/>
Defense: 1001<br/>
Skills: Bloodline Awakening<br/>
Equipment: Alloy Heavy Armor, Alloy Longsword<br/>
Overall Power: 10100] 
Although he was one of the strongest warriors in the War Empire, his strength was slightly weaker than the other two Titan Warriors. 
The One-Eyed Owl gazed at him coldly, muttering to herself, “That fool with a death wish finally showed up…” 
Inside the hall. 
Osius and the others hurried out to greet him. “Long time no see, Duke.” 
Grugia stood nearby with a sullen expression but made every effort to play along. 
“Oh? I didn’t expect you to be so polite now,” Patrick sneered. 
Grugia forced a smile. “I invited you here with no ill intent, as I mentioned in the letter. We want to establish a branch in Twilight City and need your help to speak with the king.” 
“Hmm?” Patrick raised an eyebrow, not immediately responding. 
Osius suddenly understood. “Please, come inside. We’ve prepared food and drink—help yourself!” 
Hearing this, Patrick finally looked somewhat satisfied. 
Suddenly, he glanced over at the One-Eyed Owl standing with Lin Tian in the distance. “Guild Master, won’t you join me for a drink? I’ve heard your drinking skills are quite impressive.” 
“Heh, since the Duke is being so generous, I won’t refuse,” the One-Eyed Owl replied with a sarcastic tone, already plotting how she would crush him. 
But things had to unfold according to plan. 
Patrick wasn’t the least bit afraid, as he currently held the upper hand. The Dragon Slayer Guild needed his help. 
Once they reached the table, Patrick took one look at the meager spread of dishes, and his face instantly darkened. “You’re asking me for a favor, and this is the food you serve?” 
Grugia remained silent. 
Of course, they wouldn’t serve their best dishes. 
This was just a formality—let him eat and drink, then have an actor accuse him of harassment and assault. 
That would give them the pretext to kill him. 
Patrick eyed the wild and alluring One-Eyed Owl and decided to let it slide for now. 
He was long tired of fine cuisine. 
What he really wanted to taste was the One-Eyed Owl, like savoring an unbearably spicy Sichuan dish. 
Even though he knew it might hurt, he still craved it. 
As he drank, Patrick sneered, “Miss Elizabeth, how do you manage, living with so many men every day? Do you handle it well?” 
“Duke, with her strength, she can surely handle it, haha!” 
“But I bet she couldn’t handle the Duke!” 
His guards chimed in, laughing along. 
Lin Tian listened from the side, thinking they were courting death. 
The One-Eyed Owl was the kind of lunatic he wouldn’t dare provoke—even if he could win in a fight. 
The battle at the Iron Horn Tribe had shown him the terrifying extent of her madness. 
Suddenly, the One-Eyed Owl stood up, the wine glass in her hand shattering with a sharp crack as her face darkened. 
Osius quickly whispered, “Big Sis, please, patience, patience!” 
“I can’t hold back any longer! I’m going to rip his mouth off and shove it down his throat!” 
“Shhh!” 
In an instant, the One-Eyed Owl flung the glass shards at them. 
His guards were hit like they’d been shot by a scattergun, dying on the spot! 
The glass shards pierced right through their armor, embedding themselves in their chests. 
Patrick’s armor blocked the glass, but his face was already bleeding profusely! 
He jumped up, furious. “What the hell are you doing? How dare you attack me? How dare you kill warriors of the War Empire? One-Eyed Owl, do you want to ruin your chances of opening a branch in Twilight City?” 
“Attack you? The real show’s just getting started!” 
The One-Eyed Owl was past the point of tolerance, ready to strike. 
Osius was using every ounce of strength he had to hold her back. “Big Sis, please, we’re so close to the final step!” 
If a fight broke out here, not only would the guild be destroyed, but the entire city would be at risk. 
Patrick, seething with rage, ignored the warnings. “You’ll pay for this! This isn’t over!” 
With that, he stormed out. 
He immediately mounted his horse, ready to head back. 
But outside the city gates, members of the Dragon Slayer Guild were lying in wait, ready to ambush him and frame him for assault, leaving behind evidence. 
“Damn crazy woman! I’ll have the Empire’s iron hoof flatten this city! Then I’ll bind you up and do whatever I want with you!” Patrick snarled as he rode, seething with anger. 
He knew full well that if a fight broke out, it wouldn’t end well for him. 
Suddenly, he found himself blocked by a group of people. 
An actor they had hired rushed forward, creating a scuffle, and managed to snatch a trinket from him. 
That would be the evidence they needed. 
Patrick was livid. He wasn’t in the mood for this nonsense. “Get out of my way! How dare you block the path of a duke?” 
Just as he scattered the crowd— 
He suddenly felt a chilling presence behind him! 
In the split second he turned— 
A powerful punch whistled through the air, deafeningly loud! 
“Bang!” 
The One-Eyed Owl’s punch landed squarely on his jaw, smashing it completely! 
He was sent flying over a hundred meters, tumbling across the ground. 
He was nearly torn apart. 
“Ah… Ahhh… Ahhh!” 
Patrick screamed in agony, clutching his shattered jaw, on the brink of collapse. 
Without his jaw, Patrick couldn’t even speak. 
Suddenly, that figure stood before him again. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s cold eye seemed to gleam in the darkness. “I told you, I’d rip off your mouth and shove it down your throat!” 
She grabbed him and lifted him effortlessly. 
“Ahh… Ahhh!” Patrick’s mind was consumed by only one word: fear! 
This woman was a demon! 
She held him up, and he saw that in her hand was his missing jaw. 
With a sickening squelch, she shoved it into his throat! 
“Ahhh! You… you’re… dead!” Patrick groaned in agony, nearly passing out as his eyes rolled back. 
Inside him, the Titan gene chain began to glow with a brilliant golden light! 
From the sky, a golden bolt of lightning struck down! 
His body rapidly expanded, steaming with intense heat! 
He had fully transformed into a Titan! 
Now standing at fifty or sixty meters tall, his strength could only be described as terrifying. 
He immediately raised his foot to stomp on the One-Eyed Owl. 
But she dodged swiftly and began climbing up his body towards his head, screaming maniacally, “Come on!!!” 
“Bang!” 
With a powerful punch, the colossal body of the Titan fell backward! 
Grugia also transformed into a Titan and joined the fight. 
But it was mostly a one-sided beatdown from the One-Eyed Owl! 
She pummeled Patrick mercilessly, leaving him with no chance to fight back. 
Watching this scene, Lin Tian shrugged. “That’s enough, One-Eyed Owl. Until next time, I hope by then I’ll be able to outdrink you and outfight you, making you as tame as a kitten!” 
He planned to return and find a way to evolve. 
He also needed to deal with matters related to the empire. 
With each thunderous blow that echoed through the heavens, flesh was struck, bones shattered. 
Patrick’s entire body was beaten to the point of collapse, like a pile of mud. 
In plain terms, he was completely broken apart by the One-Eyed Owl. 
(So these perfected titans are Attack on Titan titans. Yk, with the golden lightning and all.) 
… 
Days Later. 
In Twilight City. 
Alexander, who was preparing to lead a campaign against the Demon King, was almost ready to depart. 
He had already secured agreements with several imperial kings, including Joan of Arc. 
But just then, a Perfect Titan Warrior entered the throne room, his expression grave. “Your Majesty, Patrick…” 
“What about him?” Alexander asked with a hint of curiosity. 
The Perfect Titan Warrior replied, “He was killed at the Dragon Slayer Guild. His body was just returned. According to the One-Eyed Owl, he was caught assaulting a civilian and tried to resist arrest, during which he was killed. There’s even evidence to support this.” 
As Patrick’s body was brought in, Alexander did not fly into a rage. 
His face, full of coarse flesh and beard, merely broke into a chilling smile. 
“Heh, heh, One-Eyed Owl, Dragon Slayer Guild… I never thought these lunatics would start playing mind games too?” 
He knew full well about the enmity between Patrick and Grugia. 
This had to be related. 
The claim of assault was just a pretext, a fabricated charge. 
Alexander muttered to himself, “It’s a pity. If you were just a bunch of simple lunatics, I could tolerate you living. 
But if you want to play games with me, then don’t blame me for playing along…” 
The Perfect Titan Warrior below asked, “Your Majesty, does this mean you plan to wipe them out?” 
“Me? Those lowly scum aren’t worth my personal attention,” Alexander sneered. Compared to the campaign against the Demon King, the Dragon Slayer Guild was nothing more than a minor annoyance. 
He pondered for a moment, “How is Landau? Has he been saved?” 
“He’s out of immediate danger, but he’s little more than a cripple now,” the Titan Warrior replied. 
Alexander nodded. “As long as he’s not dead. If you want to play games with me, then don’t blame me for playing games too. 
Send fifty thousand troops to Landau, along with two Armored Titans, two hundred Titan Killers, and all of you. Let him crush the Dragon Slayer Guild in the name of revenge!” 
His voice echoed like thunder through the hall. 
After speaking, he left without further thought. 
The Dragon Slayer Guild was nothing more than a minor problem, easily crushed by the forces he had assigned. 
In the Mage’s Healing Hall. 
On the bed, Landau, wrapped in bandages, couldn’t help but laugh when he heard the news. 
Even though laughing sent waves of pain through his entire body. 
“One-Eyed Owl, Grugia, Osius… you dared to oppose the War Empire? Not even a god can save you this time!” 
He was utterly confident that they would be annihilated. 
Including that madwoman, the One-Eyed Owl! 
The Armored Titans and Titan Killers were formidable forces. 
TL: While it’s technically Shield Armor Titan, I’m pretty sure the author is trying to reference Attack on Titan’s Armored Titan.
