Chapter 128: Joining Forces Again, Call the Dragon Slayer Guild to Slay the Dragon! 
TL: Sungmin 
However, 
There was no response after a long time. 
Normally, there would have been a burst of swearing by now. 
Lin Tian furrowed his brows and sternly said, “Gobu-kun, report the situation. What’s going on?” 
Because Rebecca’s charm ability was very powerful, they had built a wall here. 
To avoid being affected. 
The goblins on guard duty inside had all been castrated. 
There was no worry about such things happening. 
Yet, 
there was no sound from Gobu-kun inside either. 
Just as Lin Tian was about to push the door open to check, he stopped, suspecting it might be a trap set by Rebecca. 
Perhaps Gobu-kun had already been charmed. 
He might be waiting for Lin Tian to enter and then forcibly enchant him. 
Lin Tian then called down Gobu Tian, who was waiting outside. 
“Take a look inside and see what’s going on.” Lin Tian ordered. 
Gobu Tian had a bit of x-ray vision and should be able to see what was happening inside the wall. 
Not looking was fine. 
But as soon as he looked, Gobu Tian replied anxiously, “Boss! It’s bad, inside, Gobu-kun is dead! And that Rebecca is barely alive!” 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian broke the iron door along with the latch and rushed inside. 
The scene before him was just as Gobu Tian had said. 
Gobu-kun’s corpse lay on the ground, appearing as if something had gnawed on it, already too gruesome to look at. 
Rebecca, locked up with magic chains, lay unconscious on the ground. 
Her body also had several bite wounds, looking very miserable. 
The walls of the entire dungeon were splattered with blood, resembling a hellish painting, very eerie. 
Additionally, there was a hole about the size of a washbasin in the corner. 
It was so deep that the bottom couldn’t be seen. 
Gobu Tian suspected, “Boss, could something have dug a hole from the outside? I’ll go down and see what it is!” 
His body size was just right to crawl through. 
But Lin Tian stopped him, saying, “No, nothing came in from outside. Instead, something here, escaped…” 
As he spoke, he pointed to Rebecca’s abdomen. 
Bloodied. 
Something had clearly crawled out from there. It was obviously the child of Lin Tian and the Black Goat Mother Goddess. 
Even he felt it was bizarre and eerie. 
Like an alien, it had burst out from the mother’s body. 
“Help… help me…” 
Rebecca spoke at this moment, her body trembling constantly, terrified of something. 
Lin Tian hadn’t planned to let her live, but he had to ask about his child’s situation. 
He called for Ifreya to come and heal some of her injuries and magically bind her. 
“A monster… sob, sob, I gave birth to a terrible monster!!!” 
After ensuring Rebecca was not in danger of dying, she couldn’t help but cry out. 
Curled up on the ground, she was extremely frightened. 
A high-tier monster that drank blood and killed, now scared to this extent? 
Lin Tian’s expression grew heavier as he asked, “Tell me, where did my child go?” 
“That damn thing is a monster! It ate my internal organs alive, forcibly crawled out! It killed that goblin in front of me! It even tried to eat me but fled when it heard you coming!” 
Recalling the unbearable pain earlier, Rebecca continued to shiver. 
Lin Tian frowned, continuing to ask, “What did that thing look like? Any distinguishing features?” 
“A pitch-black goblin with ram horns! Its eyes were terrifying like a demon’s!” Rebecca remembered, becoming increasingly resistant and fearful. 
She said no more. 
Lin Tian felt something was wrong. That little thing seemed to have perfectly inherited the bloodthirsty and murderous nature of a goblin, as well as traits from its mother. 
The Black Goat Mother Goddess was likely no saint either. 
Goodness, it birthed an evil creature with insatiable hunger and potentially limitless strength. 
Lin Tian felt a bit helpless. 
He had thought he could control it, but he had underestimated the nature of aberrant creatures. 
However, since it had escaped, there was nothing he could do. 
If he encountered it in the future, he’d see if it recognized him as its father. 
“Ding, congratulations on obtaining the title ‘Wild Man of the Evil God,’ and receiving 100 life points.” 
Suddenly, the system’s voice chimed in. 
Lin Tian was dumbfounded, what kind of lousy title was this? It felt a bit embarrassing. 
But still, he felt a sense of pride and achievement. 
After all, it was an Evil God, a deity of supreme stature. 
Being called the ‘Wild Man of the Evil God’ wasn’t something just anyone could achieve. It was something to brag about. 
It was fitting for him as a goblin. 
“You guys, keep watching her, and also keep an eye on that hole. Report immediately if there’s any movement.” Lin Tian ordered. 
The castrated goblins who had been rotating shifts with Gobu-kun returned. 
Suspecting that creature might come back through the hole to find Rebecca, he didn’t rush to kill her. 
Using her as bait was an option. 
Then, 
Lin Tian prepared to leave with Gobu Kuang and others to deal with the Goblin King’s tribe. 
At the city gate, a hurried sound of horse hooves rang out from behind. 
Fiona hurriedly caught up, full of apologies. “Your Majesty, let’s go.” 
Although Alice knew the location, she had other matters to attend to, so having Fiona lead the way was the best option. 
Outside the city, many humans from the Goblin Empire were working on farms. 
Seeing Lin Tian, they all reached out to greet him. 
The scene resembled a grand king visiting his prosperous kingdom during a time of peace. 
Fiona was incredulous. “Your Majesty, you’re a goblin, aren’t those humans afraid of you?” 
“Humans would normally fear me, but the humans here are like goblins. Why should they fear me?” Lin Tian replied. 
Indeed, 
Once they left the Goblin Empire’s territory, humans along the road, seeing so many goblins, fled in terror. 
Fiona understood, “You truly are an unprecedentedly great goblin. What is it that you really want?” 
For a goblin, the greatest desire was usually just to eat their fill and have females to vent on. 
But it didn’t seem like this goblin in front of her would be satisfied with just that. 
Lin Tian smiled lightly, “The same as you.” 
“The same as me?” 
Fiona’s face was full of confusion. “But you’ve already established an empire, and it’s a powerful one at that, with food supplies surpassing any other empire! The people’s happiness is also the highest!” 
“Is that really what you want? Don’t you want centaurs to become a noble race, not despised by others?” Lin Tian coldly questioned. 
He was a transmigrator, but had been forced to become the lowliest goblin. 
From the start, humans wanted to kill him, torturing and toying with him at will. 
Since he couldn’t become human again, he wanted the word “goblin” to be synonymous with fear, respect, and awe for any creature. 
Not like the world, or Rebecca, filled with disdain and mockery. 
That’s why Lin Tian hadn’t planned to let that guy live earlier. 
It was an unyielding thorn in his heart. 
Since he couldn’t become human again, he’d stand on equal footing with humans, even surpassing them, surpassing gods, as a goblin! 
At this moment, Fiona seemed to grasp something. 
Looking at Lin Tian’s back, her pupils shrank! 
This small figure seemed inexplicably grand! 
“Hey, why don’t you have any sense? Our boss is walking so much, isn’t it exhausting? You’re a horse; can’t you carry him?” Gobu Kuang suggested, frowning. 
Since they were going into a cave, Lin Tian hadn’t ridden the flying dragon. It was still enemy territory, and leaving Little Huan outside was a threat. 
Upon hearing this, 
Fiona hesitated, “But I’ve never carried a person, or anything…” 
She was, after all, the leader of the centaurs. 
If someone rode her, it would be equivalent to being conquered, having to serve the rider forever. 
In the war between the Sword Kingdom and the Centaur Empire, many centaurs preferred death over serving humans. 
“Why are you so troublesome!” 
Gobu Kuang rushed to stop Fiona, a bit angry. 
Gobu Shan intervened, “Forget it, Old Kuang. You can’t beat her; don’t get your face kicked in.” 
“If the boss wants to ride, he will. If not, he must have his reasons.” Gobu Tian added. 
But Gobu Kuang persisted, “You guys are smarter than me and know how to act according to circumstances, I get that. I might be a bit foolish, but all I think about is our boss’s well-being, hmph!” 
“Alright, enough. Gobu Kuang, centaurs have a custom: if ridden, they must either willingly submit or commit suicide. Don’t force this little beauty horse.” Lin Tian explained. 
Only then did Gobu Kuang relent. 
But after walking a few steps, Fiona suddenly spoke, “Goblin Majesty, you… you can ride me.” 
“Hmm?” Lin Tian was a bit taken aback. 
He hadn’t intended to conquer her, nor had he planned any schemes. 
After all, centaurs were notoriously stubborn. 
They could do anything but be ridden. 
This sudden willingness to submit left him at a loss. Why would she choose to submit to him? 
He had even toyed with her feelings earlier. 
Fiona’s beautiful face blushed slightly. “I have an inseparable connection with you, and you’ve just earned my respect and acknowledgment. Come on, or I’ll change my mind…” 
Lin Tian wasn’t hesitant. 
He mounted her directly. 
It felt like an electric shock, but it was Fiona whose legs went weak, making it hard for her to walk, her face red with embarrassment, swaying slightly. 
This feeling of being ridden was unprecedented. 
Making her overly sensitive. 
“Are you okay? I might walk faster than this.” Lin Tian asked. 
Fiona bit her tender lip, insisting, “I can do it. I’ll adapt soon…” 
Only then did Lin Tian continue riding. 
It was incredibly soft, as if sitting on water. 
And Fiona’s fragrant silver hair filled the air with a pleasant scent. There was no more comfortable mount in the world. 
Moreover, centaurs running at full speed could even exceed the speed of sound! 
Reaching unimaginable, terrifying speeds. 
Sure enough, once adapted, Fiona could walk normally again. 
Thus, they headed towards the wild cave. 
,,, 
In the Sword Kingdom. 
Within the magnificent and resplendent Sword Sanctuary. 
Today, Edward once again gathered with the Gilbert brothers. 
“What are we waiting for? I’ll open a portal to the Dragon Slayer Guild right away.” 
“Alright, the gifts are prepared. We must invite Lord One-Eyed Owl! Let’s eliminate those flying lizards!” 
“Hmph, goblins, your death is imminent! We’ll have the Dragon Slayer Guild wipe you all out!” 
The three spoke in the hall. 
Their faces full of confidence. 
After a year of recuperation, the previous losses had been restored. 
So they decided to enlist the help of the Dragon Slayer Guild.
