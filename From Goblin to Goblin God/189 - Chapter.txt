Chapter 189: The Holy Tree Blossomed and Bore Fruit??? 
TL: Sungmin 
The conflict among them perfectly showcased the differences between people. 
Luna coldly said, “Don’t worry, nothing much will happen if you go back. At most, you’ll be punished, but I’ll take full responsibility.” 
Saying this, she prepared to lead the carriage carrying the Tree Spirit away. 
Immediately. 
Two Holy Tree Warriors stepped forward and grabbed the carriage. “President, even if you take responsibility, so what? We’re about to enter the city, start our business, and complete our mission. We’ll get our reward.” 
“But because of your willful decision, everything’s ruined, and you still dare to act noble?” 
Their words were filled with displeasure. 
Then, they sent a new representative. “Goblin Majesty, feel free to do as you wish, but we can’t guarantee your success.” 
Lin Tian’s lips curved slightly; this was a perfect start. He hadn’t even made a move, and they were already at odds with each other. 
He said, “It’s good you understand. I’ll take good care of your business.” 
After speaking, he stepped forward, ready to take the Tree Spirit away. 
Luna wanted to stop him but was blocked by the Holy Tree Warriors. “Madam President, remember your mission!” 
“You all—!” 
To avoid exposing herself and causing more serious consequences, 
Luna could only choose to remain silent in the end. 
When Lin Tian held the Tree Spirit’s soft, white hand, it felt incredibly tender, a strong sense of holiness washing over his entire body! 
However, even though he was a monster, he wasn’t harmed by this sacred aura. 
Instead, it was healing. 
As expected of the Holy Tree that protected all living things. 
Feeling the taste of a god for the first time, Lin Tian was filled with anticipation. Although it wasn’t a true god, only a plant god, it was definitely going to be a brand new experience. 
… 
Far away, in the Holy Tree Empire. 
The king stood beneath a vast, towering tree with lush green leaves. “As long as we have enough wealth, surpassing the Demigod Empire is within reach. Steady progress. With the Holy Tree’s growth, we will eventually dominate this continent!” 
Later, when the Holy Tree grew, it would surely attract the covetous eyes of other empires. 
So now, they needed vast wealth to expand the army, purchase supplies and weapons, and secure their position, lest someone snatch the Holy Tree away. 
The Holy Tree King deeply understood the saying, “An innocent man gets into trouble because of his riches.” 
That was why he took the risk of sending the Tree Spirit to the Goblin Empire. 
Other empires were not much different. 
At this moment. 
The Holy Tree King’s pupils suddenly shrank as he looked up at the foliage. “Wha-what’s going on? What is that!!” 
He saw small white buds beginning to grow among the branches and leaves! 
In thousands of years, this had never been seen before! 
“Impossible, the Holy Tree is about to bloom and bear fruit? But, it shouldn’t be! There has never been a record of the World Tree blooming in the tens of thousands of years it’s existed…” 
The Holy Tree King muttered in shock, confused and puzzled. 
Suddenly, he thought of something, feeling both expectation and surprise! 
When plants bloom, it’s akin to mating and reproduction in humans and animals. 
Excitedly, he said, “This is great! What kind of fruit will the Holy Tree bear? When the fruit falls, what will it become? It must be something good, hahaha!!!” 
… 
Goblin Royal City. 
The merchant caravans from the three great empires had all entered the city. 
In their hearts, they could hardly contain their murderous intent, eager to annihilate the entire upper echelon of the Goblin Empire. 
Especially Lin Tian. 
‘Ding! Health 1500! Attack 700! Defense 700!’ 
Seeing such a massive increase in his stats, Lin Tian was both thrilled and excited. 
The previous boost from Persephia was only about one-third of this. 
Clearly, gods provide a lot more. 
The conversion of strength should be around two thousand, maybe even three thousand. 
Reaching over ten thousand in combat power wouldn’t be an issue. 
“Tree Spirit, how are you feeling? Is there any discomfort in your body?” 
Up ahead, Luna anxiously whispered, carefully observing. 
The Tree Spirit shook her head. “I don’t know what just happened, but it felt very comfortable. My body couldn’t even control itself. Sister Luna, there’s so much strange food around, I want to try some.” 
Only then did Luna feel a little relieved. 
Compared to her, Persephia of the Giant Elephant Empire suffered much more. 
Although the Troy Princess fared better, she was still filled with anger, instructing, “Gather everyone later. We need to hold a meeting to decide our next move.” 
Ahead, Gobu Yue and Alice led the way, arranging places for them to stay. 
At the city gate. 
A large number of demi-humans and monsters hadn’t dispersed yet. 
However, after seeing so many human empire merchant caravans settle in, those who were about to leave all abandoned the idea. 
This place would now be safer than anywhere else. 
Moreover, it would be glorious in the future. 
But just as they were about to turn back and re-enter the city, they were blocked by Lin Tian. “Weren’t you about to leave? Why are you turning back now?” 
“Oh, Goblin Majesty, we—we just hadn’t thought it through earlier…” 
“Yes, yes, please give us another chance.” 
“Our family’s food is very popular, and we can contribute a lot of taxes to you!” 
Many of the demi-humans and monsters began to plead. 
In the back, those who had insisted on staying were grinning from ear to ear. 
A bunny girl teased, “Hmph, you opportunistic jerks! You still want to come back? Goblin Majesty will definitely not agree!” 
“Exactly! He took us in when we were homeless, gave us a chance to earn money, and allowed us to live a stable life. But you chose to flee during the crisis—serves you right, meow!” said Sophia, the owner of the Cat Café, angrily. 
She turned around and left, not feeling any sympathy. 
Lin Tian also issued his final ultimatum. “Now, you no longer have the right to enter the Goblin Empire. Leave immediately! Even the lands of the War Empire are under my control. If I find any of you there, just one word: kill!” 
“This! This is too much!” A dissatisfied demi-human muttered. 
Suddenly. 
An arrow flew out and pierced his head with precision. 
No one could even spot the archer. 
It was Lia. 
She had already been ordered to eliminate countless people who violated the rules and refused to leave. 
This was the best way to handle the situation. 
Lin Tian had no mercy for these people either. 
They were like time bombs to the Goblin Empire, ready to betray at any moment. 
Only those who invested everything they had into the Goblin Empire wouldn’t choose to flee during a crisis. 
There was no fear of them turning traitor. 
Of course, these people were not ordinary demi-humans and monsters; they were fixed merchants with assigned residences and shops. 
As for ordinary people, they could come and go as they pleased. 
“Majesty, please give us one more chance, we promise this won’t happen again.” 
A monster nearly knelt on the ground, filled with desperation. 
Lin Tian coldly glanced at them and then looked behind him. “Fiona, gather all the centaurs. I’ll count to three. If they don’t leave, kill them all.” 
“Yes, Majesty.” 
Fiona stomped the ground, creating a thunderous noise. 
A large number of centaurs quickly gathered. 
There were even many centaur goblins! They had goblin torsos and horse-like lower bodies. 
All of them held long spears, exuding an intimidating aura. 
Seeing this formation, many of the demi-humans and monsters, though reluctant, all knelt on the ground, hoping for another chance. 
“Majesty, if we leave, the many children in our tribe will starve to death!” 
“And your empire has expanded so much so quickly, we have nowhere else to go.” 
“Outside of the War Empire, it’s all human empires. We have nowhere to turn, please give us a chance.” 
“Don’t forget the taxes we’ve contributed to your capital!” 
Hearing these pleas, 
Lin Tian remained unmoved and directly gave the order, “Since you have nowhere to go, I’ll send you to a good place. Next time, don’t waste words with me!” 
Instantly! 
Hundreds of centaurs charged forward! 
Their long spears thrust upward, piercing through a monster’s heart on the spot! 
Blood flowed like a river in an instant. 
This time, they were so frightened that they scattered in all directions, not daring to linger for even a second. 
Fiona turned and said, “Majesty, they’ve fled.” 
“Are you asking me if we should pursue them? I won’t spare any enemy I can kill, even if it’s just a potential threat…” 
Lin Tian replied coldly, his eyes filled with murderous intent. 
Since they had already resorted to violence, resentment would surely take root in their hearts. 
If not eradicated completely, they might someday rise up and bite back. 
“Understood!” 
Fiona nodded. 
The centaurs charged again, their terrifying speed leaving no place to escape! 
Although about a third of the monster merchants were killed this time, this certainly wouldn’t be the last of it. 
Moreover, the three great empires had sent so much cargo. 
They then slowly departed. 
Heading toward the area where the three empires’ caravans were stationed. 
At that moment, Gobu Yue was arranging for them to settle in the spots left by the slain monsters. 
“How is it going?” Lin Tian asked slowly. 
Gobu Yue replied seriously, “It’s mostly settled. But are they really planning to develop here for the rest of their lives? They brought such a large shipment all at once!” 
Beside her, Sara quickly and respectfully added, “As long as the Goblin Empire exists, we will continue to develop here.” 
As she spoke, a trace of disgust flashed in her eyes. 
For the sake of the greater good, she had to endure it. This was her first mission, so some sacrifices had to be made. 
Otherwise, she would become a laughingstock in the empire. 
Besides, she was a princess. 
Lin Tian’s lips curled into a slight smile. Such hypocrisy—since you’ve said so. 
Don’t blame me for taking advantage then. 
He reached out and stroked her soft, smooth chin. “Is that so? Then you must work hard. I’ll work hard too. So, will you come to find me, or should I come to find you?” 
He even let his hand move downward. 
“Um, I’ll come find you myself… when the time comes, Majesty…” 
Sara was on the verge of losing her mind; she had never encountered someone so shameless! She suppressed her anger with great difficulty. 
She tried to dodge, but Lin Tian continued to advance. 
Even Gobu Yue felt that this was inappropriate, but could only manage a bitter smile. 
However, apart from Lin Tian and the Ant people, no one else knew the true purpose of these people, which was why things were unfolding like this. 
Lin Tian wasn’t in a hurry to reveal the truth, fearing they might notice something amiss. 
He intended to play with them slowly, bit by bit, until they went completely mad.
