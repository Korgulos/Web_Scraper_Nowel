Chapter 170: The Army Arrives, Battle Begins! 
TL: Sungmin 
So, Scar, Thunder Calamity, Sin, and other powerful dragons among the ancient dragon clan all prepared to set out together. 
“We ancient dragons have had enough of hiding here all day, too scared to go out. Lin Tian, when do we depart?”  
Suddenly, a wave of heat surged towards everyone, along with an overwhelmingly majestic dragon’s aura. It was none other than the Flame Dragon Mother who appeared slowly. 
Lin Tian’s eyes lit up. He had originally planned to set out with Little Black and the others, but he hadn’t expected even the Dragon King to join them. However, he didn’t see her child, likely hidden away, not yet ready to be exposed to the others. 
Without asking further, Lin Tian declared, “Right now, let’s flatten the War Empire!” 
With the Flame Dragon Mother’s combat strength exceeding ten thousand, coupled with Little Black’s near ten thousand, and several dragons with nine thousand combat strength, any so-called Titan Warriors were nothing but a joke. 
“Roar!” 
From the crack in the World Tree, a deafening dragon’s roar resounded through the sky, causing hearts all over the world to tremble involuntarily! 
It had been centuries since such a large number of ancient dragons had appeared. This time, there were dozens of them! Wherever they passed, they blocked out the sky, casting shadows large enough to cover an entire city. 
Below, humans, monsters, and every living creature were all terrified and fled in panic. 
“Dragons! The dragons are coming!” 
“Damn it, the dragons in the World Tree have all come out! Run!” 
“Didn’t you hear Gabriel sound the horn of the apocalypse? Why has the end of the world come?” 
The entire ancient dragon clan’s mobilization was no different from the arrival of doomsday. While the dragon’s humanoid combat power might not be the highest, their ability to cause mass destruction was unparalleled. A city could be reduced to ashes in an instant. 
The dragons soared onward, heading straight for the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Lin Tian rode on Little Black’s back, while Xiao Huan was left in the dragon’s nest to keep company with the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother. The two were old acquaintances, after all. 
“At this speed, I can hardly keep my eyes open.” 
Above the clouds, Lin Tian’s ears were filled with the roaring wind, making his eyes sting. From a distance, the dragons seemed to fly slowly due to their massive size, but in reality, they were nearly as fast as the speed of sound. 
They quickly reached the borders of the War Empire. 
Meanwhile, the dwarves had also geared up and were advancing in a mighty formation, much more orderly than expected. All of them were equipped with eleventh-tier magic gear, armor, and weapons. 
There was also a steel behemoth over five hundred meters long, resembling a bulldozer, with gnashing teeth and claws. Its massive mouth opened and closed repeatedly, crushing trees and boulders into fragments as it passed. 
Bill, who was driving it, held a bottle of wine in his hand, laughing, “Haha! This machine is even more exhilarating than my wife!” 
“Hmph, it was built with the entire nation’s resources, so of course, it’s different. But Master Bill, you’re too vulgar.” 
Beside him, Adele, with her fair face hidden behind goggles, piloted a flying steel chariot. Steam and flames erupted from the rear, though the power source was still magical energy. The steam was just for cooling, and the flames were added purely for style. 
Without the extra water cooling, the heat would have been unbearable. Still, it had a different kind of imposing aura compared to riding a dragon. Steel roared and flames shot out. 
In the distance, Katheryn’s expression changed as she channeled magic and controlled the teleportation of the goblin army. “What is that noise?” 
The Ironhorn Clan Chief flapped his wings and soared into the sky. “I… I can’t tell what it is either. Everyone, be on guard.” 
“That’s the dwarves’ armament. Gobu Kuang, prepare all defenses,” Alice leaped onto the treetops, her expression alert. 
The deafening machines, flying steel monstrosities, and the dwarves, bearded and mounted on pigs with hammers in hand, were crossing the mountains, heading towards them. However, Katheryn’s goblins were still tens of thousands away from completing their teleportation. 
Adele gazed into the distance. “So many goblins… this must be the stronghold Dennis mentioned. I didn’t expect him to have such a powerful force!” 
The sight was indeed overwhelming—an entire expanse of green mingled with the silver of armor. It was a truly breathtaking scene! 
Far more goblins than the tens of thousands of dwarves. 
Luen from the Dragon Slayer Guild was already dumbfounded, unable to believe that all these goblins and powerful beings were under Lin Tian’s command! 
“Who is this rookie? A Goblin King? But how could a mere Goblin King command so many powerful beings?” 
Luen, like a child, huddled in a corner, too scared to make a sound. Just Katheryn’s seemingly endless magic was enough to leave him stunned, not to mention the overwhelming presence of Alice, whose strength was beyond comprehension. 
So many goblins, centaurs, and monsters. 
One was stronger than the other. 
Alice leaped into the sky with force, swinging her long sword, “Super-tier Sword Technique: Sword Qi Tempest!” 
A massive wind wall, towering a hundred meters high like a tsunami, suddenly appeared! What was once at most ten meters high had now been amplified tenfold with the power of Sylph’s blessing. 
This forced Adele and the others to keep their distance in the air. The whistling sword qi made it clear that even a slight miscalculation would result in a crash. 
Seeing the sky full of steel monsters, Gobu Kuang was dumbfounded. “What the hell is this?! Steel… can fly?!” 
“Is the world outside really this amazing?” 
“Unbelievable! How are we supposed to take these down?” 
Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan were equally astonished, their understanding of the world thoroughly shaken. 
In the sky, Adele lifted her goggles and quickly said, “Don’t be nervous. Do you know Dennis? We’re here to assist in the assault on the War Empire!” 
“Dennis? Never heard of him. But if you come any closer, I guarantee I’ll shoot you down immediately!” Alice threatened. 
Bill jumped off his war machine, laughing, “Haha, beautiful lady, don’t misunderstand. You may not know Dennis, but he’s also a goblin. Our target is the War Empire, isn’t that right?” 
Hearing this, Alice relaxed her guard slightly, and everyone began to speculate. 
Just then, a dragon’s roar exploded in the distant sky, scattering the clouds instantly! The sun was completely obscured by the dragon’s massive body, plunging everything into darkness. 
Upon seeing this, the dwarves were thrown into chaos! 
Even Luen and the Ironhorn Clan panicked. 
“Oh my god, so many ancient dragons, and at least two or three of them are over a kilometer long! Run!” 
The dwarves turned and fled, abandoning everything else—survival was all that mattered now! 
The Ironhorn Clan quickly scattered as well. 
Luen swallowed nervously, but instead of fear, his eyes gleamed with excitement as if he were witnessing the most beautiful sight in the world. 
Clicking his tongue, he said, “If I can see so many ancient dragons before I die, I won’t have any regrets! Ah… if only Big Sis and the others could see this too! It’s so beautiful!” 
A group of dragons flapped their wings, creating a scene that could no longer be described as merely awe-inspiring. 
Only those who appreciated the beauty of dragons would be so captivated that they couldn’t move. 
Closer and closer. 
Luen had already closed his eyes, awaiting the fiery embrace. 
But then Lin Tian’s voice rang out, “Hey! Master Bill, Your Majesty, where are you all going?” 
“Huh? Prince Dennis!!!” 
Bill, who had been running for his life with his short legs, stopped in his tracks and looked up. 
He saw the many dragons landing behind them, taking a moment to rest. 
Lin Tian slowly dismounted from Little Black’s back. “It’s me, no need to be surprised. These dragons are here to help me attack the War Empire.” 
“This… how is this possible? Ancient dragons actually—!” 
The entire dwarf clan was in disbelief. 
Then, almost immediately, they erupted in admiration for Lin Tian. This time, it wasn’t just the female dwarves—even the male dwarves were genuinely impressed! 
The Ironhorn Clan Chief also let out a sigh of relief, his eyes filled with disbelief. “He actually commands dragons!” 
Even Alice, Gobu Kuang, and the others were so shocked that their jaws dropped. 
They knew Lin Tian had connections with a few ancient dragons, but this was the first time they had seen so many dragons! 
Two of them were incredibly massive, making it hard to breathe just by looking at them! 
Luen’s eyes hadn’t closed since. “My god, why is the Flame Dragon Mother here?! A kilometer-long dragon, such mesmerizing flames, and those beautiful scales! 
Wait a minute, that black dragon… no way, there’s really a kilometer-long black dragon too?! When did this happen? And, and, Scar is here, Thunder Calamity is here, Sin is here! These dragons are all famous!” 
Overcome with excitement, he rushed towards Lin Tian. “Rookie, what the hell is going on? You’ve been hiding too much! Everything feels like a dream—have I already been killed by Landau or something?!” 
It was all too surreal. 
Millions of goblins, dwarves who had disappeared for decades, the entire ancient dragon clan emerging in full force! 
And the Ironhorn Clan! 
The shock left Luen’s mind buzzing; he couldn’t process it! 
Grabbing his hair, he babbled incoherently, “Huh? Huh? What the hell? Damn it!” 
His words were a jumbled mess, too big to articulate. 
Lin Tian patted his shoulder, smiling faintly. “Still calling me rookie? You better calm down first, or I’m afraid you’ll pass out right here.” 
Speaking of fainting, several ordinary civilians had already collapsed from the shock. 
“Your Highness, how are things?” Lin Tian inquired further. 
Katheryn, holding the Endless Holy Grail and surrounded by magic, responded, “It will take a few more hours to teleport everyone over. Just wait a bit longer.” 
Hundreds of magic circles emitted pillars of light that shot into the sky! 
Because the distance was so great, the teleportation couldn’t be completed instantly and required some time. 
Inside Dragon Slayer City, the patrol soldiers noticed the dazzling light pillars from afar and quickly returned to report. 
Landau was being carried by two girls, seated in a chair resembling a wheelchair, his body covered in scars—miserable beyond words. 
His existing muscles were simply unable to sustain movement. 
At that time, he had lost too much flesh, and even the use of a super recovery potion couldn’t fully restore him. 
The potion’s effect was to accelerate the regeneration of flesh, but the recovery process required energy. 
Landau had stuffed himself to the brim beforehand, but even with the potion, it wasn’t enough for a complete recovery. 
As a result, he harbored a deep-seated hatred for the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
He asked, “Has someone set up many teleportation arrays in the distance?” 
“Yes, but we’re not certain. We could only see a few beams of light from far away,” the soldier replied respectfully. 
Landau’s scarred, pitted face darkened with malice. “Assemble the soldiers and set up ambushes everywhere. If they dare to come, we’ll make sure they don’t leave!” 
“Yes, sir!” 
Immediately afterward, Landau turned to the girl beside him. “Take me to the dungeon.” 
Slowly, they arrived at the dungeon where the One-Eyed Owl was being held. 
In the dim candlelight, a figure with meticulously defined muscles and bloodstained skin was kneeling on the ground. 
It was the One-Eyed Owl. 
Her shoulder blades, and even her clavicles, had been brutally pierced by spears, with the spearheads firmly embedded in the ground. 
With her clavicles pierced, she was unable to exert any strength, forced to maintain this position. 
She couldn’t move. 
… 
Merry Christmas everyone!!! 3 long chapters as a gift to you all &lt;3
