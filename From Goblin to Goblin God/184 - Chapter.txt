Chapter 184: Gobu Kuang’s Life in Peril, Joan Enters the City! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Devouring gods, huh? Though it’s a bit challenging, at least there’s finally a way to evolve.” 
Lin Tian pondered, feeling quite pleased. 
But suddenly, he cursed, “Damn it! Are you kidding me? What Goblin God? If I can already devour gods, what’s the point of becoming one?!” 
“Uh…” 
The One-Eyed Owl and the others were speechless. 
Veronica, on the other hand, mumbled in disbelief, “How could it be possible? How could a goblin become a god? What kind of power would a god in such a system have? Ridiculous! Laughable!” 
Her emotions were unusually agitated. 
The One-Eyed Owl explained, “Kid, you’re complaining about your fortune? Do you even know what it means to become a god?” 
Hearing this, Lin Tian was stunned for a moment. “If I can kill gods, wouldn’t that make me a god already?” 
“If you can ignite a divine spark, it would mean mastering divine power. Any opponent without a divine spark would be at your mercy. You could also create a mythological system, and as long as there are people in the world who believe in you, you could gain endless life and power. That’s all I know about it.” The One-Eyed Owl spoke heavily, her voice filled with longing. 
Unfortunately, she was just a demigod’s descendant, not even considered a true demigod, let alone someone who could truly ignite a divine spark. 
Apart from demigods having a chance to become gods, others were almost impossible to achieve it. 
And now, Lin Tian, a low-level goblin, had the potential to become a god. 
Thus, Veronica was filled with envy, jealousy, and hatred! 
Lin Tian quickly understood, “Since that’s the case, I’m a bit more interested now. However, becoming a demigod should count as an evolution, right? I wonder what I’ll turn into.” 
“You’ve already received the information, and my familiar died because of it. Shouldn’t you fulfill your promise now?” Veronica spoke cautiously. 
She was terrified. 
Terrified that Lin Tian might break his promise, because standing before her was a goblin. 
Her eyes were filled with pleading. 
Lin Tian’s mouth moved slightly as he said, “Alright, Gobu Jian, go to the other dungeon and bring Rebecca here.” 
“Yes, Boss.” 
Very quickly. 
Veronica saw that familiar figure again and was overjoyed. 
She was delighted because she could use Rebecca to escape when the time came. 
A succubus wasn’t just capable of seduction. 
She could also use blood to draw a magic circle to summon other demons from hell. 
Coincidentally, Veronica knew this magic circle. 
To avoid arousing Lin Tian’s suspicion, she continued, “Actually, you can break off her horns. She won’t be able to use her charm ability then. Don’t worry, I only love her and want to be with her.” 
“Oh? So ruthless? But it doesn’t matter, do whatever you want.” Lin Tian sneered. 
He exchanged a glance with Rebecca, and almost instantly, her eyes turned into heart shapes. 
Her body burned with desire, yearning to merge with Lin Tian. 
Veronica noticed this, finding it odd but dismissing it. Instead, she couldn’t understand why Lin Tian didn’t break off Rebecca’s horns. 
For someone as cautious as him, it didn’t make sense. 
“Darling, are you leaving? I still want to spend time with you. We’re not young anymore; isn’t it time to have a cute baby?” 
Rebecca bit her red lip, her voluptuous figure incredibly enticing. 
Just as Lin Tian was about to leave, he waved his hand dismissively, “No time for that now. Veronica, I’m off.” 
“Wait! Damn goblin! What have you done to my Rebecca?!” 
Veronica’s expression changed, her voice filled with terror! 
Yes, fear! 
As a woman who truly loved Rebecca, she was terrified. 
Lin Tian shrugged, “I didn’t do anything. Could I have charmed her into loving me? What do you think? Do I look like a succubus?” 
He then struck a few ridiculous poses. 
The One-Eyed Owl, filled with disdain, exclaimed, “My eyes! Are you trying to blind me completely? If there’s nothing else, let’s head to the city. There’s still a lot of fun to be had, haha!” 
Gobu Yue also left temporarily to handle the aftermath. 
Veronica spat in disgust, “Shameless and despicable! Give me back my Rebecca!” 
“Hmph, she was supposed to be dead already, but now she’s harmless and can even keep you in check. Are you sure you want her to stop loving me?” 
Lin Tian’s eyes turned cold, and the atmosphere in the room became overwhelmingly oppressive. 
Seeing his terrifying expression, Veronica paused, frustrated and helpless. “What exactly do you want?” 
She had hoped to rely on Rebecca to escape, but now even Rebecca was lost! 
No chance of escape was in sight. 
The once-mighty Undead, the master of the Great Tomb, had now become a complete prisoner. 
Lin Tian pondered, wondering what to do. 
Suddenly, an idea struck him, and his face lit up with joy. 
Veronica’s combat power was actually higher than her stats suggested because she could also unleash an apocalypse. 
If he could make her his familiar, then when things got tough, he could just flip the table and refuse to play anymore. 
“Come on, Lady Luck, bless me now, Lucky… Steal!” 
Lin Tian rubbed his hands together and then reached out toward Veronica. 
“Swish!” 
As light blossomed around him, a notification appeared the next second: “Congratulations, you have obtained Veronica’s love! Do you wish to steal it?” 
What?! 
Lin Tian could hardly believe it. Could Lucky Steal really be this lucky? 
Without hesitation, he confirmed. 
“You… what did you do to me? Why do I feel this strange discomfort?” 
Veronica’s eyes flickered with panic, confused and anxious. 
As Lin Tian looked at her, curiosity filled him. He slowly approached and forcefully straightened her skull. 
Their eyes met deeply, and he gently lifted her chin. 
In a domineering tone, he asked, “Do you love me?” 
“Love you, my ass! Get lost, you damn goblin!” 
Veronica immediately delivered a rocket headbutt, the hardness of her skull making Lin Tian wince in pain. 
He was almost stunned. 
“Wait, this doesn’t make sense! Didn’t I steal your love? Why don’t you love me?” 
Lin Tian rubbed his forehead in confusion. 
Veronica glared at him with utter disdain. “Hmph, you think you can steal my love? I’ve been single for a thousand years; I’m long past feeling anything for men. The only companion I’ve had is a woman, so now, I only love women!” 
Hearing her explanation, Lin Tian finally understood—she loved women, so stealing her love wouldn’t make her fall for a man. 
Cursing under his breath, he added, “Damn it, you better behave. Rebecca is mine now.” 
With that, he slammed the door and left. 
He needed to gather more information on demigods to prepare for his evolution. 
Leaving the dungeon, he sat alone on the steps of the plaza, deep in thought about what to do next. 
At present, there was a perfect target—a demigod, the so-called greatest king, the Sword Saintess, Joan of Arc. 
But with a combat power of 16,000, taking her on would be tricky. 
“Boss! Boss! Something’s wrong!” 
At that moment, the voices of Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan rang out. Both looked extremely anxious as they frantically ran towards the plaza. 
From a distance, Lin Tian could already see that they were injured. 
He stood up immediately. “What happened? Don’t panic.” 
Gobu Tian, panting and trembling slightly, said, “That Joan woman showed up earlier. Gobu Kuang was following your orders, executing those disobedient monsters, but Joan said they didn’t deserve death and started fighting with him.” 
“Gobu Kuang wasn’t strong enough; she broke all four of his limbs—no, six limbs! We tried to help but got beaten up too. Now, the One-Eyed Owl is tangled up with her!” Gobu Shan explained. 
Their injuries weren’t too severe, as they had fled as soon as they felt the overwhelming power. Luckily, Joan hadn’t intended to kill them, or they’d all be dead by now. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian’s anger surged, and he gritted his teeth, “Let’s go!” 
… 
Goblin King City, Eastern District. 
Monsters and demi-humans were fleeing in panic. 
“This place is no longer safe! Damn it, Joan of Arc is here, run!” 
“We’re doomed! The Goblin Empire is finished!” 
“What a terrifying opponent… Kuang was crippled with just one move. If only I were strong enough!” 
As the monsters and demi-humans fled, they chattered in fear. 
They all rushed to escape the city. 
But at this moment, Lin Tian appeared, “Everyone, calm down. I’m going to deal with Joan of Arc right now!” 
“It’s… it’s the Goblin King!” 
“Brothers, let’s wait and see! The Goblin King’s here!” 
“What good will that do? She’s a demigod!” 
Some held onto hope, but those who truly understood the power of a demigod continued their flight. 
Going against the crowd, Lin Tian soon noticed the commotion up ahead. 
“Boom!” 
A series of deafening explosions echoed. He knew that sound all too well—it was the One-Eyed Owl in a frenzy. 
In the street. 
Joan of Arc stood in light armor, radiating a holy aura that pressed down on the surrounding monsters, leaving them breathless. 
Their legs buckled, unable to move! 
The One-Eyed Owl attacked wildly, shouting, “You’re not welcome here! You hypocritical fake saintess!” 
Hearing this, Joan, who wielded the Holy Shield of Faith and had only been dodging without counterattacking, showed a slight change in expression. “Elizabeth Tilly, I don’t want to be your enemy, but if you keep pushing me, don’t blame me for what happens next!” 
“Hmph, then bring it on!” 
The One-Eyed Owl’s aura flared with fury, and her right fist tensed, muscles straining audibly as they coiled with power! 
She unleashed a heavy punch that seemed to ripple through space! 
“Bang!!” 
The fist slammed into the Holy Shield of Faith, sending shockwaves that shattered the surrounding shops like a pulse! 
Those monsters and demi-humans who had buckled under pressure were thrown aside. 
Yet, Joan of Arc remained completely unmoved. Though she appeared delicate, she possessed the stability and confidence of a mountain. 
Her golden hair danced in the wind from the punch, and her face was full of ease. 
She retracted her shield, then spun around and delivered a side kick. 
Joan’s kick sent the One-Eyed Owl flying, crashing into a building. “Your strength is indeed impressive, befitting a demigod’s descendant. But mindlessly wielding that power only makes your weaknesses more apparent to me.” 
Suddenly! 
A blur shot out from the rubble. 
The One-Eyed Owl had entered a berserk state. “Who gave you the right to act like you’ve won, delivering some victory speech?!” 
With a powerful punch, she genuinely forced Joan back. 
Even Joan was astonished. “To think your speed could reach such a level. You’re the strongest demigod descendant I’ve ever encountered. But there’s a threshold you’ll never cross…” 
Hearing this. 
Even in her frenzied state, the One-Eyed Owl instantly snapped back to her senses. 
With several rapid backflips, she widened the distance, warily watching her opponent. 
Osius and Grugia were stunned, exclaiming, “Holy crap, Big Sis actually stopped fighting? What the hell is going on?!”
