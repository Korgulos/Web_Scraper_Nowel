Chapter 45: The Dragon’s Nest! 
TL: Sungmin 
Upon hearing the painful roar of the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, the little creature hurriedly began flapping its wings, as thin as a cicada’s. 
It tried hard to fly towards the sound. 
Initially, it attempted a few times, only to fall after reaching about ten meters in height. 
But within just a few minutes, it managed to fly! 
Such a growth rate was incomparable to that of normal dragons. 
Dragons were naturally strong yet relatively rare due to their difficult reproduction and particularly slow growth cycles. 
Especially the ancient dragons. 
While it often took months for a young dragon to fly, this one could soar within minutes! 
This was the effect of goblin genes. 
At this moment, on the beach on the west side of Dragon Island. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother had already been blinded in one eye and had fallen onto the sand, causing the entire Dragon Island to tremble! 
Alicenia, cold and ruthless, said, “Just a bit off.” 
She had aimed for the forehead earlier but had missed and hit the eye instead. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother was now exhausted, unable to continue in her original form. 
She had to use the skill of demi-human transformation. 
She turned into a woman clad in purple biological armor, but her right eye was a bloody hole, very ghastly. 
“Crazy woman! Today, I will fight you to the death!” 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother pulled out a dragon bone sword and charged forward, slashing wildly. 
“Clang!” 
A harsh metallic sound rang out. 
The dragon bone sword was flicked away by Alicenia, landing in the sea. 
Alicenia coldly said, “Stop resisting, it’s meaningless. Is there only one ancient dragon on this vast Dragon Island?” 
Logically, there should have been a male dragon with the female dragon during her reproductive period. 
But most of the dragons on the island had been killed, leaving only low-level wyverns. 
“Hmph, what does it matter to you? What, are you scared?” 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, now half-kneeling on the ground, taunted. 
She was now covered in scars, her lava-like dragon blood splattered everywhere. 
This was valuable stuff. 
The Wandering Hero had been collecting it the whole time, each drop worth many gold coins, forgetting he came to slay the dragon. 
He was slacking the entire time. 
Alicenia didn’t say much more, her tall body as imposing as a towering mountain. 
She raised her long sword, ready to execute the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother. 
“Whoosh!” 
“Boom!” 
Suddenly, a black fireball shot towards her from afar, exploding in flames. 
Alicenia was slightly surprised but unharmed. She looked over and said, “Is this a hatchling?” 
“Don’t hurt my mom!” 
The little black dragon hurriedly flew in front of the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, shielding her. 
But the next second, it was slapped away by a fierce sword strike, staggering. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, both touched and worried, said, “Run quickly, flee to the place in your memory! Only there is safe!” 
Ancient dragons had memory inheritance across generations. 
That place was the Dragon’s Nest. 
“Swish!” 
As soon as the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother finished speaking. 
A cold gleam flashed. 
A dragon’s head flew high! Blood spurted ten meters far! 
Decisive and ruthless, that had always been Alicenia’s character. 
Especially when dealing with monsters threatening Bright Town. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s head was directly severed! 
The demi-human transformation began to undo. 
Her body reverted to its original form, the headless giant body struggling on the ground, toppling all the surrounding coconut trees. 
The dragon wings kept flapping, stirring up a fierce wind. 
“Mom! Mom!” 
The little black dragon cried out in pain at this scene. 
Veins of anger bulged on its head! 
Its abdomen clearly burning with fierce flames! 
It was gathering its most powerful attack! 
Annihilation Dragon Flame! 
“Boom!” 
It shot directly at the Sword Saintess! 
Unfortunately, she lightly blocked it, her cold and resolute gaze then turning to the little black dragon. 
She was very kind, but only to those she protected. 
If anyone dared to intrude, even close friends and family, she would show no mercy. 
The little black dragon was already furious. Having just met its mother, it now saw her beheaded! 
Roaring, it lunged at Alicenia. 
At this moment, the Wandering Hero thought it was his time to act, “Sword Saintess, stop! Leave this to me!” 
He gathered a few white magic balls and hurled them! 
Each one had the power of a cannonball. 
But the little black dragon dodged them all at high speed, then spat a glob of pitch-black, foul phlegm directly onto the warrior’s face. 
The powerful corrosive effect instantly disfigured his face! 
Just as its teeth were about to sink into his neck, Alicenia kicked the little black dragon, sending it flying dozens of meters away! 
It landed heavily in the grass. 
Too strong, this woman was not his match. 
It turned and flew towards the sky, escaping from there. 
Under the healing effect of the potion, the Wandering Hero barely recovered a bit, but still had shocking scars. “That black and green lizard! I want to stew him!” 
“He fled. Considering he hasn’t harmed the citizens of the Lionheart Empire, I didn’t kill him.” 
Alicenia wiped the golden dragon blood off her sword and sheathed it. 
She was calm and composed. 
In front of her was a hundred-meter-long dragon corpse. 
Cleaning it up was no pressure at all. 
After all, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s overall combat strength was less than three thousand, relying on her size advantage. 
Her strength in demi-human form was about two thousand. 
How could she be a match for Alicenia’s four thousand overall strength? 
The Wandering Hero, gnashing his teeth in anger, tried to cover his embarrassment, “Damn it, I messed up earlier. Really, I didn’t perform well. It felt like my body was lagging, and my vision was freezing.” 
It wasn’t just the pain; it was also the shame! 
He had come to slay the dragon, yet couldn’t even kill a dragon hatchling and was nearly killed himself. 
He could only say this to save face. 
“It’s time to go. It’s been less than half a day, we can still make it to provide support. I want to personally eradicate these goblin pests threatening Bright Town.” 
Alicenia didn’t care and was thinking about the goblins she needed to deal with. 
The Wandering Hero nodded, and the two returned to the small boat to set off. 
But an unexpected situation occurred. 
As soon as he used magic, his body felt completely drained. 
Even after drinking a magic potion, his mana was depleted almost immediately. 
The Wandering Hero looked shocked, “Sword Saintess, my magic seems to be useless. It’s that damned little lizard! That dragon flame of his can erode magic!” 
“So what are you waiting for? Start rowing.” 
Alicenia remained calm, tossing him a regular iron sword to use as an oar. 
The Wandering Hero, filled with guilt, could only row obediently. 
Rowing back would take one or two days. 
… 
Watching the small boat disappear over the horizon, the little black dragon peeked out from behind a rock. 
With eyes full of tears, it flew towards the corpse of the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother. 
It cried bitterly. 
“Mom, wake up, Mom.” 
It nudged the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s body with its little head, but to no avail. 
Suddenly, it seemed to remember something, “Right, the Dragon’s Nest, they must have a way to revive Mom!” 
It then picked up the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s head, ready to leave. 
But the dragon’s head weighed several thousand pounds, and its newly born, hungry, and weak body couldn’t carry it. 
The little black dragon looked at the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s body, “I’m sorry, Mom!” 
Tearfully, it ate the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s entire body, bite by bite. 
In the animal kingdom, many creatures ate their mothers. 
This wasn’t surprising, especially since the little black dragon now urgently needed an energy supply. 
After eating, its originally two to three-meter body grew to twenty or thirty meters! 
Its scales began to shine, and its wings became full! 
The original green spots turned into crack-like green patterns. 
They looked like shocking wounds. 
This time. 
It picked up the broken head of the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother easily and soared into the clouds! 
Its speed was astonishingly fast! 
Following its memory, it flew towards the end of the sea! 
It flew over islands and continents! 
Whether it was snow-capped mountains or deserts. 
Finally, a tree that seemed to support the heavens and the earth appeared in front of it. 
Looking from afar, the trunk stretched for thousands of kilometers! The entire horizon was this tree! 
The canopy looked like a falling star! 
It was so large that it covered the sky! 
This was the ‘World Tree’! 
The Dragon’s Nest was beneath the tree. 
As it approached the root of the tree, it indeed saw a huge abyss, like a bloody maw. 
The little black dragon quickly dived down. 
Breaking through the fog, it finally saw the true appearance of the Dragon’s Nest. 
Located in the magma layer hundreds to thousands of meters underground, the place was scorching with rolling lava. 
However, amidst the lava and flames, there were islands where one could stand. 
Many peculiar plants, trees, and small animals grew there. 
Looking up, it seemed like an endless sky. 
But it was actually the hollow trunk of the World Tree. 
The little black dragon slowly landed on an island full of dead trees, looking around curiously at this unfamiliar and terrifying environment. 
But it didn’t feel scared at all. 
As it was being curious, a pair of scorching, eerie eyes slowly opened above. 
“Boom!” 
Immediately, a gigantic creature fell! 
It stomped him underfoot like an ant. 
The little black dragon struggled continuously, but couldn’t break free due to the massive size of the creature, only exposing half of its body and head. 
It saw clearly what was stepping on it. 
A brown giant dragon, at least five hundred meters long, was curiously examining him with golden dragon flames. 
It laughed, “It seems a little ant crawled in from outside. Hmm, a dragon’s scent. Whose offspring are you?” The brown giant dragon asked. 
At this moment, ancient dragons began to appear in the air one after another, even densely packed! 
They flew and hovered. 
The immense pressure would have suffocated an ordinary human. 
Nearby, an even larger dragon, nearly seven hundred meters long, landed on an island. 
Its body was covered in deep scars. 
With fierce eyes, it said, “Greyl, why don’t you step on me? Instead, you’re stepping on a hatchling?” 
Greyl was the brown dragon. Annoyed, it said, “Scar, don’t think I’m afraid of you! Just because you’re bigger than me? Wait till I grow up…” 
It wanted to say more but was scared into silence by Scar’s cold gaze. 
It quickly released the little black dragon. 
Scar’s mountain-sized body made the little black dragon look like an ant. 
At this time, more dragons landed around them. 
They were of various colors and shapes, some nearly a thousand meters long! 
They surrounded the little black dragon. 
All of them were examining him, wondering whose child he was. 
Then, a deep, beastly voice echoed! 
“Growl…” 
The heavy voice resonated throughout the Dragon’s Nest! 
At that moment, all the dragons bowed down, not daring to lift their heads.
