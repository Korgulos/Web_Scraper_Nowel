Chapter 171: Defeated Before the Battle Even Begins?! 
TL: Sungmin 
Landau didn’t rush to kill her. He wanted to watch the One-Eyed Owl die slowly, in agony. 
Now that he was crippled, even if he wanted to do something to the One-Eyed Owl, he no longer had the capability. 
“Hmph, still not dead, huh?” The young girls brought Landau in front of the One-Eyed Owl and he mocked her. 
On the ground, blood had already mixed with the dirt, turning black and foul-smelling. 
Hearing the voice, the One-Eyed Owl’s fingers twitched slightly, but she didn’t even have the strength to lift her head. 
Her breathing was faint. 
Landau sneered, “Tell me the truth. Has your Dragon Slayer Guild formed an alliance with some outside force? Who’s coming to save you?” 
“If you don’t talk, I’ll kill that group of people anytime I want!” 
Hearing this. 
The One-Eyed Owl used all her strength to part her cracked lips and shook her head weakly, “N-no one.” 
“Heh, as expected. You bunch of notorious lunatics, who would come to save you? But I can’t rule out the possibility that some outside force might want to rescue you and then recruit you.” Landau speculated with a playful expression. 
That was probably the only possibility. 
But he had already set up ambushes—two Perfect Titan Warriors, two Armored Titans, and two hundred Titan Killers. 
Even if they faced an army of fifty thousand, they would still be able to fight. 
However, he couldn’t fathom which force could teleport fifty thousand troops here. 
First of all, such mages were rare. Secondly, maintaining the mana supply would be impossible, and even if they could teleport here, getting back would be an issue. 
Seeing the One-Eyed Owl on the brink of death, 
Landau grew increasingly furious. He used all his strength to raise his trembling hand and cruelly pinched her face, “Why aren’t you dead yet? I’m just waiting for you to die!” 
“I… won’t die. In seven days, you must release everyone in the Dragon Slayer Guild.” The One-Eyed Owl struggled to speak. 
Before surrendering, she had made a deal with Landau: if she survived for seven days, the remaining members of the Dragon Slayer Guild, including Grugia and Osius, would be released. 
A cold glint flashed in Landau’s eyes as he forcefully removed her eyepatch. 
He suddenly froze. Three ghastly claw marks were clearly visible on that eye, but the most striking part was that the eyeball seemed blind, yet somehow it wasn’t. 
It resembled a vivid, living crystal. 
He could even see his own reflection in her pupil. 
Unable to resist, he asked, “What’s wrong with your eye? Why does it look like a crystal?” 
The One-Eyed Owl didn’t answer. 
This made Landau impatient. He slapped her hard, “Hey! I’m talking to you!” 
“Has she fainted? Splash some water on her. Don’t let her pass out; she needs to die slowly!” 
The young girl quickly fetched water and splashed it on her. 
Glistening droplets rolled down the One-Eyed Owl’s delicately muscled skin. 
Seeing her wake up, Landau’s lip curled, “Hmph, so much for being the offspring of a demigod. You’re just a mouse, helpless against my whims.” 
He then walked away. 
He began to inspect the ambush. 
Tens of thousands of soldiers had gathered behind the city, waiting to close in once the enemy entered. 
The Perfect Titan Warriors and numerous Titan Killers were hiding together. 
The Armored Titans were curled up among the ruins like two massive boulders, impossible to distinguish unless they moved. 
Titan Killers were essentially Titans with only 50% pure Titan genes. 
They underwent specialized training to adapt skillfully to their Titanized bodies, mastering superior killing techniques. 
Their transformed height was around ten meters, but their speed and reflexes surpassed those of Perfect Titan Warriors. 
Hence, they were called Titan Killers. 
Ten or so of them could even defeat a Perfect Titan Warrior. 
Landau wore a smug expression, “Hmph, who dares come? I’ll make sure they die without a doubt…” 
Thirty miles away. 
The last batch of Goblin soldiers had been teleported over. 
Two million troops stood ready, solemn and imposing! 
All of them awaited a bloody massacre. 
Lin Tian counted the main forces. It turned out to be far more than he had imagined. 
Alicenia, Gobu Kuang, Gobu Tian, Gobu Shan, the Ironhorn Chief, the Dwarves, and a host of Dragons. 
Fiona, the Werewolf King, and various other monsters. 
Lia, Gobu Yue, and the others remained in the empire, while Gobu Jian guarded Veronica. 
It was more than enough; every single Dragon was an extraordinarily powerful combatant. 
Lin Tian held the Spear of Zeus, standing at the front of the army alongside Alicenia and the others, “Let’s go. We’ll start with the Dragon Slayer City, annihilate the Landau family, then march straight to flatten Twilight City! Kill Alexander!” 
“Kill!!!” 
The goblins’ war cries were deafening! 
Their momentum even surpassed that of the Dwarves and nearly matched the Dragons’. 
Ruen, following behind, was in disbelief. For the first time! For the first time, he felt the immense pressure brought by the goblins! 
It should be noted that even when the Dragon Slayer Guild learned of Goblin uprisings in the past, they never bothered to hunt them down. 
After all, goblins were synonymous with weak monsters. 
But now. 
He felt like the weakest one. 
The army advanced. 
The army advanced in a grand and imposing formation! 
As they marched, their sheer numbers blotted out the sun, casting a shadow over the land, making the sky and earth seem dim. 
Dragons circled overhead, greatly enhancing the army’s momentum. 
Bill, piloting a war machine, was ecstatic. “Hahaha! Come on, let’s send those scum straight to hell! I’m going to reclaim the glory of the Dwarves!” 
“Kill them all!” 
Gobu Kuang echoed, wielding four weapons, his strides arrogant and domineering. 
Little Black and the other dragons were also somewhat excited. 
It had been far too long since they had felt the freedom of the sky. 
Before long, they spotted the ruins of the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
From a distance, Landau noticed a massive, dark mass approaching. “They’re coming, and it looks like there’s quite a number of them.” 
Due to the curvature of the earth, he couldn’t see the entire army at once. 
He could only see a dense, endless crowd. 
But he didn’t care; what use was a large number of soldiers? The Perfect Titan Warriors, along with the Titan Killers, could stop thousands upon thousands of troops. 
However, the more he looked, the more something seemed off. 
One of the Titan Warriors, Tulan, voiced his concern, “Duke Landau, the number of enemy soldiers seems unusually large.” 
“What are you afraid of? Our soldiers are lying in ambush behind them. Once they enter the city, we’ll surround them, and then you transform and disrupt their formation. They’ll scatter like a herd of sheep.” 
Landau remained calm, confident in his battle strategy. 
But Tulan wasn’t as confident. “You’re right, but that’s only effective against an army of less than a hundred thousand. This—this is no less than a million, maybe even more! Wait, what is that?!” 
Suddenly. 
They saw the dragons in the sky. 
Even Landau couldn’t help but stand up, his eyes wide with shock. “Dragons—those are ancient dragons! Some of them are over a thousand meters long… Wait, why are there so many of them?!” 
The sky was filled with dragons, so dense they seemed to block out the light. 
He trembled from head to toe! 
It was a fear that came from deep within his soul! 
“No, no! Those aren’t humans; they’re goblins!” 
Landau finally saw it clearly—goblin after goblin, with ferocious faces. 
And at the forefront, the leaders exuded an overwhelming aura. 
Even the Perfect Titan Warriors felt fear. “Where did all these goblins come from? Am I dreaming? We have to flee, Duke Landau!” 
The entire horizon, both land and sky, was covered by the enemy forces. 
The visual impact was indescribably overwhelming! 
What was the use of an army of twenty thousand? 
Even twenty thousand Titan Killers were useless! 
Unless they had twenty thousand Perfect Titan Warriors, but even if the entire War Empire worked together for a thousand years, they couldn’t create that many. 
“My God, this is the first time in my life that I’ve been scared by goblins! Is this the Goblin Empire that has risen recently? Why are they here?!” Tulan said in panic. 
Suddenly, his heart trembled! 
Because Little Black had already flown over the Dragon Slayer City, its massive figure blocking out the sky as it passed overhead. 
The sheer size made every hair on their bodies stand on end! 
Their hearts were filled with only one word: despair! 
Landau collapsed into his chair. “Why, why!” 
They had just talked about encircling the enemy, but now it was they who were encircled! 
Lin Tian commanded his army to surround the Dragon Slayer City. Suddenly, they noticed the twenty thousand imperial soldiers behind them. 
“Attack!” 
At Alice’s command. 
Suddenly. 
A group of dragons swooped down, unleashing various elemental attacks! 
The twenty thousand soldiers screamed in agony as they were consumed by flames, lightning, and fierce winds. 
On the city walls, Landau watched helplessly as thousands of his soldiers were reduced to ashes! Their combat strength was crushed in an instant. 
They hadn’t even had time to react! 
Inside the city, the Titan Killers trembled in fear, and the Armored Titans kept their eyes tightly shut, not daring to move. 
They wished nothing more than to be mistaken for mere stones. 
They wouldn’t dare move, even if it meant death! 
“Duke Landau! Duke Landau! Are you okay?” Tulan shook him vigorously. 
Landau was nearly unconscious, barely managing to regain his senses. “W-what happened? Did I just see us get defeated without even fighting? Is that what happened?” 
Tulan wore an expression as if he had swallowed something vile, unsure how to respond. 
Because whether in theory or reality. 
It seemed they were already defeated. 
Just like a mantis trying to stop a chariot—there was no suspense. 
“No! No! How can this be!” Landau screamed hysterically. 
Behind the city, Lin Tian and his forces were scouting the situation. Hearing the scream, they scaled the walls and entered the city, spotting Landau and his men in the distance. 
But the Ironhorn Chief warned, “Be careful, there’s an ambush here.” 
Alice swung her sword wildly, and a sharp burst of sword energy forced out the Armored Titan. 
Standing about twenty meters tall, the Armored Titan had a blocky body, with shield stones protecting every joint. 
Though it was a formidable and invincible Armored Titan, 
it now stood there like a child, paralyzed with fear after being exposed. It didn’t know what to do. 
It was so terrified it even considered begging for mercy. 
Lin Tian frowned. “Monsters tamed by the War Empire? Kill them. Wipe them out.” 
Immediately! 
Alice, Gobu Kuang, Gobu Tian, Gobu Shan, the Ironhorn Chief, Fiona, the Werewolf King, and others rushed forward! 
The once invincible and heavily armored Armored Titan was instantly engulfed in a dazzling array of lights! 
It exploded into countless pieces! 
“Help, help!!!” 
The other Armored Titan gave up its act, stood up, and tried to flee! 
But this was nothing short of courting death. 
It barely took a few steps before being overwhelmed by concentrated fire, killed in an instant! 
Ruen’s expression changed drastically as he recalled how several Dragon Slayer Guild members had previously fought to their deaths, unable to even shake these monsters. 
And yet, these creatures were now being annihilated in seconds! 
But it wasn’t over. 
Bolts of golden lightning rained down! 
The Titan Killers hiding in the ruins couldn’t take it anymore, their courage nearly shattered. 
They all transformed. 
But not to fight, to flee! 
“Help! I want to go home!” 
“This is insane! So many monsters and dragons—what divine law did I break?!” 
“Brothers, our mission now is just to survive and escape from here!!!” 
Some who had just climbed the city walls were immediately snatched up by dragon claws, pierced through flesh and organs. 
They were lifted high into the sky and then dropped heavily. 
Smashed to death on the spot! 
Those who couldn’t escape were targeted by the Dwarves’ aerial war machines, unable to retaliate. 
Bill, piloting his war machine, blasted a massive hole in the city wall. 
He charged straight in. 
Against these steel machines, the flesh and blood of the Titan Warriors stood no chance. 
Under the concentrated fire of the entire group, 
there were only pitiful screams! 
Above, Landau and his men watched the scenes unfold, too shocked to speak. “What… what have we provoked?! Dwarves, goblins, the Ironhorn Tribe, Dragons! So many monsters—why have they all come here?” 
Their hearts were filled with just two words: 
Despair!
