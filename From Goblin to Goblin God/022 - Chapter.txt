Chapter 22: Building a Hero Tribe! 
TL: Sungmin 
… 
In the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
Lin Tian had almost fully recovered during this period of rest. 
It was time to once again improve his strength. 
After mating with Gobu Yue, his level cap had increased to over a hundred, but he still hadn’t gained enough experience. 
He needed to raise his level. 
Otherwise, facing the Sword Saintess would result in instant defeat. 
Lin Tian donned his equipment, took Ifreya by the hand, and prepared to level up in the enchanted forest. 
However, he suddenly thought of something. “Gobu Yue, you should come too.” 
It would be more dangerous in the future, and Gobu Yue definitely couldn’t die. 
She needed some strength to protect herself. 
It was best to take her along for leveling up. 
However, leveling up bit by bit would be too time-consuming. 
“System, start the Life Simulation.” 
[Life Simulation System is starting, current scenario: Cultivating Third-Generation Goblins 
After ambushing Bright Town and capturing the hero variant, you achieved decent results. 
But you have provoked the Sword Saintess, the human imperial, and even the massive force of the Holy Church. You need to quickly improve your strength and level. 
You took Ifreya and Gobu Yue into the enchanted forest to level up. 
In half a month, you killed two enchanted wolf packs, seven ghost-faced monkey packs, and several first-tier and second-tier magical beasts, reaching level 43. 
However, Gobu Yue unexpectedly reached level 50! Even surpassing you. 
Upon closer inspection, you discovered her talent passive skill ‘Wild Growth’ seemed to double the experience gained. 
You were very pleased. Even Ifreya, the dog, reached level 40. 
You lingered in the enchanted forest for another half month. 
Finally, you reached level 50, Gobu Yue reached level 60, and Ifreya reached level 45. 
Option 1: Return to the tribe and start planning the next steps. It’s too dangerous to stay outside any longer. Rating: 0 
Option 2: Your strength is still insufficient. Continue leveling up. Rating: 10 
Option 3: Level up to 100 to challenge the Sword Saintess one-on-one. Rating: 1000!] 
Seeing these outrageous options, Lin Tian was amused. 
Challenge the Sword Saintess one-on-one? Even if he reached level 100, it wouldn’t be possible. After all, goblins were low-level monsters with limited strength. 
Unless he evolved into a high-level variant, but even then, it wouldn’t guarantee a win against that crazy woman. 
It was better to use his brain. 
Time had passed, and it was almost time to check on the progress of the third-generation goblins. 
So, he chose option 1, returning to the tribe. 
Then he interrupted the life simulation, directly skipping a month ahead. 
[Summary: This enchanted forest can no longer provide enough experience. Leveling up is slow. 
Rating: 20 points (out of 100) 
Reward: Life Points x20 
This Life Simulation is complete, with a time progression of one month.] 
“Shush!” 
Immediately, Lin Tian felt a wave of dizziness in his head! 
His vision filled with blinding white light, as if he were standing in another world, the surroundings eerily quiet. 
From a bird’s-eye view, he watched everything happening in his original world. 
Frames of scenes flashed rapidly, finally freezing on the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
Lin Tian felt as if he were being sucked in, finally returning to reality. 
“My dear lord, are you feeling unwell?” 
Beside him, Ifreya’s voice sounded. 
Lin Tian opened his eyes and didn’t respond. Instead, he first checked his attribute panel. 
He was indeed level 50. 
Health 850, Strength 270, Defense 300 
Overall combat power was only 900. 
So weak. 
His level had been quickly raised, but his combat ability hadn’t caught up, resulting in an overall rating of only 900. 
But it didn’t matter; his attributes had increased, and the rest could be addressed later. 
He then glanced at Gobu Yue’s attribute panel. 
[Gobu Yue: Lv60<br/>
Race: Goblin<br/>
Profession: God’s Messenger<br/>
Titles: Female Goblin, Fallen God, Pure Soul, Monster Slayer, God’s Blessing<br/>
Health: 1000<br/>
Strength: 270<br/>
Defense: 390<br/>
Skills: Gene Devour, Wild Growth, Climb, Silent Steps, Stone Skin<br/>
Equipment: Basic Iron Armor, Basic Scimitar<br/>
Overall: 700] 
Her attributes had improved, but her overall rating was still shockingly low. 
This was probably because she didn’t know how to fight. 
As long as she had some self-defense ability, it was enough. 
As for Ifreya, Lin Tian didn’t care much; she was just a dog he kept. 
Then, he quickly went to see the newly born third-generation goblins. 
“Gobu Tian, where are the new goblins? Why haven’t I seen them?” Lin Tian angrily questioned. 
Gobu Tian lowered his head submissively. “Boss, they’re with the elves.” 
Lia had two goblin infants feeding from her, while another lay on the ground, curled up and seemingly very weak. 
“You’re back. I don’t know why, but only these three goblins survived. All the others were stillborn or died shortly after birth,” Lia said, her eyes full of sorrow, as if she were looking at her own children. 
Lin Tian, though still unsure, comforted her first. “I see, thank you for your hard work, Lia.” 
“Hahahaha! Disgusting goblins, you still think you can raise powerful offspring? What brainless fools!” Loder mocked at this moment. 
His hair had grown long and his beard scruffy, hanging his head while being tied to a stone, looking particularly miserable. 
But his mouth was still as sharp as ever. 
Lin Tian narrowed his eyes slightly and asked, “It seems you know why?” 
Loder snorted coldly. “The higher the tier of the goblin, the harder it is for its offspring to survive. If it were as easy as you think, goblins would have already taken over the world with their breeding capabilities!” 
“So that’s how it is. So you knew this from the start but kept quiet, causing my elf ladies to suffer needlessly.” 
Lin Tian’s expression grew increasingly cold and frightening. 
He turned to signal Gobu Kuang and the others. 
Loder suddenly raised his head, his face twisted with rage. “Come on, you beasts! I’m not afraid anymore! Bring it on!!!” 
“Oh? Then let’s change the game. You lot, come over here.” 
Lin Tian beckoned a few goblins and whispered softly in their ears. 
The goblins looked aggrieved and reluctant. “Boss, doing this is too…” 
“Don’t want to do it? Do you want to die instead?” Lin Tian threatened. 
They could all sense that Lin Tian had returned stronger and more formidable! 
Terrified, they complied immediately, approaching the bound Loder and leading him into a hut. 
Lin Tian smiled benevolently. “Goodbye. Enjoy your time.” 
“You!” 
“Get away! Disgusting beasts! Don’t touch me! Don’t kiss me!” 
“Oh, mother! I was wrong! I don’t want to be with a disgusting male goblin!” 
“Follow the boss’s orders and let me bear your children!” 
In the hut, instead of screams, there were the sounds of a man’s embarrassed and angry voice. 
At this moment, Lia’s sorrowful voice sounded. “Lin Tian, another goblin infant isn’t going to make it.” 
Lin Tian looked over and, indeed, the goblin infant on the ground had died. 
Fortunately, the two feeding seemed healthy. 
Producing only two every month, with just the potential to evolve into hero-tier, would still take a long time to evolve. 
Even spending a whole year would not produce many hero-tier goblins. 
It wouldn’t even be enough to eliminate the current batch. 
There was only one way—to capture more breeding tools. 
Thirty elves were too few. 
But at this critical moment, capturing villagers from surrounding villages would be like courting death. 
If discovered, they would certainly go to Bright Town for help, and then they would be besieged immediately. 
Currently, averaging three surviving per month would yield only about thirty in a year. 
Thirty hero-tier goblins were still not enough to fight against the Sword Saintess and her allies, with no chance of victory. 
There was only one solution. 
Thoroughly evolve this batch into hero-tier goblins. 
And the dragon they brought would be the best source of potential. 
“Line up! Today the boss lets you play with something special!” 
Lin Tian walked to the resting wyvern, stroking her smooth skin. “Good girl, all this food is for you. Enjoy.” 
Then, several goblins brought a large amount of wild boar, deer, and even magical beasts. 
Seeing this, the wyvern immediately began devouring them. 
Taking advantage of this moment, Lin Tian ordered the goblins to start working without delay. 
A day and night passed. 
The wyvern lay on the ground exhausted, panting heavily. 
Lin Tian was surprised that she did not resist. It seemed that not only the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother but other dragons were also in their breeding season. 
But first, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s needs had to be met. 
“You’ve been holding back for a long time, haven’t you? Good girl, you can eat all this meat.” 
Lin Tian ordered more meat to be brought. 
The other goblins were invigorated, extremely excited. 
It was as if they had gained dragon power within them, very thrilling. 
“Long live the boss! Mating with a dragon is legendary in the goblin world!” 
“Hahaha! I have a feeling I can evolve!” 
“Indeed, it feels like I can evolve into something big soon!” 
Lin Tian commanded them all to enter the enchanted forest and start an unrestricted slaughter, sparing no living creature they encountered. 
Only this way could they level up faster. 
The sooner they evolved into hero-tier goblins, the better. 
Today. 
Loder’s eyes no longer held defiance. Looking at Lin Tian, they were filled with fear and trembling! 
This goblin was too perverse! 
Powerful beyond human understanding! 
He was actually going to create a tribe of hero-tier goblins! 
A single hero-tier goblin could lead a medium-sized goblin tribe. What was the concept of having over a hundred? 
It was enough to contend with an entire city. 
… 
Banging a dragon is crazy.
