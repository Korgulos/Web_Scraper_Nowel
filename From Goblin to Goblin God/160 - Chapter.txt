Chapter 160: Revenge, the Perfect Titan Warrior! 
TL: Sungmin 
Note: Terminology change—Super Empire changed to Great Empire. 
“Hey boss, I bet you’re buying this for yourself, huh? Hahaha!” 
A group of Roses teased him. 
Red Rose’s chubby face couldn’t even hold in her tongue; she was drooling, laughing sheepishly as her intentions were exposed. 
Lin Tian waved his hand, signaling for the two men to come inside. 
“What’s up, brother? You brought us here to have some fun?” 
The man carrying Grugia spoke, his eyes full of excitement. 
Next to him, another man was carrying Osius. 
They both tossed them onto the sofa. 
Seeing this, Red Rose’s expression changed slightly. “L-little brother, you’re not thinking of selling these two to me, are you? Oh dear, I wouldn’t dare buy them!” 
These two were some of the strongest members of the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Not to mention, they were regulars here, well-known faces. 
Lin Tian quickly reassured her, “Don’t worry, boss. They’ll willingly become your property. Even if you don’t dare to do anything, if they want to buy their freedom back, you’ll make a tidy profit, won’t you? And then, just give me a share.” 
“Exactly, they lost a drinking contest, so they’ll accept any punishment.” 
“I’m sure you’ve heard about our guild’s drinking games, right?” 
Hearing this, Red Rose finally relaxed. “So that’s how it is! Alright, alright! Here’s the gold coins, and little brother, you can enjoy yourselves here today, on the house! Hahaha!” 
She couldn’t help but walk over to Grugia, giving him a firm pinch. 
“Just the size I like!” 
She tossed a large pouch of gold coins to Lin Tian. “There are about three thousand gold coins in here, no need to give change!” 
Immediately afterward, she hoisted Grugia and Osius onto her shoulders and carried them to the back room. 
Lin Tian glanced at the Roses and said, “Feel free to have fun; I’ve got some things to take care of, so I won’t be staying.” 
“Bro, we really owe you one, thanks so much!” 
“If those two try to take revenge on you, we’ll definitely back you up!” 
“Besides Big Sis, you’re the one I admire the most!” 
The group bid farewell to Lin Tian as he turned and walked away into a world of indulgence. 
These so-called ‘Roses’ now seemed to Lin Tian like nothing more than common wenches, their lips kissed by countless men. 
He found them utterly unappealing. 
To put it bluntly, he had grown too haughty, disdaining such lowly offerings. 
If it were someone like the One-Eyed Owl, though, he could still consider it. 
Back at the guild, only a few female members were left tending to the One-Eyed Owl and cleaning up the mess. 
Lin Tian counted the coins, feeling quite pleased. “Three thousand gold coins… In my previous world, that would make me a multimillionaire.” 
In the past, the total treasury of the Lionheart Empire only held around a hundred thousand gold coins. 
Equipping an army of a hundred thousand elite soldiers drained it completely. 
However, money wasn’t of much use to Lin Tian now. 
Revenge on those two guys was his real goal. 
“Ah? My head hurts… Where are Grugia and the others? How could they be so drunk? I even forgot to discuss something important.” 
The One-Eyed Owl slowly sat up on the nearby sofa, holding her head. 
She still seemed dazed and out of it. 
The important matter was the grudge between Grugia and Patrick. 
The Landau family was dealt with, so it was time to handle this too. 
Even if the other party was the Empire’s Perfect Titan Warrior, he couldn’t be spared. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian explained, “They’re probably having some fun right now.” 
The One-Eyed Owl suddenly perked up, pouring herself a glass of water. “Having fun? Without me? Why are we still standing around? Let’s go!” 
“That kind of fun isn’t what you’re imagining. Why don’t you just teach me the breathing technique first?” 
Lin Tian shifted the conversation to something serious. 
He figured it was about time to return to the Empire, so learning the breathing technique quickly would be best. 
That way, he could leave at any time. 
But the One-Eyed Owl wasn’t in any hurry. “The breathing technique can be taught anytime, but fun like this isn’t something you can have every day. That guy… taking advantage of me being drunk to have fun on his own!” 
Seeing her like this, Lin Tian decided to spill the beans. “I sold him to Red Rose. He’s probably having a blast with her right now. Don’t misunderstand, Big Sis.” 
Suddenly. 
Everyone in the guild hall was stunned. 
Several women couldn’t help but cover their mouths, giggling. “Red Rose? That three-hundred-pound shop owner?” 
“He’s in for a treat!” 
The One-Eyed Owl spat out her drink, laughing heartily as well. “Well done! That guy deserves it! Haha!” 
At this moment. 
A powerful murderous aura was approaching from outside the guild! 
The One-Eyed Owl smirked. “Kid, looks like you’re in trouble.” 
“Damn rookie! Get out here! I’m going to kill you!!!” 
“Boom! Boom! Boom!” 
The ground trembled. 
Grugia charged into the hall like a freight train, smashing through an entire wall of floor-to-ceiling windows! 
Right alongside him was Osius. 
Both of them were furious, their faces twisted with rage, as if they wanted to skin Lin Tian alive. 
Seeing this, Lin Tian put on a serious face. “What are you doing? These are the rules of the drinking game—are you saying you can’t handle it?” 
Grugia hesitated for a moment. “Who says I can’t handle it? It’s just that you went too far! Look at my face!” 
His face was covered in red marks, all from being whipped by a small leather whip. 
“I’m telling you, the sight of fat makes me want to vomit now!” 
Osius clenched his fists, his eyes almost bulging out in rage. He wrapped his arms tightly around himself and began to sob, “I… I was a virgin! And I lost it to that pale, fat devil! Waaa!” 
In his eyes, Red Rose was nothing short of a terrifying white-skinned demon. 
She had cruelly taken everything from him. 
Hearing this, Grugia’s anger faded, replaced by surprise. “What? Osius, you were a virgin? Rookie, did you hear that? How could you be so heartless?” 
“Can you even imagine the horror I woke up to? It was the most terrifying sight of my life! It was no less traumatic than seeing a naked old granny!” Osius was nearly in tears as he spoke. 
Both his spirit and body had been severely tainted. 
As a monk, he had always maintained his purity, similar to an ascetic, and had never engaged in such activities. 
Hearing the comparison to a naked old granny, even the Dragon Slayer Guild members who had been planning to defend Lin Tian couldn’t help but shudder. 
A sight worse than that? Indeed, it was truly cruel. 
Grugia pointed at Lin Tian. “I never imagined you could be so vicious! Too cruel! Don’t cry, love; I’m here for you.” 
Osius wiped his tears and threw himself into Grugia’s arms. 
In the end, the entire guild pooled their money together to buy them back. 
This made Lin Tian feel a bit embarrassed. “How about this: from now on, I’ll cover all your expenses at Midnight Rose. Does that sound fair?” 
“Are you serious!?” 
In an instant, Osius’s eyes sparkled like a child’s. 
He leaned in close to Lin Tian. 
The others, who had been worried just moments ago, sighed and muttered, “This guy’s really shameless!” 
“He deserved it. And to think we even pitched in to buy them back—I bet he was faking it!” 
“No, it wasn’t fake. I accidentally saw that scene before, that white, fat devil—ugh, I threw up on the spot!” 
At that moment, the One-Eyed Owl interrupted the farce. “Enough, enough! I don’t understand you losers. You can’t get a wife, so you just keep going to places like that…” 
Grugia timidly whispered, “You don’t have a husband either, and we, uh…” 
Instantly, a cold glare locked onto him. 
It felt like that glare pierced his throat, leaving him unable to breathe. 
The One-Eyed Owl coldly remarked, “How about I sell you to that white-skinned devil again?” 
Seeing everyone quiet down, she began to speak again. “I got so drunk earlier that I forgot to tell you about something important. You all know Patrick, right?” 
At the mention of that name, Grugia, who had just been laughing, suddenly went limp. 
His expression darkened. 
Osius also frowned slightly. “Big Sis, of course we know that guy, and he’s definitely someone who deserves to die!” 
“Exactly. I plan to take him down! Who’s with me?” 
The One-Eyed Owl scanned the group. 
It seemed she didn’t even need to ask; no one would choose to refuse. 
Everyone agreed without hesitation. 
But Grugia looked deflated. “Big Sis, this is a personal matter for me. It’s got nothing to do with you all.” 
“You little brat, you’ve been talking back a lot lately, haven’t you?”  
The One-Eyed Owl grabbed him by the collar and lifted him up as she spoke. 
Grugia was deeply moved, yet he still firmly held his ground. “Big Sis, I can’t agree to this. You’ll all die if you get involved!” 
The Landau family incident had been pure luck, thanks to Joan of Arc’s sudden appearance. 
Patrick, however, was not someone to be compared with the Landau family. 
He was a representative of the War Empire, and even if they killed him, King Alexander wouldn’t let them off the hook. 
It would be tantamount to declaring war on the War Empire. 
But the One-Eyed Owl didn’t care at all. “That old man Alexander failed to keep the Landau family in check; I haven’t even gone to settle that score yet. Killing Patrick isn’t going too far!” 
“Exactly! We all listen to Big Sis—it’s not going too far at all!” 
Everyone chimed in. 
But Grugia couldn’t bear to see them rush to their deaths. 
He was once a Marquis and was well aware of the War Empire’s strength. 
Even if the One-Eyed Owl wasn’t injured, she would still be crushed under the empire’s war machine, reduced to nothing but dirt beneath its wheels. 
Even the entire Dragon Slayer Guild would be nothing more than ants trying to stop a chariot. 
Grugia’s expression grew severe and angry as he pushed the One-Eyed Owl away, a dark and fierce aura emanating from him. 
The entire hall was filled with a heavy, oppressive atmosphere. 
The faces of those around him grew uneasy, unsure of what to say. 
Grugia glared at them. “I don’t want to say it again. This is not something you can get involved in…” 
“Boom!” 
Before he could finish his sentence, the One-Eyed Owl punched him into the floor, knocking the wind out of him. 
“I gave you face, and you still think you can boss me around?” The One-Eyed Owl cursed at him. 
Seeing this, Lin Tian couldn’t help but step forward. “Big Sis, how about this: let’s lure Patrick out and take him down one-on-one. Then we can pin some false charges on him. Even if the War Empire wants to blame us, they’ll have no reason to.” 
Osius jumped up excitedly. “You little devil! That’s just too devious!” 
Grugia instantly crawled out of the floor. “Rookie, I love you to death! If I set up a meeting with him, that guy definitely won’t refuse!” 
Patrick was the kind of arrogant person who wouldn’t pass up the chance to humiliate someone like Grugia if he offered himself up. 
Although Grugia and the others often acted impulsively, they did so out of loyalty to the One-Eyed Owl. 
Now, with this plan, if he could avoid dragging the entire guild into danger, he felt much more at ease. That’s why he found Lin Tian’s idea so brilliant. 
Even the One-Eyed Owl couldn’t help but give Lin Tian a look of approval. “I didn’t realize you were this clever. How about you become the manager of the Dragon Slayer Guild?” 
“Manager? No thanks. Big Sis, it’s better if you teach me the breathing technique first. I have some things to take care of, and it’s about time I left the guild.” 
Lin Tian spoke with a serious expression, looking directly at them. 
Immediately, the entire hall fell silent.
