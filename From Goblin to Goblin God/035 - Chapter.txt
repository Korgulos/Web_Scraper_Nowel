Chapter 35: The Mysterious Goblin Slayer 
TL: Sungmin 
The heavily armored mysterious man was none other than the infamous Goblin Slayer. 
He wasn’t an adventurer and didn’t belong to any faction. 
He simply enjoyed slaughtering goblins. 
If he had to be assigned a rank, it would be around the Epic level, as stories about him circulated widely throughout the Empire. 
Cecil felt awkward for a moment. “Truly rude of me, I apologize for not recognizing you.” 
“I never hoped for too many people to know me. Being able to quietly slaughter goblins is enough.” Goblin Slayer said indifferently. 
Old Gru took the opportunity to mock, “Haha, Lord Cecil, haven’t you even heard of Goblin Slayer? He’s someone who has killed goblin leaders, you know. 
By the way, they say in one battle you killed thousands of goblins. Is it true? Your combat prowess almost rivals the Sword Saintess!” 
Thousands?! 
Upon hearing this, Cecil’s face was full of astonishment. 
That’s way too many! And there were goblin leaders among them! 
Goblin Slayer started to get a bit impatient. “True or not, it doesn’t matter. Even if I killed tens of thousands, there are still endless goblins to kill.” 
Seeing his impatience, Gru quickly explained their intention. “We plan to join forces to wipe out that group of goblins. How about cooperating with us, Lord Goblin Slayer?” 
“Yes, yes, even the Sword Saintess fell to the goblins. It’s better to cooperate.” 
Hearing how powerful he was, Cecil eagerly wanted to recruit him. 
“Cooperate? I have done that with people before, but every time they got killed by goblins. I think I’ll pass.” Goblin Slayer politely declined. 
Cecil felt troubled. This guy was too arrogant, right? 
He even emphasized that the Sword Saintess fell. Was he really that confident? 
Gru wanted to say more, but Goblin Slayer interrupted again, “You need to join forces, but I don’t. Do you want to know why?” 
“You!” 
Gru suddenly crushed the cookie in his hand, his old face twitching. “Aren’t you being too arrogant! If you get caught by goblins and have your limbs chopped off and cooked, don’t cry for help!” 
He couldn’t hold back anymore. 
Previously, if anyone dared to speak like this, he would have blasted them with a powerful spell. 
Cecil, sensing the complexity of the situation, quickly tried to calm things down. “Forget it, forget it. It’s fine if we don’t cooperate.” 
“Hmph, I just hope you won’t come begging me for help then.” 
Goblin Slayer left without looking back. 
Leaving the two behind, one bewildered and the other angry. 
Cecil couldn’t help but smile bitterly. “What a strange person.” 
“Tch, just a pure waste. So he killed a few goblins, who gave him such a big face? Someone might think he cleared out some high-tier monsters, maybe even cleaned up the Great Tomb!” 
Gru muttered angrily. 
The Great Tomb was the largest monster gathering place in the Lionheart Empire, rumored to have a twelfth-tier demon king. 
It had always been a tough challenge, even the Sword Saintess avoided it. 
Then Gru stood up abruptly. “Let’s go! What are you still dawdling for? Quickly clean up those trash, I don’t want to stay in this damn place for another moment!” 
“Now? Are you sure we shouldn’t prepare more?” 
Cecil felt a bit wary, knowing even the Sword Saintess suffered a loss. 
Gru snorted coldly. “Prepare for what? Just goblins, can’t we handle them together? If we don’t act now, that guy will steal the credit!” 
“That’s true.” 
With that, the two of them and their team set out. 
… 
On a hillside far from the town, a large green head poked out. 
Those cold eyes became more and more unsettling the longer you looked at them. 
Lin Tian used the Elven ‘Keen’ skill to observe the three from a distance, calculating in his mind. 
“Goblin Slayer? I didn’t expect such a character to exist, someone who specifically hunts goblins. There are too many weirdos.” 
Previously, Loder and his group of perverts enjoyed torturing the weak. 
Now there was someone who specialized in hunting goblins. 
What did goblins ever do to them? Oh wait, probably everything. 
[Goblin Slayer: Lv65<br/>

“Hiss!” 
Looking at Goblin Slayer’s stats panel, Lin Tian didn’t know what to say. 
How did the stats range from one thousand to three thousand? 
Was this a joke? 
“System, are you kidding me? Or did something go wrong?” Lin Tian quickly asked. 
However, the system gave an annoyingly official response, “Sorry host, there is no issue here.” 
He couldn’t think of any more questions to ask. 
So be it, he decided to check the attribute panels of the other two. 
Cecil, with an overall combat power of only 1300, held the profession of ‘Holy Knight’ and possessed skills that restrained monsters. 
Gru, with a slightly higher combat power of 1400, was a ‘Great Mage’ with a multitude of skills, making him quite difficult to deal with. 
Watching them leave Bright Town, Lin Tian also mounted Little Huan and set off ahead. 
“These two Diamond-level guys seem pretty dumb. They shouldn’t be a big problem, but that Goblin Slayer… I need to think more about him.” 
… 
Riding on horseback, Cecil and his team soon arrived at the vicinity of the former Tian Kuang Tribe site. 
There was nothing left; it had been specially cleaned up to blend in with the surrounding environment. 
This created a misleading effect. 
It made those who came looking for trouble think that the tribe hadn’t moved but simply couldn’t be found. 
“Hiss? Such a big goblin tribe should have been discovered by now. This enchanted forest area isn’t that big.” 
Old Gru spoke in confusion, feeling that something was off. 
Cecil also said, “There are many traces of battles along the way. Although they are from a long time ago, they prove that the tribe was around here.” 
The two teams searched for a long time and finally found something. 
“Old man, look at this.” 
At this moment, Cecil picked up a strand of golden hair. 
Gru stared at it for a long time, sniffed it, and examined it closely. “If I’m not mistaken, this is elf hair.” 
“Elf? That neutral demi-human race? No way!” 
Cecil was somewhat astonished, suddenly understanding something. 
He quickly said, “Could it be that the elves helped the goblins hide? That can’t be!” 
Goblins were a race everyone wanted to eliminate on sight. 
If this were true, there must be a high-level intelligent species among them! 
“It doesn’t seem like hiding. I’ve scouted this area and found no caves. The elves probably helped them move and hide their tracks well.” 
Gru said solemnly, starting to think. 
Elves were well-known for their excellent concealment and stealth skills. 
Finally, Gru said, “Go find a flower butterfly. These butterflies love the scent of elves.” 
After busying themselves for a while, they finally brought back a brightly colored butterfly. 
Once at the spot, Cecil opened the bottle and released it. 
The butterfly seemed to have a purpose and began flying in a specific direction. 
“Follow it.” Gru instructed. 
The group walked, marking their path as they went. 
Eventually, they followed it to the riverbank. 
“Damn, they might have crossed the river. The butterfly has lost the scent.” 
Gru cursed inwardly, scanning the surroundings. 
Without the butterfly’s guidance, they were like headless flies. 
Cecil sighed, “It’s been almost a day, and we haven’t even found a trace. Let’s wait for Goblin Slayer to find them, and we’ll act first.” 
They couldn’t find them, but Goblin Slayer might have a way. 
Gru, however, didn’t want to work with that guy, even if it meant taking advantage. “Hmph, it’s unnecessary. Hmm? Look at the edge of the forest across the river!” 
They saw a big goblin wandering at the forest’s edge. 
Upon seeing Cecil and his group, it turned and ran into the forest. 
“Chase it!!!”
