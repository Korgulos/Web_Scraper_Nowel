Chapter 200: Heretical Summoning · Night Demon! 
TL: Sungmin 
“This is insane! Why did Sara betray us!? How did the Holy Tree Empire fall so quickly? Even the Tree Spirit is dead!” 
In the dimly lit dungeon corridor, Zolt and the others from the Giant Elephant Empire were frantically running and hiding. 
Each of their faces was filled with indescribable shock! 
They had planned to hide and launch a sneak attack, but now, revealing themselves meant certain death. 
Sara had even killed her own people, so they had no chance of survival. 
Their only hope was to escape this terrifying place! 
“Teacher, from the very beginning, we were already under their control!” 
“What should we do? If we stay here, we’ll be discovered sooner or later!” 
“How could we, the elite of the empire, be chased like this by a bunch of goblins!? Goblins! Aren’t goblins supposed to be synonymous with weak and worthless creatures?” 
The group of puppet masters was trembling all over, at a complete loss. 
Their expressions were worse than if they had eaten excrement, full of terror. 
They had thought this was just a beginner-level dungeon, but it turned out to be worse than a hell-level dungeon! 
Even Zolt felt aggrieved and helpless. “Even Sara betrayed us. We’ve been the prey from the start. Let’s hide and pray we can escape…” 
Suddenly. 
Zolt’s expression changed slightly. “Wait, there’s a powerful magical aura up ahead!” 
The group quickly moved forward. 
The closer they got, the clearer Veronica’s aura became. 
They saw two goblins standing guard outside a door because Gobu Jian, who had heard the commotion earlier, had gone out to help gather soldiers. 
Only the two were left. 
Zolt was overjoyed. “There’s a chance! Something powerful must be imprisoned in there. If we release it, we might have a chance to escape!” 
He then pulled out a Winnie the Pooh doll. 
Casting puppet magic. 
“Roar!” 
What had been a cute Winnie the Pooh instantly transformed into a menacing giant bear, its fur bristling as it roared ferociously! 
At over three meters tall, it almost touched the ceiling. 
It charged at the goblins guarding the door. 
With just a few swipes, it tore them apart on the spot! 
Even though it was a hastily made puppet, it had the strength of six to seven thousand. 
“See? Goblins are actually very weak. It’s just that Goblin King who’s terrifyingly strange!” Zolt said in a heavy tone. 
He hurried into the cell. 
There, he saw Veronica looking completely bewildered. “Who are you? Has the Goblin Empire fallen?” 
She was a bit excited but also very wary. 
After all, Lin Tian had previously provoked the Saintess Joan of Arc. 
If it was Joan’s army that had overthrown the Goblin Empire, she wouldn’t have a good ending either. 
But if it was another empire, she might have a chance to escape. 
“No, we’re from the Giant Elephant Empire. I recognize you. You’re Veronica, the Demon King of the Great Tomb, an undead!?” Zolt said in surprise. 
Veronica breathed a sigh of relief. “I see. Why are you here?” 
Immediately. 
Zolt picked up the Sealing Sword on the ground and questioned, “I can give you freedom, but you need to hold off the goblins’ attack for us. What do you say, deal?” 
Upon hearing this. 
Veronica’s expression became complicated. Clearly, these people were only driven to desperation by Lin Tian. 
She was very disappointed. 
But perhaps this was also an opportunity. 
She then agreed, “No problem. I hate those goblins to the core! Release me. I can’t wait to get my revenge!” 
“Good!” 
This was exactly what Zolt wanted to hear. 
He swung the sword to cut the chains. 
“My magic is depleted. You need to transfer some to me.” 
Veronica’s eyes were cold as she gave the order. 
At this point, Zolt and the others had no use for their magic, so they all transferred it to Veronica. 
Since she was a summoner with a high magic capacity, she directly drained their magic to the last drop. 
Feeling this newfound strength! 
For a moment, Veronica did think about resisting and taking revenge. 
However, Rebecca had already sided with Lin Tian. 
Moreover, Lin Tian had grown at a pace that she couldn’t even hope to match. Resisting would only prolong the inevitable for a short time. 
The best option was still to present a “proof of loyalty.” 
“Hurry, summon a heretical creature to cover our escape!” Zolt urged impatiently. 
They were betting everything on her. 
Veronica glanced at these people and raised her hand to stop them. “It’s coming…” 
Around the corner of the dungeon. 
Lin Tian and his group suddenly appeared, their killing intent surging like a flood! 
Zolt and his companions felt their hearts almost stop as they screamed hysterically, “Quick! Summon it now!!! There’s no time!” 
“Damn it!” 
Not far away, Lin Tian and his companions’ expressions changed slightly. 
Even Alice was particularly apprehensive, knowing that the strange nature of heretical creatures could be far more terrifying than imagined. 
These entities couldn’t be looked at directly, as their abilities were bizarre and unheard of. 
“Buzz!” 
At that moment, Veronica began chanting, and five black magic circles spread out from her as the center! 
A powerful surge of magic radiated in all directions! 
The earth trembled with the force! 
“Heretical Summoning · Night Demon · Zakxiri!” 
Outside the dungeon, the once-bright moon seemed to dim, as the sky gathered dark clouds, plunging the world into darkness! 
The light from the magic circle shot into the sky! 
The spectacle was both grand and shocking! 
The next second, “Boom!” 
The entire dungeon exploded into ruins! 
A black fissure formed, spewing out massive amounts of pitch-black energy! 
Each wisp of this black energy screamed like the vengeful wails of wronged spirits! 
The black mist quickly gathered in the sky, forming a large, ominous flying entity! 
It hovered above the dungeon’s ruins, emitting eerie, mournful sounds like the wind whistling through a desolate valley. 
Everyone who heard the sound felt their skin crawl and a chill run down their spines! 
The One-Eyed Owl couldn’t help but cover her ears, “Is this some kind of nightmare? My heart is racing, and I feel panicked and terrified!” 
The members of the Dragon Slayer Guild, usually fearless, were now trembling in fear! 
Even Zolt and his group were paralyzed with fear, not knowing what to do. “No wonder it’s a heretical creature; this aura even surpasses that of the Demon King of the Nile!” 
“What is that thing? Goblin King, I’m afraid I can’t handle this…” 
Sara, after glancing at the massive black entity in the sky, found it hard to breathe. 
She could sense that the King of the Nile was trembling in fear! 
Even a demon king-level creature felt dread towards the entity above. 
Lin Tian also sensed the danger. Clearly, this was a powerful heretical creature that Veronica had summoned with all her might. 
It wasn’t within her control, an over-leveled summoning. 
Even though it could potentially backfire and escape her control, she had still summoned it. 
She was playing for high stakes… 
Fear was spreading throughout the entire city because of that black creature! 
Most people were asleep, their faces twisted in pain, drenched in cold sweat, trapped in nightmares! 
Those who were still awake were running home like madmen, “What the hell, is this Goblin City haunted?!” 
“What day is it? Has the gate to hell opened? Run!” 
“I’m out, someone save me!” 
Although they didn’t know exactly what was happening, everyone felt like they had seen a ghost. 
Even in the distant Sword Kingdom and Magic Kingdom, the Sons of the Evil God sensed the presence of a kindred spirit. 
However, since he was sealed and kept captive, with goblins bringing him humans to devour daily, he had no intention of going anywhere else. 
In the ruins of the dungeon, Zolt and his group forced themselves to suppress their fear, filled with excitement and exhilaration, “Hahaha! Great! Such a powerful and strange creature! I see it! Goblins! Sara! I see you’re afraid now!” 
“The fruits of victory will ultimately belong to our Giant Elephant Empire!” 
“Veronica, kill them all as a token of gratitude for us, how about that?” 
Each one grew more arrogant by the moment. 
Indeed, anyone with eyes could feel that the strange creature in the sky was strong! Strange and strong! 
Definitely not something easy to deal with. 
Sara’s expression was complicated. Even the King of the Nile was terrified; it seemed they were really going to lose. 
She hadn’t expected these people to take advantage of the situation! 
Lin Tian narrowed his eyes, deep in thought, not showing much panic or fear, as if everything was still under his control. 
The One-Eyed Owl couldn’t help but say, “Kid, are you still trying to act all mysterious? I can’t fight that thing, nor do I dare to. Shouldn’t we retreat?” 
“Brother Tian, this monster is too scary. Just looking at it makes me feel awful and gives me a headache. I can’t fight it! And you didn’t even mention that Veronica the Undead was locked up in your dungeon!” 
Osius, Grugia, and the others all gave up on the idea of fighting! 
Even the Flame Dragon Mother was ready to call for Little Black and prepare to transform and retreat. 
However, Gobu Kuang and the others still stood behind Lin Tian. “Boss, what should we do? If we’re going to fight, I’m not afraid of that thing!” 
Sometimes, courage and loyalty surpass fear! 
Lin Tian smiled lightly, “Don’t worry, follow my lead.” 
“Goblin King, do you think I’m free now?” 
At this moment, Veronica’s haughty voice echoed, her crimson eyes shining brightly in the darkness! 
Her eyes were far more piercing and terrifying than the red eyes of the goblins. 
Lin Tian sneered, “What if I said you’re not?” 
“Why?!” 
Veronica immediately asked in an angry tone. 
Lin Tian maintained his disdainful expression, “You should know very well, otherwise, you wouldn’t be asking if you’re truly free, would you, Demon King…” 
Hearing this, Veronica fell silent. 
This was a psychological battle! 
The ‘Night Demon’ she had summoned was incredibly powerful, so much so that Lin Tian’s entire force couldn’t defeat it. 
However, she could only control it for ten minutes at most. 
Controlling the Night Demon consumed magic at an incredibly fast rate. If Veronica hadn’t absorbed all of Zolt and the others’ magic earlier, she would have already run out. 
She had specifically summoned the Night Demon to engage in a psychological battle with Lin Tian. 
She wanted to show him that she was powerful, capable of overturning the situation if she wished. If Lin Tian was willing to lower his pride, they could both take a step back and resolve their conflict peacefully. 
In that case, she would send the Night Demon away. 
However, she could only wait for Lin Tian to take the initiative to seek peace and propose terms. 
Veronica knew that if she asked for it herself, it wouldn’t work. 
Her true intentions would be exposed. 
But Lin Tian had already seen through her plan. 
Thanks to the system, he could tell that the Night Demon’s combat power was around eighteen thousand, nearly double Veronica’s. 
Otherwise, he might have been bluffed. 
“Hurry, Veronica, what are you waiting for? Kill them already!” Zolt urged impatiently.
