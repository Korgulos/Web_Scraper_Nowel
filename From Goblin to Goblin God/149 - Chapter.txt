Chapter 149: No More Words, Storm the Royal City, Seek Revenge! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Is that so? Then I can responsibly tell you, someone is framing you and us,” Lin Tian said. 
Right now, their enemy wasn’t this insect. 
It was those people behind it. 
Although he didn’t want to get involved in these matters, the One-Eyed Owl had gone this far and was still supposed to teach him the breathing technique. 
He had to keep her alive. 
The Ironhorn Chief was half-believing, lost in thought. 
Lin Tian said, “I’m also a monster; don’t you believe me?” 
He then scanned the surroundings with sharp eyes, quickly locking onto the treetops in the distance. 
Sure enough, someone was squatting there! 
“Over there! Quickly, have your tribe capture him!” 
Lin Tian pointed to the distance and tossed the female rhinoceros beetle aside. 
He gave chase. 
Seeing he was exposed, the man cursed under his breath and started to flee. 
Unfortunately, a few rhinoceros beetles flew towards him. 
With no way forward or backward, he unfolded mechanical wings and prepared to fly upward. 
Lin Tian quickly shot a string of poison elemental attacks, hitting his arm. 
The poison took effect rapidly in such a confined area. 
The man couldn’t flap his mechanical wings and fell from the sky. 
The Ironhorn Chief grabbed him like a chick, “Who are you? Were you the one who snuck in and killed our tribe’s children?” 
“Calm down, let me ask,” Lin Tian said, just about to speak. 
But he saw the man’s eyes turn hideous, bloodshot. 
He seemed to be in great pain. 
A strange worm crawled out of his mouth, turned, and burrowed into his nose, heading towards his brain. 
Lin Tian frowned, “Silencing?” 
Such a cliché situation was unacceptable. 
“What should we do?!” The Ironhorn Chief also sensed something was wrong. 
The man cried out in pain, “Save me! I don’t want to die! Don’t want to…” 
Lin Tian looked confident, “I have a way.” 
“Swish!” 
With a swift motion. 
His sharp nails, like razors, sliced off half of the man’s head. 
Blood splattered. 
The Ironhorn Chief was stunned, “What are you doing! Weren’t you going to save him?!” 
“Abnormal Fusion!” 
Lin Tian fused the man’s brain into his own body, beginning to read his memories. 
Generally, when he transformed into others, he didn’t want to read their memories. Absorbing too many memories at once could cause severe headaches. 
But he couldn’t worry about that now. 
“One of the three major noble families of the War Empire, the Landau family?” Lin Tian muttered darkly. 
From the memories, he learned that the man was instructed by the Landau family to do this. 
He then conveyed the obtained memories to the Ironhorn Chief. 
“In the end, it’s those damned humans! Let’s join forces and slaughter the humans, paving a new path for demons!” 
The Ironhorn Chief said, nostrils flaring with hot air! 
Honest and straightforward for so long, he had never thought of such a blood-boiling action. 
Lin Tian explained, “This isn’t the One-Eyed Owl’s fault; it’s the Landau family using her as a pawn.” 
Finally, the Ironhorn Chief calmed down. 
“What should I do? My tribe has suffered heavy casualties; I won’t rest until I kill this woman!” The Ironhorn Chief said with hatred. 
Indeed, hundreds of rhinoceros beetles had been smashed to pulp, many killed on the spot. 
Only about half of them were likely to survive. 
Lin Tian wouldn’t let her die just like that, “Are you stupid? Killing the One-Eyed Owl would mean helping the ones who killed your children. No matter how strong you are, do you dare to cause trouble in the War Empire’s royal palace?” 
“I…” 
The Ironhorn Chief was momentarily speechless. 
The pure-blooded Titan warriors of the War Empire were immensely powerful, capable of holding off tens of thousands. 
Moreover, the king was a war maniac. 
Even demons like him had heard of their strength. 
Going there would be suicidal. 
The Ironhorn Chief’s face was full of pain and unwillingness, “What should I do? We were just living peacefully, eating acorns, drinking tree sap, how did it come to this…” 
“Join forces with us. Then we can personally decapitate every member of the Landau family!” Lin Tian said. 
Hearing this, the Ironhorn Chief could only nod, “Alright, when do we act? I’ll seek revenge even if it means death! Let them know that the Ironhorn Tribe isn’t to be messed with!” 
“I’ll contact you when the time comes. For now, let’s go.” Lin Tian reverted to his youth, Andy’s form. 
He carried the severely injured and barely recognizable One-Eyed Owl, mounted his carnivorous horse, and slowly left. 
Along the way. 
Blood from the One-Eyed Owl kept dripping, covering Lin Tian’s entire body. 
“Damn it, this guy might really be dead.” 
If it weren’t for the faint breaths by his ear, he would have thought the One-Eyed Owl was already gone. 
He could only spur his horse to rush back to the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
“Osius! Grugia! Come and help!” 
At the entrance, Lin Tian didn’t care about anything else. He carried the One-Eyed Owl and charged inside. 
Hearing his voice, everyone rushed out. 
Seeing the One-Eyed Owl covered in blood and flesh, everyone’s hearts skipped a beat! 
Unbelievable! 
“Big Sis! Why is Big Sis like this!” 
“Hurry! Where are the healers! Save her quickly!” 
“What kind of monster left Big Sis on the brink of death!” 
Everyone was in a panic, scrambling. 
They laid the One-Eyed Owl on a table in the guildhall. 
Several who knew healing magic began treating her. 
Even Osius, who was skilled in healing, had a grim expression. “It’s no use; we don’t have anyone who knows world-class healing magic. Using super-tier magic can’t restore her skeletal structure.” 
“What about the super recovery potion? Is there none left?” Grugia asked the alchemist. 
The alchemist responded bitterly, “We used it up just yesterday. How could I possibly brew it so quickly?” 
“Then hurry up and brew it! As fast as you can!” 
Helpless, everyone could only keep the One-Eyed Owl’s breath going for now. 
They couldn’t heal her immediately. If her wounds were healed without addressing the skeletal damage, even the super recovery potion wouldn’t restore her bones. 
Seeing the One-Eyed Owl in such a miserable state, everyone felt deep sorrow and anger. 
“Damn it! The Ironhorn Tribe, right? Let’s go and wipe them out right now!” Osius was furious. 
Lin Tian stopped him, “It’s not as simple as you think, and it’s very complicated.” 
As he spoke, he glanced around for the wandering merchant. 
But there was no sign of him. 
Lin Tian frowned and asked, “Where is the wandering merchant from earlier? Where did he go? Bring him back immediately!” 
“What’s going on? Even if he provided the information, we can’t blame the informant.” Grugia asked, puzzled. 
He thought Lin Tian was blaming the merchant for causing the One-Eyed Owl’s condition. 
Lin Tian then revealed the memories he had obtained, “That guy was sent by the Landau family to kill Big Sis! 
The Landau family killed many Ironhorn Tribe offspring, making them hate humans. Then they had that wandering merchant provide the information. 
They wanted to use the Ironhorn Tribe to kill Big Sis!” 
Everyone was stunned upon hearing this. 
Osius pondered, “The Landau family? Isn’t that one of the three major noble families of the War Empire? They recently tried to buy the core dragon crystal but were refused!” 
“Didn’t expect those guys would play dirty since they didn’t dare confront us directly!” Grugia’s fists cracked with anger. 
He immediately waved, “Damn it, let’s go to the royal palace and kill those bastards!” 
Soon, 
The guild’s mages began preparing to activate the long-unused teleportation array. 
Previously, the War Empire had set up a teleportation point here to facilitate interaction and strengthen ties between the two forces. 
But all this time, no one from the Dragon Slayer Guild had ever visited the royal city. 
They were always drinking and having fun, only going on hunts when there was prey, settling disputes with drinking contests. 
At this moment. 
A man returned with the wandering merchant in tow. 
He threw the merchant to the ground, “Grugia, Osius, I brought him back!” 
“What are you doing? Don’t kill me, I didn’t lie, I saw the Ironhorn Tribe killing with my own eyes!” 
The wandering merchant curled up on the ground, feeling like his bones were about to break. 
The man who caught him back was full of rage, stomping and breaking his leg bone, “Hmph, still pretending? If you had nothing to hide, why did you secretly buy a carnivorous horse at a high price from a passerby and try to escape?” 
They had instructed the horse dealers not to sell to the wandering merchant, just to prevent his escape. 
So they allowed him to move freely within the city, knowing the guards at the gate would watch him. 
Seeing his plan exposed, the wandering merchant trembled in fear. 
He spilled everything, “Don’t kill me, the Landau family made me do it. I’m just a messenger, sob sob!” 
“Hmph, a messenger? I’ll make sure you never speak again!” 
Grugia, furious, pressed down on his mouth, pulling out a knife and growled, “Open your mouth!” 
“Mmm mmm mmm!” 
The wandering merchant clenched his teeth and shook his head rapidly. 
Osius delivered a heavy punch to his face. 
His mouth became a bloody mess, teeth shattered, unable to close his mouth. 
Grugia squeezed hard, and a bloody tongue stretched out. 
Swish! 
The knife gleamed coldly. 
A bloody chunk fell to the ground. 
The wandering merchant screamed in agony, his mouth like a fountain, blood gushing out. 
He was thrown onto the street. 
He writhed in pain on the ground. 
Soon, he bled out and went into shock. 
Biting his tongue to kill himself was unlikely, but with the blood clumping in his throat, he wouldn’t be able to breathe once in shock. 
Certain death. 
This was the fate of those who offended the Dragon Slayer Guild when they truly intended to kill. 
They killed humans far more efficiently than they killed monsters. 
“Kid, thank you for carrying Big Sis back in that situation!” 
In the hall, Grugia expressed his gratitude. 
Lin Tian felt a bit awkward and just nodded without saying much. 
At that moment. 
A magical beam shot into the sky! 
The mages had injected enough mana to activate the teleportation array. 
Osius waved and ordered, “Call back the guys on duty outside. We’re heading to the royal city to kill the nobles!” 
Everyone was busy, showing no sign that they were preparing for a bloodbath. 
Soon, forty members of the Dragon Slayer Guild gathered, excluding the ones who had died, like Stephen and the others. 
They had received word from Edward. 
They learned that the three brothers had died at the hands of the Goblin Empire. 
There had been no dragon. 
Out of respect for Edward’s status, they didn’t pursue the matter further, and it was considered closed. 
They had no plans for revenge. 
Firstly, dying to goblins was disgraceful enough. Secondly, the guild had no obligation to organize a revenge mission for voluntary hunting deaths. 
Most importantly, the three were gay and had poor relations with everyone. 
They had long wanted to kick them out. 
“Rookie, leave the hall and go take care of Big Sis in her room. We’ve received permission for the teleportation to the War Empire’s royal city.” Grugia stood in the purple light screen and spoke. 
Everyone was filled with fighting spirit. 
Knowing it was a mission of nine deaths and one life, not a single person hesitated or was absent! 
But as long as they could swiftly destroy the Landau family and exact their revenge, they would be satisfied.
