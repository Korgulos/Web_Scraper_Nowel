Chapter 40: “The Path” 
TL: Sungmin 
“I devoured the Goblin King and gained the power to control goblins! It was easy to slaughter that goblin dungeon, hehe.” 
Goblin Slayer spoke with madness in her eyes. 
It was unsettling. 
Lin Tian never imagined this person’s identity would be so complex! 
No wonder she was so powerful. But he asked, “Then what about that mysterious power of yours? How do you kill goblins so effortlessly?” 
“I can be considered one with royal blood. The goblin hierarchy is even stricter than humans. 
So, I mixed a bit of my body tissue into my weapons. When it enters other goblins, they experience an instinctive rejection! 
Simply put, it’s a suicide mechanism etched into their genes to prevent any harm to the king and allows control over them.” Goblin Slayer explained carefully. 
She possessed imperial blood, so she didn’t have this suicide gene. 
With everything explained so clearly, Lin Tian considered accepting her. 
After all, she was essentially half goblin. No, she was practically a goblin in human skin. 
Assimilating into the group wouldn’t be an issue. 
Lin Tian finally understood, “No wonder you choose to wear such thick armor. It’s to avoid being recognized by humans, right? But why do you call yourself Goblin Slayer?” 
Logically, she was a goblin. 
Yet, she was obsessed with killing goblins? 
“My mother was raped and killed by goblins. Of course, I want to slaughter goblins. As for choosing to mate with strong goblins and then eating them, that’s a personal interest.” Goblin Slayer continued. 
Forced by her ‘biological father’, she watched her mother being raped and killed. 
Indeed, it would twist one’s personality. 
She had a human body but a goblin’s heart. 
So, she chose to mate with goblins, equivalent to mating within her species, driven by instinct. 
This was why she had proactively thrown herself at Lin Tian. 
But she kept jumping back and forth between the two races. The goblin side didn’t accept her, and humans couldn’t possibly accept her either. 
Thus, a goblin in human skin was born, killing goblins. 
She did human things by killing goblins, while also thinking about mating with goblins. 
This behavior aimed to fill the void in her heart. 
Lin Tian looked at her, feeling a bit pitiful, “In that case, join me.” 
Seeing Lin Tian’s serious expression, Goblin Slayer was stunned for a long time! 
She seemed unable to believe he would say such a thing, and from the heart too. 
A goblin would accept Goblin Slayer? 
But she had killed the Goblin King and so many goblins! 
“Aren’t you afraid of me? Don’t you think I’m the enemy of goblins? I killed your king, after all.” Goblin Slayer asked tentatively. 
She initially intended to manipulate Lin Tian and toy with him. 
Now the situation had become very interesting. 
Lin Tian shrugged, looking indifferent, “What does killing the Goblin King have to do with me? You killed many goblins before; that has nothing to do with me either. We have similar identities. 
But I have chosen a clear path.” 
A clear path? 
Hearing this, Goblin Slayer stood there thinking, “How interesting, a gift from the heavens, to encounter such a beautiful creation as you… Kehehe.” 
“Don’t get cocky. Letting you join me doesn’t mean I’ll be dominated by you. I’m the one in control, understand?” 
Lin Tian’s expression changed, speaking sternly. 
“Really? Then shall we play some more? Just now, when I asked you to change positions, you obediently did so, like a child being punished…” 
Goblin Slayer said with an evil smile. 
Recalling this, Lin Tian felt ashamed and snorted coldly, “Let’s not bring that up!” 
Throughout, Goblin Slayer was the one moving! 
After some teasing, Goblin Slayer pondered for a moment, “Forget it. The situation in Bright Town is quite complex now. I’ll stay there for a while and serve as your spy.” 
“Eh? You have such good intentions?” Lin Tian said in slight surprise. 
Wasn’t she devoted to slaughtering goblins? Now she planned to help them. 
Goblin Slayer strolled across the river, “Because you are mine. It seems I’ve also found my own path…” 
She waded through the river, disappearing into the dense forest. 
“Hope you truly have.” 
Lin Tian watched her departing figure, then headed toward the cave. 
He took a deep breath, “Phew, I really can’t handle her. Fortunately, she increased my attribute points by over five hundred! Truly a woman with royal blood.” 
She was different from Gobu Yue, who was purely a female goblin. 
Whereas Gobu Yue was purely a female goblin. 
He then checked his current attribute strength.

Lin Tian was quite satisfied. 
Most satisfying was the extra achievement, Injected with Royal Blood. 
Gain 100 Life Points. (Old readers, please note: previous modifications indicate that obtaining new titles can also grant life points.) 
Lin Tian then entered the cave. 
“Boss, you’re here. We were just about to start a barbecue. Do you have any of that seasoning you used before?” Gobu Shan asked. 
Gobu Kuang laughed foolishly, “Hehe, that stuff makes everything taste better.” 
Barbecue? 
Upon hearing this, the captured people showed expressions of terror! 
“Don’t kill me, I can still be saved!” 
“If you’re going to kill me, just do it quickly! I don’t want to be roasted alive!” 
“Goblin Slayer, that traitor! Where is the Sword Saintess? Hasn’t she recovered yet? Can’t she save us?” 
“Father, I will sacrifice myself for the honor of our family, sob sob!” 
The ones speaking were those strung up, including Cecil. 
The cave echoed with their cries of despair. 
It truly was like hell. 
Next to them, Loder, who was tied up like a dead dog, slowly opened his eyes. His blurry vision gradually cleared. 
When he saw Cecil, he couldn’t help but mock, “Ahahaha! Cecil! Is it really you?” 
“Cousin? You’re still alive!” 
Cecil was stunned, eyes full of shock! 
How many months had it been since he was captured by goblins? 
And yet he was still alive! 
Unbelievable! 
Loder snorted, “Alive? You could die and I still wouldn’t die. I will never die!” 
Cecil didn’t care, “Heh, you look like you’re better off dead. How pitiful, the once-glorious Stantmont family has come to this?” 
In the noble circles, it was well known that Loder had become a disciple of the Sword Saintess. 
The Stantmont family had risen, constantly mocking other families about their uncertain futures. 
Cecil’s family had never been treated well by them. 
Now, Loder’s situation proved that he wasn’t doing much better! 
“You idiot, don’t you realize you’re also a fish on the chopping block? You’ll definitely die before me, hahaha!” 
Loder continued to mock. 
Indeed, he wouldn’t die because Lin Tian hadn’t tortured him enough yet. 
Hearing this, Cecil was puzzled, “Isn’t the Sword Saintess your master? She didn’t come to save you? Maybe you’re too weak for her to bother.” 
Mentioning that name, Loder’s face darkened immediately. 
He suddenly roared without warning, “Shut up! Don’t mention that bitch! That selfish bitch! She abandoned me for her so-called justice!!!” 
“Hahaha, so the Sword Saintess lives up to her title as the Guardian of the Holy Sword!” Cecil was laughing. 
Suddenly, his expression froze! 
Because a terrifying scene was unfolding nearby. 
Gobu Kuang picked up a bone skewer and began sprinkling barbecue seasoning on a cleaned and prepared live human. 
Manipulating a live person like a kebab. 
The seasoning was a mix of wild mint, cinnamon, bay leaves, rosemary, thyme, pepper, garlic, chili, and ginger. 
As the person was marinated, Gobu Kuang licked his lips. 
After seasoning the first skewer, he prepared to season the second, planning to cook them all at once. 
Gobu Shan suddenly grabbed the bone skewer, a sinister look on his face, “Hey, no rush. Roast them one by one. Let the others be filled with fear and despair. Their muscles will tense up, making the meat tighter and tastier.” 
“Heh, you really know how to enjoy it. Alright then.” 
Gobu Kuang sat by the campfire, waiting for the feast. 
Hearing this, the other captives were scared to the point of nearly soiling themselves, “That beast! So cruel!” 
Gobu Shan began the barbecue. 
As the flames touched the skewer, it first burned off all the hair. 
“Ahhh! Please turn me over, it’s burning! My balls are burning!” 
The man’s face twisted in pain, screaming until his throat was hoarse! 
However, Gobu Shan had no intention of turning him over. He used his regrown bone tail to brush oil on the skewer. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but feel disgusted, “You pervert, who knew you’d even be perverted about barbecuing.” 
“Heehee.” Gobu Shan smiled innocently. 
A smile that was chilling. 
For goblins, the screams were a delightful prelude to a meal. 
Cecil trembled in fear, on the verge of tears, watching the goblins feast. He was almost crying! 
Though a Diamond-level adventurer, the moments before death were scarier than death itself! 
Loder had become numb, showing no emotional reaction. 
At this moment, Gobu Shan’s sinister, blood-red eyes in the darkness locked onto the paralyzed Cecil. 
Fear crawled over his entire body! 
Cecil quickly pleaded, “Don’t kill me, I’m a noble! I can give you money, women, anything you want, just let me go!” 
However. 
Goblins didn’t care about such things. 
“Stop!” 
Suddenly, Loder’s voice rang out, decisive and strong. 
Cecil was full of surprise, slightly calming down, “Cousin, you…” 
Lin Tian became interested, “Oh? You useless dog haven’t spoken for so long, and now you finally have something to say?” 
“You’re Lin Tian, right? Let him go, and I will agree to any of your requests.”
