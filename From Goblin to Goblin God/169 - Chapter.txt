Chapter 169: Time to Show Some Strength, Declare War on the War Empire! 
TL: Etude 
“Your Majesty, what is the purpose of this?” 
In the royal city square, Katheryn was setting up a magical teleportation array, but she couldn’t help but ask in confusion. 
Alice and the others were equally puzzled. 
Suddenly, everyone had been summoned, and the situation seemed extremely serious. 
Lin Tian naturally needed to clarify, “A while ago, I met a few people, and now they’ve been captured by an army. We need to go rescue them.” 
“Is there going to be a slaughter? Heh heh heh! That’s my favorite!” Gobu Kuang couldn’t help but laugh. 
Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan were already cracking their knuckles in anticipation. 
No one objected. 
Moreover, Fiona, the Werewolf King, and other protected demi-humans also eagerly participated. 
Now was the time to show their worth, to kill as many enemies as possible, and to gain Lin Tian’s favor. 
The stronger they were, the better. Lin Tian would never mind having more powerful allies. 
At this moment, Katheryn said, “Your Majesty, this magical teleportation point is set up, but on the other side…” 
“It’s not enough. We need to set up a hundred teleportation points all at once.” Lin Tian ordered. 
One teleportation point could only transfer a maximum of a thousand people at a time. A hundred points meant a hundred thousand. 
But the energy consumption for each teleportation was unimaginably huge. 
If Katheryn didn’t have the Endless Holy Grail, she’d likely exhaust herself to death. “Your Majesty, is this really necessary?” 
“Of course it is. Later, I’ll take her to set up teleportation points at the destination. 
Once connected, Alice, gather an army of two million goblins and start transporting them over. We’re going to declare war directly on the War Empire.” Lin Tian stated. 
Although the War Empire was very powerful, and two million goblins might not be enough to defeat them, this time he planned to involve the ancient dragons and dwarves as well. 
He intended to take down this empire in one fell swoop, leaving no loose ends. Otherwise, if they wiped out the Landau army that attacked the Dragon Slayer Guild, the War Empire could retaliate. 
They would surely ally with other empires to attack him. 
The best strategy was to make them disappear completely overnight. 
Then, they could focus on dealing with the allied forces of those three empires. 
In reality, apart from their million elite soldiers, the War Empire only had a few with a combat strength above ten thousand. 
They weren’t really a threat. 
Fiona couldn’t help but marvel, “Your Majesty, who are these people that are worth deploying all your forces for?” 
“Hmph, consider it a declaration to all humans, showing the strength of our Goblin Empire! So they won’t send people like today to cause trouble again.” 
After speaking, Lin Tian took Katheryn in his arms and mounted Xiao Huan. 
Xiao Huan’s level had risen as well, and its flying speed was now much faster than before. 
In about five hours, they could reach the War Empire’s territory, which was roughly a thousand kilometers away—not too far. 
After all, they didn’t have to start from the Great Tomb and cross the entire Lionheart Empire like before. 
Soon. 
They arrived twenty kilometers outside the town of the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
The Endless Holy Grail in Katheryn’s hand glowed brightly. Lin Tian then notified the Ironhorn Tribe to help guard the area. 
“I’ve decided to declare all-out war on the War Empire. Before that, please help protect this lady.” Lin Tian requested. 
The Ironhorn Chief was fired up, “Alright! I didn’t expect you to be so brave. My Ironhorn Tribe will give our full support!” 
“Thank you.” 
After that, Lin Tian went to find the dwarves. 
… 
Throughout the kingdom. 
When the news spread that they could return to the surface, everyone was overjoyed. 
Master Bill was moved, “Prince Dennis—no, Goblin Majesty, are you really going to declare war on the War Empire? They have a million elite soldiers, two million regular soldiers, and many titan soldiers.” 
“What, you dwarves possess such powerful magic forging techniques, yet you lack confidence?” 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but tease. 
Queen Adele fully supported him, “If you have it, we dwarves have it. Besides, your offspring have already become the main force of the dwarven army. They don’t need my permission to join the battle.” 
“Boss, we’ve longed to return to the surface and engage in a bloody battle!” The dwarf soldier captain said with a wicked grin. 
He even exuded a bit of goblin-like aura. 
But Lin Tian liked it very much, “Alright, then you all gather twenty kilometers outside the Dragon Slayer Guild’s town when the time comes and say that I called for you.” 
“Did you hear that? Prepare to gather the soldiers. All dwarves are to participate in the battle!” Adele ordered, even picking up a magic weapon herself. 
… 
After giving instructions to the dwarves, Lin Tian headed directly to the World Tree. 
That place was farther away, but with the speed of the ancient dragons, they could make it in time. 
In fact, they could arrive before the dwarves and Katheryn were even ready. 
The dwarves would need at least two or three days to prepare. 
After all, they hadn’t fought a war in decades, and mobilizing the entire population for war would take some time. 
Katheryn also couldn’t teleport two million goblins all at once. 
Even though the Endless Holy Grail could absorb the magic power of the sun, moon, and stars for replenishment. 
But it would still take at least two or three days. 
One day passed. 
Finally, they once again saw the World Tree, towering and blocking out the sky. 
Lin Tian, riding on Xiao Huan, descended into the underground fissure. 
Soon, they were surrounded by a group of ancient dragons. 
Little Black received the news and hurried over, “Father! Father!” 
The enormous figure rushed through the narrow space, scaring the ancient dragons into scattering in all directions. 
Even Xiao Huan’s legs went weak. 
However, just as Little Black approached, she transformed into her humanoid form. 
She leapt into Lin Tian’s arms, overflowing with excitement and joy. 
“You’ve grown again, you little rascal. Luckily, you’re still a child in this form, or else I wouldn’t be able to hold you.” Lin Tian chuckled as he spoke. 
Nearby, Scar couldn’t help but ask, “Mr. Goblin, did you find the dragon crystal needed to revive Ferbis?” 
Ferbis was the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother. 
Upon hearing this, Little Black’s eyes filled with anticipation as well. 
Lin Tian nodded, “I found it. First, take me to the roots of the World Tree.” 
They arrived at the tangled roots. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother appeared immediately, “It’s been a long time, Lin Tian. I almost thought you’d forgotten about me.” 
“How could I forget my first partner? You not only did me a great favor, but we’ve also been through so much together. We’re practically an old married couple by now.” Lin Tian replied. 
Little Black blushed slightly, “Father, Mother, please don’t say such things in front of me. It’s embarrassing.” 
“Haha, alright then. I’ve come this time to show you something.” 
As he spoke, Lin Tian took out the core dragon crystal from his spatial ring. 
Seeing this, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s expression changed slightly, “This is… my father’s dragon crystal! How did you get it?! Wasn’t it taken by that crazy woman from the Dragon Slayer Guild?” 
“It’s a long story. How can we use this to revive you?” Lin Tian asked in confusion. 
Little Black quickly answered, “I know! It needs to be planted in these roots. Mother can slowly absorb the dragon crystal, and that will do it!” 
“So that’s how it works.” 
As Lin Tian planted the crystal, he recounted the events concerning the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother seemed somewhat melancholy, “I see. I remember when my father returned in disgrace, he was never the same. But I can’t really blame the One-Eyed Owl; it was my father who fought with the Dark Elemental Dragon, destroying many nations, and that’s why he was labeled as an evil dragon.” 
“Little Black, go help your father, and everyone else too. This way, we won’t be targeted by the Dragon Slayer Guild anymore.” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother said with relief. 
Scar and the others pondered for a moment, then nodded, “You’re right. Although the Dragon Slayer Guild has slaughtered many of us ancient dragons, they violated the original Dragon King’s principles. They only targeted evil dragons, who were unforgivable anyway.” 
From their focus on hunting only malevolent creatures, it was clear that the One-Eyed Owl was not bloodthirsty. 
She simply used justice to channel her natural aggression. 
This was true for most members of the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Listening to the dragons’ words, a smile spread across Lin Tian’s face. 
Once he saved Osius and Grugia, those two fellows, he wondered what expressions they would have. 
It was about time he gave them a good dose of humiliation!
