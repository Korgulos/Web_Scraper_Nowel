Chapter 57: Tier 7 Monster · Minotaur Demon! 
TL: Sungmin  
Subsequently, the corpses were not wasted and were thoroughly consumed. 
With this wave, the number of hero variants grew from 20 to 40. 
Still far from reaching hundreds. 
“Hmph, if you insist on obstructing me from reclaiming the corpses, don’t blame me for exterminating you all,” Lin Tian said with hatred in his eyes. 
This time, he absolutely wanted the Sword Saintess to feel what a real blow was! 
In the Great Tomb Forest. 
Brutal, severely injured, finally returned to his Beast King Tribe. 
Unfortunately, only a few Small Goblins remained. 
Brutal roared in anger for a long time! 
Then, he walked deeper into the forest. 
In this world’s largest enchanted forest, humans were forbidden to step foot! 
Countless powerful monsters lived here. 
Tier 5 monsters roamed everywhere, and Tier 6 monsters were as numerous as dogs. 
Among them were four Tier 10 monsters, occupying the four corners of the forest. 
But they were also subordinates of the Great Tomb. 
Brutal ranked nowhere here, and he couldn’t possibly enter the Great Tomb to meet the real ‘monsters’ inside. 
Instead, he could only obediently find his superior. 
The ‘Minotaur Demon’ tribe. 
Brutal carefully crossed the forest, even though he was afraid, because many powerful but extremely low-intelligence monsters lived here. 
They were the truly ferocious ones that would kill any living thing in their sight. 
Before long, he arrived at a small mountain. 
The entire mountain had been hollowed out, where the Minotaur Demons lived. 
“Mr. Bull, I am the leader of the Beast King Tribe, are you at home?” 
Standing outside the cave, Brutal obediently asked, like a well-behaved child. 
He didn’t dare to go in rashly; otherwise, he wouldn’t know how he died. 
“Boom, boom, boom.” 
Inside the cave, a rumbling sound of the ground shaking echoed. 
Something enormous walked out. 
In the dark night, those two crimson eyes were positioned very high, at least four or five meters up! 
The figure was estimated to be twice as large as Brutal. 
In comparison, Brutal really was just like a baby. 
A gigantic monster with a bull’s face and a human body finally emerged. 
It had huge horns on its head, its body was covered in bulging muscles, dense black fur, and it had a long tail. 
Its feet were in the shape of hooves, and its hands were similar to those of humans. 
Though bulls were said to be honest and kind, the Minotaur Demons were known for their ferocity! 
They often went outside to slaughter humans and bring them back to eat. 
Goblins, comparatively, could eat other foods, with humans most appealing due to their excellent females. 
The meat wasn’t actually that favored. 
But Minotaur Demons were different; they had a generational habit of eating humans. 
They also had a nickname, ‘Cannibals.’ 
“You evolved?” 
The Minotaur Demon showed slight surprise upon seeing Brutal, but soon regained his calm. 
Even if Brutal had evolved, he was still no match. 
Minotaur Demons generally had Tier 5-6 strength, but this Minotaur Demon leader, Big Bull Li, was a Tier 7 entity. 
[Big Bull Li, Lv80<br/>
Race: Minotaur Demon<br/>
Profession: Berserker<br/>
Title: Tier 7 Monster, Cannibal<br/>
Health: 2300<br/>
Strength: 660<br/>
Defense: 700<br/>
Skills: Brute Force, Charging Horns, Demonization<br/>
Equipment: None<br/>
Overall: 3500] 
Although his overall strength was only four hundred more than peak Brutal. 
Once crossing the threshold of three thousand, every point of overall combat power became extremely difficult to increase, making the gap significant. 
Brutal honestly said, “Just evolved, but almost got killed by a group of humans.” 
“Humans? You left the Great Tomb?” 
The Minotaur Demon’s eyes instantly focused as he asked. 
If someone of such strength was almost killed, the humans they provoked must be very strong. 
Brutal awkwardly nodded, “Yes, but I went to retrieve something that belonged to me. They not only stole it but also killed my entire tribe.” 
As he spoke, he took out the Tier 7 Feitu Magic Ring. 
Seeing such a magical item, even the Minotaur Demon was tempted. 
But he didn’t expect Brutal to directly present it, “This is a magical item made by the Ghoul Tribe, part of your half-demon kin. If I give it to you, it can be considered returning it to its rightful owner.” 
The Minotaur Demon slightly smiled, “Hmph, speak, what do you want?” 
“Help me, kill them!” 
In an instant, Brutal’s eyes were filled with sinister malice! 
Hearing this, the Minotaur Demon thought for a moment, “We have an agreement with the Holy Church, not to step foot in human territory…  
But I can apply to the Lord. If it’s for revenge, he should agree. Wait here.” 
After saying that, the Minotaur Demon leaped dozens of meters away, quickly departing. 
In just a few minutes, he jumped back, his speed extremely fast and eerie! 
The Minotaur Demon coldly smiled, licking his lips with a savoring expression, “The Lord agreed. Finally, I can taste fresh blood and flesh again.” 
Had it not been for the long time since he last ate humans, he wouldn’t have wanted to do this. 
Moreover, the ring was also offered to the local lord. 
However, being able to reasonably go out to eat humans was enough. 
With a bull roar, dozens of Minotaur Demons emerged from the cave! 
Their bodies were about the same size as Brutal’s, with an overall power around 2000. 
Their strength was already very formidable. 
“I can’t wait any longer, lead the way!” Big Bull Li urged. 
In his eyes was a greedy and eager hunger for flesh! 
… 
In the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
Lin Tian had already mastered the proficiency of using the Blood of Ruin, and his level had been raised to 70. 
[Lin Tian: Lv70<br/>
Race: Goblin<br/>
Profession: None<br/>
Title: Blasphemer, Potential God, God’s Blessing<br/>
Health: 2000<br/>

Defense: 710<br/>
Skills: Abnormal Fusion, Blood of Ruin, Ruinous Howl, No-Blade Capture, Keen…<br/>
Equipment: Fine Iron Armor, Fine Short Sword, Elemental Hand Crossbow<br/>
Overall: 3100] 
His strength had increased, but it was still difficult to reach the same level as the Sword Saintess. 
Even if his overall power reached 4000, he might not be able to defeat her. 
Thus, Lin Tian always played dirty. 
“It seems I have to join forces with Brutal to deal with her. Who asked to make my starting difficulty hell mode?” Lin Tian said with a bitter smile. 
Who else faced a boss like the Sword Saintess, capable of instantly killing him at the beginning? 
Otherwise, he would have swept through everything long ago, without needing to be so cautious. 
But now, he was finally on the verge of emerging victorious. 
As long as they wiped out Bright Town in this joint attack, they could form an entire army of hero variants! 
No more need to hide. 
At this moment, Goblin Slayer asked, “Do we need to go together later?” 
“No, I can escape when needed. This battle is mainly against the strong ones like the Sword Saintess,” Lin Tian replied. 
Having others there could lead to unnecessary casualties. 
He didn’t even need to go personally, but he feared Brutal and his group might not be strong enough to take down the Sword Saintess. 
He had to eliminate this thorn. 
A few days later. 
Brutal’s voice echoed at the cave entrance, “King, I am back.” 
“Just listen to him then,” Goblin Slayer replied, and Lin Tian walked out next. 
Brutal looked at him and remembered the battle that day, but instead of being angry, he was very respectful, “Let’s go.” 
This was the unchallengeable royal command. 
The moment Lin Tian stepped out, he saw dozens of huge, demonically-imbued Minotaur Demons! 
Those pairs of eyes sent chills down his spine! 
Big Bull Li asked in confusion, “Brutal, the friend you mentioned is this low-level goblin? Is your brain broken or are my eyes failing?” 
He had expected a Tier 7 Overlord Goblin. 
At worst, a Tier 6 one. 
Instead, it was less impressive than a pile of dog shit. 
“Mr. Bull, rest assured, his strength is about the same as mine,” Brutal said indifferently, continuing to lead the way. 
Since he said so, Big Bull Li asked no more questions. 
His mind was only filled with thoughts of eating humans. 
Following behind from a distance, Lin Tian couldn’t help but remark, “Good heavens, he found a group of minotaurs?” 
Although he himself had done many minotaur-like things, he didn’t have any good feelings towards minotaurs. 
This was the Minotaur Law: 
Better I deceive everyone than let everyone deceive me. 
Overall, this group of minotaurs was indeed very strong. 
Soon, they arrived at a small hill outside Bright Town, cautiously hiding. 
The soldiers were patrolling. 
Brutal pointed ahead, full of hatred, “That’s the place. But I must tell you, there’s a notorious woman with a sword there, very fierce and strong.” 
“Hmph, I like strong food,” Big Bull Li directly pushed the cautious Brutal aside and walked towards Bright Town. 
The group of Minotaur Demons followed suit. 
They had no intention of hiding. 
In the distance, several patrolling soldiers were puzzled, “What’s going on, an earthquake?” 
“Look over there! Behind the hill!” 
“It’s Minotaur Demons! So many Minotaur Demons are coming!!” 
Hearing the words Minotaur Demon, the soldiers were scared and immediately ran! 
These infamous cannibals had harmed countless villages. 
Who didn’t know? 
Thanks to the Church, they were forced into the Great Tomb and dared not come out easily. 
Who would have thought they’d encounter so many here! 
Seeing this, Lin Tian secretly thought, “Are they really that scary? However, I think goblins are much more terrifying than any Minotaur Demon.” 
Although goblins weren’t particularly strong now, only the high-tier intelligent ones were powerful. 
But if they captured Bright Town, Lin Tian planned to greatly develop low-level goblins. 
Establish a city. 
Use quantity to create a qualitative change. 
At this time, the Minotaur Demons leaped from the hill! 
They landed heavily in Bright Town, crushing countless houses and buildings! 
Big Bull Li jumped directly into a tavern, crushing several soldiers still drinking. 
Seeing the sudden monster, the other soldiers sobered up instantly! 
They picked up their weapons and began to fight back. 
But in the next second, Big Bull Li grabbed one and stuffed him into his mouth, chewing him, iron armor and all! 
Good teeth were indeed a blessing. 
He began to feast right there. 
The other Minotaur Demons did the same, their goal not being slaughter but simply to eat. 
Catching a person, they sat down comfortably and began to savor. 
Regardless of the soldiers attacking them, they focused on filling their bellies. 
Brutal also entered Bright Town, searching for the Sword Saintess and others. 
At this moment, that familiar underground tremor was felt! 
He quickly retreated to the side. 
Marshall emerged with a long spear! 
Immediately after, Austin came out of a house, and Emma had already reached the highest bell tower. 
“Swish!” 
A sword qi slashed through, splitting a Minotaur Demon in half! 
It saved the tavern owner. 
Frightened, he quickly escaped, gratefully shouting, “Sword Saintess!” 
Alicenia also came out of her room, fully armored. 
Felomon quickly ordered, “All soldiers, don’t panic! Gather around me!” 
If they panicked, it would be a one-sided massacre. 
Soon, everyone distanced themselves from the Minotaur Demons, while the residents and weaker adventurers fled the town. 
The Minotaur Demons sat in place, savoring their tasty morsels.
