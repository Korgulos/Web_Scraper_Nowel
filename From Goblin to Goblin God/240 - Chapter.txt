Chapter 240: Alice Awakens Again, The Power of the Divine! 
TL: Sungmin  
The hybrid goblins all began to take action. 
Lin Tian and Alice stood in place, waiting for news. 
As he looked through the pitch-black gaps between the trees, Lin Tian furrowed his brows slightly. 
This feeling reminded him a bit of standing at the edge of the Great Tomb, gazing into the Abyss of Nothingness! 
Bottomless! 
It was as if a pair of eyes inside were watching him. 
Instantly, he felt his scalp tingle! 
Alice, on alert, said, “Even though we haven’t seen a single monster yet, the immense aura coming from within… the weakest would be at least tenth-tier, and there might even be Demon Kings…” 
Lin Tian also felt the aura. 
Within a radius of tens of kilometers, there were at least several powerful monsters and Demon Kings. 
It was truly terrifying. 
No wonder the continent within the Uninhabited Zone was called a barren wilderness. 
There weren’t even many Demon Kings here. The demigod Joan of Arc had also come from the world outside the Uninhabited Zone. 
One after another, many hybrid goblins came to report. 
“Boss, there’s a massive tomb about ten kilometers along the forest’s edge!” 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian immediately moved. 
But after digging it up, he found only white bones. 
It was clearly a mass grave. 
It might even have been a burial site for bodies that had died in a plague near the edge of the region. 
The fact that monsters hadn’t eaten the corpses made it very likely they had died from a contagious disease. 
Lin Tian cursed under his breath, “Damn it, keep looking!” 
Fortunately, it had been a long time ago, and the virus had long since died out. 
Otherwise, catching a plague—this kind of real virus—would have been unbearable. 
For now, only purification magic could treat diseases. 
Healing magic couldn’t kill viruses. 
As for the medical level, there was no need to mention it—it was helpless against plagues. 
Finally. 
There was a new discovery by evening. 
“Boss, I found it while I was, uh… relieving myself behind a big rock. It looks like a tomb, but I wasn’t sure,” said a hybrid goblin awkwardly. 
Lin Tian frowned, “You better not have taken a dump on someone’s grave. If a vengeful spirit comes after you, don’t come crying to me.” 
The goblin shuddered at the thought of vengeful spirits. “No, no, I haven’t gone yet. I’m still holding it in, see? It’s over there, Boss.” 
Under the moonlight. 
A giant moss-covered stone appeared at the edge of a forested ravine. 
On the ground around the stone, more than a dozen rusted swords were thrust into the soil, almost looking like old stumps to anyone unaware. 
“It’s definitely a sword tomb,” Alice confirmed. 
When knights died and their bodies weren’t found, it was customary to erect a sword tomb as a memorial. 
Beneath the swords, they would bury the knight’s clothing and personal items. 
Lin Tian studied the large stone carefully, “There are inscriptions on it. They record these people’s deeds and causes of death. It seems to be about an expeditionary knight order… their leader, Covena, who killed seventeen Demon Kings and one Great Demon King…” 
With that level of power, they must have mastered world-class sword skills. 
“Hey, you, go ahead and start digging,” Lin Tian ordered the goblin guide. 
But the goblin wore a bitter expression, “Boss, I… I can’t hold it in much longer. And if I start digging and a vengeful spirit curses me… You’re strong, so you don’t fear them, but…” 
Lin Tian chuckled coldly, “You’ve got some nerve, huh? Ignoring my orders?” 
After all, Lin Tian wasn’t the Goblin King. 
He didn’t have the Call skill. 
The only reason they obeyed him was because of his overwhelming strength. 
That was the nature of goblins. 
If they could defeat Lin Tian, they’d immediately turn on him. 
Of course, they’d never have that chance. 
“Start digging!” Lin Tian commanded sharply, scaring the goblin so much his body clenched. 
He hurriedly began scraping the dirt with his claws. 
Being cursed by a vengeful spirit might kill him, but disobeying would definitely kill him. 
Soon, thin wooden coffins began to emerge from the earth. 
Western-style coffins were far lighter and smaller than their Eastern counterparts—more like simple wooden boxes. 
Just big enough to hold a single person. 
In the end, the hybrid goblins unearthed fourteen coffins and lined them up on the ground. 
“Boss, can I go relieve myself now?”  
The hybrid goblin, drenched in cold sweat, was barely holding on. 
Lin Tian waved his hand, signaling him to leave. 
Immediately, the goblin bolted as if injected with adrenaline. Vengeful spirits? He wouldn’t wait around to die! 
But he had barely run a few dozen meters. 
A burning bullet pierced through his chest! The wound around his heart was scorched black, with small embers still glowing. 
It was Lin Tian, using his Elemental Hand Crossbow. 
He never left goblins with rebellious tendencies alive. 
Crack! 
Just then, the sound of a wooden plank breaking echoed through the air. 
Alice pried open one of the coffins, and the musty smell immediately wafted out. 
Unfortunately, there wasn’t much inside. 
Just a few pieces of clothing, already rotting away, and some strange objects. 
Perhaps they were antiques, but in this world, antiques were worthless. 
She continued to open several more coffins, but all contained only clothes and some burial goods. No magic books. 
Until the last one was opened. 
A swarm of strange, disgusting bugs crawled out. 
The inside was completely empty, with nothing of value. 
Lin Tian sighed with a heavy heart, “It seems we were too naive. A world-class sword technique or magic book—even if it existed, it would never be buried as a grave good. It’s much more likely to have been sold off.” 
Alice let out a soft sigh, “Let’s just forget it. You’ve already done so much for me, and I’m truly content. From a young age, I was always taught how to help others, but this is the first time I’ve ever felt such warmth…” 
They had been busy all day, and it was now late into the night. 
A thick layer of white fog began to rise all around, reducing visibility to almost nothing. 
“Damn, don’t tell me there really are vengeful spirits coming for us? Hey, ghost brothers, I already killed the goblin that dug up your grave. You should be thanking me, not haunting me!”  
Lin Tian glanced around warily, feeling goosebumps creep up his arms. 
It felt like countless eyes were watching him from the darkness. 
In truth, he wasn’t afraid of ghosts themselves, just the idea of one suddenly appearing and scaring him. 
However, Alice softly said, “Lin Tian, actually, I feel like this fog came at the perfect time, don’t you think…” 
For a moment. 
Lin Tian didn’t notice that Alice had moved to stand directly in front of him, her eyes dreamy, and her warm breath clearly audible. 
“It’s been more than half a year since the last time we… I, I’m not like others who can take care of it on their own. I only want you…”  
A blush spread across Alice’s face as she leaned in and kissed Lin Tian. 
The fog provided her the perfect cover. 
No need to worry about anyone seeing, allowing her to fully express her desires. 
Since things had already come this far. 
Lin Tian, naturally, did not refuse. 
The night grew darker. 
The surrounding insects chirped like a natural symphony, their sounds rising and falling in waves. 
Just as they finished, Alice’s previously dazed expression suddenly sharpened into perfect clarity! 
In fact, her eyes even gleamed with a golden light! 
Lin Tian was dumbfounded. “Whoa, wait, how hyped up are you? Your eyes are literally glowing gold!” 
He was utterly shocked. 
The feeling of male pride surged within him! 
He stood straight, as if his back had become a perfect ninety degrees. 
But Alice explained, “No, no, that’s not what I meant. I think… I’ve awakened my former power! The power of the Divine!”
