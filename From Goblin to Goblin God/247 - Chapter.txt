Chapter 247: Flower Fairy 
TL: Sungmin  
Lin Tian had long grown tired of hearing the sentiments of these male demi-humans. 
What mattered most was finding the Lust Demon King, and if he could mate with her, not only would it increase his power, but it would also allow him to exact revenge on that wretch. 
Sure enough. 
Before long, a sultry female highland sheep demi-human slowly sat down next to Lin Tian. 
The cuteness of the sheepfolk was undeniable. 
Her round, chubby face and drooping ears were incredibly endearing. 
Her body resembled that of a half-beast. 
She was covered in a thin layer of white wool, just enough to hide her important parts, like a natural garment. 
Her collarbones were stark white and captivating, making it hard for anyone to look away. 
Behind her, a small tail wagged rapidly out of embarrassment. 
“Your Goblin Majesty, p-please don’t stare at me like that,” the highland sheep said, blushing as she lowered her head. 
Lin Tian tried using the system to check her stats. Unsurprisingly, she was just a highland sheep. 
He still couldn’t see through the Lust Demon King Scarlett’s true form. 
However, based on the system’s analysis, given that women continued to approach him despite knowing he was a woman-killer, there was a strong likelihood this was Scarlett. 
Additionally, every time the deed was done, they would flee in panic, suggesting they feared their magic might wear off and reveal their true form. 
As for why they kept trying, it was likely because Scarlett couldn’t understand why, despite engaging in intercourse, she couldn’t activate the “Forbidden Soul Steal” skill. 
Forbidden Soul Steal was one of Scarlett’s exclusive abilities. 
It could only be triggered during forbidden, passionate love, allowing her to steal both the soul and power of her target. 
That’s why Lin Tian planned to strike first, instead of just satisfying his desires. 
This would prevent her skill from identifying him as a victim. 
After all, who would expect to be harmed in such a way? 
“Little one, alone so late at night?” Lin Tian teased intentionally. 
The highland sheep’s gaze grew nervous, her eyes darting away as she stammered, “I-I heard you were here, so I came to visit… Our highland sheep tribe has always admired you…” 
To a normal person, her demeanor and reaction wouldn’t seem like an act. 
But Lin Tian had witnessed Scarlett’s tricks before. The more convincing it looked, the more suspicious it was. 
Without beating around the bush, he bluntly said, “I love eating mutton. Its gamey flavor… Do you… want me to… eat… you?” 
He deliberately drew out the last few words. 
The highland sheep’s heart pounded wildly, and she nodded. 
The two of them headed upstairs. 
“Wham!” 
As soon as Lin Tian left the room. 
A Wild Rhino demi-human slammed the table in frustration, “What the hell, picking up women like that?! Why?! It’s not fair!” 
“Got it! Bunny girl, do you… want me to… eat… you?” A nearby lizard-headed demi-human mimicked, pretending to be deeply affectionate. 
Immediately, the bunny girl rolled her eyes at him. “Idiot…” 
The other demi-humans drinking together were both furious and resigned. 
They were absolutely floored by Lin Tian’s audacity. 
However. 
Suddenly, from upstairs, a horrifying scream came from the highland sheep, tearing through the peaceful night! 
The Wild Rhino demi-human sighed, “That sound! I’m so envious!” 
“Just listen to that!” A striped female zebra nudged her husband in frustration, complaining. 
The lizard-headed demi-human raised his glass, downing it in one go, and sighed, “If you don’t have what it takes, don’t even think about it. Just earn some gold and head to the succubus den. That’s good enough!” 
Upstairs. 
The bed was in complete disarray. 
Lin Tian stood by the window, watching as the highland sheep broke through the window and fled, her body sizzling with smoke. A wicked smile crept across his lips. 
“Congratulations, Host! Your aptitude has improved! Health +100, Strength +30, Defense +30!” 
It was almost certain now that the highland sheep had been the Lust Demon King Scarlett. 
And it was also clear that he was immune to her Forbidden Soul Steal attack. 
“I’ve been worried about my limited power growth… Looks like I’ll be able to improve nicely now, heheh~” 
Lin Tian’s eyes were filled with greed as he gazed in the direction Scarlett had fled into the night. 
She was sure to come back. 
And every time she returned, she would change her disguise, often mimicking beings from uncharted areas that neither he nor anyone else had encountered. 
This meant that every time, he’d unlock new races, allowing him to grow stronger. 
It couldn’t be more perfect! 
Not only did it feel good, but it also made him stronger—goblins were truly amazing. 
… 
In the dark night. 
The highland sheep’s body began sizzling and shedding its form, revealing a bikini-clad demon covered in vulgar tattoos. 
She was none other than the Lust Demon King Scarlett. 
After taking a few steps, her legs gave way. Thankfully, there was a nearby tree to lean against; otherwise, she would have collapsed onto the ground. 
The intense pain caused cold sweat to pour down her forehead. 
Her pupils trembled! 
“It hurts! It hurts so much! What’s happening?! What did he do to me?! It’s like… like I’ve been pierced through!” Scarlett cried out in pain, tears streaming down her face as she whimpered like a helpless little girl. 
Scarlett continued, “Why was Forbidden Soul Steal ineffective on him? Could it be… Could it be that even such a cute race as the Highland Sheep isn’t enough to move his heart? Then again… As a king, he surely isn’t lacking in women. Maybe a Highland Sheep doesn’t tempt him anymore…” 
“Hiss! But… it hurts so much, ugh, damn goblin! Next time, I’ll make sure you regret this!!!” 
She quickly activated healing magic to tend to her ‘sister’ below. 
… 
The next day. 
Back at Tavern No. 7. 
Lin Tian sat there, eagerly waiting for Scarlett to present herself again. 
He was curious about what kind of demi-human girl she’d turn into this time. 
Though he had little regard for weak or unimpressive types. 
Still, anything crafted by Scarlett was bound to be top-notch. 
There was some excitement in that. 
Besides, it would boost his combat power. 
Even if the gains were small, they’d accumulate over time. 
“Whoa! Look at the entrance—what kind of race is that? Incredible!” someone shouted. 
“Looks like an outsider.” 
“I’ve heard of this one—it’s a Flower Fairy! Such a noble race, why would she come to a place like this?!” 
“A Flower Fairy?! I’ve heard that many Demon Kings specifically seek Flower Fairies to marry! They make amazing wives, not just for fun!” 
Behind Lin Tian, the same male demi-humans from yesterday were gathered, drinking as usual. 
Rhino-head, lizard-head, it didn’t matter—they were all staring fixedly at the entrance. 
At that moment. 
A delicate hand gently tapped Lin Tian on the shoulder. “Excuse me, could you lend me a gold coin to buy a drink? I just arrived here and have nothing on me. I’m terribly sorry.” 
It was the Flower Fairy who had just walked in. 
Her dress flowed like the petals of a rose, sensual and striking. Her exquisite features radiated nobility and elegance. 
Every movement and gesture was filled with grace and decorum. 
She was, without a doubt, a true Flower Fairy. 
Among ten thousand flower spirits, only one Flower Fairy would emerge! 
Her beauty was so overwhelming that no one dared entertain any wicked thoughts—self-doubt would quickly take over an ordinary person’s mind. 
They would think they weren’t worthy of her. 
Lin Tian turned around to size her up. He’d heard of Flower Fairies before, but this was his first time seeing one! 
Indeed, she gave off the vibe of an imperial noblewoman. 
As he and everyone else were completely captivated by her presence. 
The Flower Fairy smirked to herself, thinking, “Hmph, today, I refuse to believe I can’t take you down! You’ll obediently let me steal your soul and become my slave, Goblin!”
