Chapter 136: Powerful Coordination Ability, The Army Arrives! 
TL: Sungmin 
Lia shot arrows from a distance, but even if she hit her target, they would be caught by hand. 
The power gap was too great. 
She now had around 6,000 combat power, while Steven had more than 8,000. 
At this moment. 
Gobu Tian, who had been hiding in a ground crack, launched a surprise attack! 
Remaining still in the shadows made him invisible; no one had noticed, assuming he had just fallen. 
His ambush skill, during the three seconds of becoming visible, could deal double damage. 
His combat power was just shy of 7,000, but double damage was enough to injure an opponent with over 8,000. 
“Thud!” 
The Void Dagger stabbed out, but unfortunately missed the heart, only piercing Steven’s kidney thoroughly. 
Ignoring the pain, Steven grabbed Gobu Tian’s neck, “Brother, move!” 
Upon hearing this, Steve rushed forward, stabbing Gobu Tian’s head with a sword! 
The sword was enchanted with explosive elements, detonating on the spot! 
Blown to pieces. 
“One down, keep going!” Stephen was very pleased to see their success.  
“Ultimate Roar!!— Roar!” 
Suddenly, Lin Tian launched a surprise attack on them, despite being more than twenty meters away. 
Thanks to the King’s Domain enhancement. 
All three were instantly paralyzed. 
At that moment, a figure once again sprang from the shadows! 
This time, it precisely pierced Steven’s heart, the Void Dagger’s ability activated, devouring and consuming the heart, even the gods couldn’t save him! 
He had just used Shadow Strike, summoning a shadow to attack. 
Though the shadow’s death would injure the user, the enhanced version prevented backlash. 
“Move, move, move!” 
“Boom!” 
An ultimate dark beam shot over! 
It blasted Steve hundreds of meters away on the spot! 
By this time, Stephen had recovered, it took merely a second or so. 
He quickly slashed at the beam beside him, interrupting the skill and saving Steve. 
Suddenly, he saw Steven with a large hole in his chest, collapsing straight into the ground crack. 
He never expected his brother to die! 
In just a second or so! 
And the goblin they had clearly killed was still alive! 
“Damn it, these goblins have such terrifying coordination, and the magic underfoot seems to be weakening my power…” 
Stephen analyzed through his grief. 
He finally decided to eliminate Gobu Kuang first. 
This was also the wisest analysis, “Gilbert, you two come help me!” 
“Coming!” 
The two reluctantly complied, initially planning to find a chance to take down Edward. 
But eliminating the goblins was the immediate priority. 
Lin Tian frowned slightly; these two looked unserious but were far more threatening than the previous pair. 
Because together they could use world-class magic. 
For those below level 99, world-class magic was on another level! 
“First take out the weaker thin one. We can’t let any survive.” Lin Tian said with a heavy expression. 
Gobu Kuang nodded, and Gobu Tian also jumped into the crack in the ground, slowly approaching them. 
As a result. 
Stephen gave a powerful shake, causing the crack to close, though not seamlessly. 
It buried Gobu Tian, making it difficult for him to escape. 
“Hmph, the same trick won’t work on me twice!” 
Stephen said coldly, as if seeing the scales of victory tilt. 
Gilbert’s eyes shifted, “Master, we’ll help you control those two goblins, you go finish them off.” 
“Alright.” 
“Come on, brother! World-class magic·Giant Vine Cage!” 
“Boom!” 
Massive vines erupted from the ground, tightly surrounding Lin Tian and the others. 
It was like a growing wall, restricting their movement more and more; touching the vines would even poison them. 
Lin Tian wouldn’t choose to sit and wait. 
During their skill activation stiffness, he used a skill stolen from the system earlier. 
“Anubis’ Soul Harvest!” 
A blue jackal-headed phantom appeared, ignoring the vines, soaring into the sky, a towering figure over ten meters tall! 
Wielding a giant axe, it slashed heavily at Gilbert! 
It shattered his soul into pieces on the spot, requiring ten seconds to reconstitute. 
Taking this opportunity, Lin Tian donned the Life Armor and began digging through the vines with the Spear of Zeus. 
He fled backward. 
The Life Armor could immunize the poison from the vine’s touch, allowing him to dig dozens of meters before finally seeing light. 
The vines were too large; if fully grown, even gods would be trapped. 
The key was to dig; behind him, the vines were quickly healing. 
Absorbing the nutrients from the soil, they grew rapidly. 
It was impossible not to marvel at the terror of world-class skills. 
Gobu Kuang barely escaped disaster by closely following Lin Tian. 
“Goblin Majesty! We have arrived!” 
In the distance, the sound of hooves echoed as Fiona’s heroic figure appeared, holding a long spear with great majesty! 
Behind her was an army of over a hundred thousand goblins. 
Lin Tian revealed a sinister smile, “Perfect timing, it’s time to turn the tide!” 
Gradually, the vines disappeared. 
Lin Tian walked back to confront them directly. 
Gilbert sneered with disdain, “Hmph, weren’t you arrogant before? Sweating like a pig just now! Hahaha!” 
“Your head is mine!” 
Stephen was about to charge but then looked towards the slope behind him. A striking figure appeared along with the sound of hooves. 
Fiona’s imposing gaze froze him in place. 
“Centaurs?! I thought they were extinct, wait, don’t tell me she’s with that goblin?” Stephen’s expression turned serious. 
The centaur race was brave and strong in battle. 
In their current state, facing a centaur would likely result in defeat. 
However, Lin Tian swung the Spear of Zeus forward, “Charge! Overwhelm them!!!” 
“Kill!!!” One by one, goblins roared with mouths full of sharp teeth! 
They charged with great momentum, without any fear! 
Even if they were low-level goblins, their sheer number would exhaust their enemies to death! 
Although skills could kill many at once, overusing them would deplete their mana, leaving them exhausted and defenseless, like fish on a chopping block. 
If they had to fight one by one, who knew when it would end. 
Thus, even weak soldiers could transform through quantity. 
Stephen and his group had not even reacted before being overwhelmed. 
In the distance, Katheryn still cast wide-area healing magic, healing the wounds of the low-level goblins. 
Gilbert and his brother, due to their insufficient level to use world-class magic, required an additional fusion spell, consuming a large amount of mana. 
They couldn’t use many more skills. 
“Get off me! I need to escape!” 
Gilbert kicked frantically, with at least three or four goblins crawling on his legs, causing excruciating pain. 
His mana was almost depleted, leaving just enough for an escape spell. 
But with goblins clinging to his legs, even using magic wouldn’t make him fast. 
That was the drawback of mages—once their mana was exhausted, they were weaker than average fighters. 
“Brother! Your legs!!” At this moment, Gilberts screamed in terror. 
Gilbert was confused, “What are you panicking about? Help me, we need to escape together! Damn goblins don’t play fair, didn’t we agree on a duel?!” 
He looked down. 
The sight nearly scared him to death! 
His legs were nothing but bare bones, with only a few scraps of flesh clinging. 
He could see white tendons stuck in goblin teeth, unable to be chewed. 
“Ahhhh!” Gilbert collapsed in shock, his mind blank! 
These goblins secreted toxins, numbing his legs, so he couldn’t feel the pain. 
But the sight alone almost scared him to death. 
He soiled his pants completely! 
“Save me, brother! I don’t want to die!!!” 
Gilbert’s voice trembled with fear, hysterical. 
But as he fell, the goblins completely overwhelmed him. 
Gilberts backed away in terror, “I have to escape!” 
Suddenly, a shadow emerged from the ground, piercing his leg. 
It was Gobu Tian, “Where are you going?” 
He dragged Gilberts into the ground hole. 
“Ahhh!!!” 
Only his screams echoed from within. 
Nearby, Stephen was also struggling. Although his axe could kill two or three low-level goblins with each swing, 
After swinging it hundreds of times, he was exhausted. 
With five hundred swings, killing three goblins per swing, he had already killed a lot. 
Having killed only about fifteen hundred goblins, he had reached his limit. 
The magic attacks had only killed around thirty thousand. 
But now, with only his hands and weapon left, facing over a hundred thousand goblins, there was no chance of victory! 
“Brother!” 
In the distance, Steve, who had been blasted away, rushed back. 
“Run! These goblins are far stronger than we imagined! Let the boss come and wipe them out herself!” Stephen shouted urgently. 
But it was too late. 
Lin Tian glanced sideways, “How about lending a hand?” 
“Huh? Goblin Majesty, when we joined the empire, weren’t there no such conditions?” Fiona playfully remarked. 
But then she raised her slender red spear high. 
She charged at Stephen! 
Each step seemed to strike his soul! 
Her brave spear was burning with a fierce red light! 
The brave spirit ignited! 
“Damn! A centaur!” 
Seeing this, Steve turned and ran. 
But how could he outrun a centaur? 
“Thud!” 
A fierce thrust pierced his back, his counterattack missing entirely as she dodged. 
He could only suffer as he was repeatedly stabbed, turning into a bloody mess! 
Until he died on the spot. 
This was the suppression cavalry had over infantry. 
Stephen saw this scene, letting goblins climb all over him, some even grabbing his ears and stepping on his shoulders, climbing to his head. 
He merely smiled weakly, eventually being submerged in the goblin tide, 
Not even bones were left uneaten. 
He had long expected such an end, choosing to accept it calmly. 
No cries of despair. 
Otherwise, why join the Dragon Slayer Guild? He could have hidden away to survive. 
On the other hand, 
Edward was battling Alice fiercely. 
“What’s the meaning of this? The duel letter clearly stated a one-on-one fight, why are there so many goblins!”
