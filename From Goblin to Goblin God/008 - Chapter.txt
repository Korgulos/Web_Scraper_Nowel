Chapter 8: Hell! The Disaster of the Elves 
TL: Sungmin 
Cassandra suddenly felt a sharp pain in her buttocks. Her small face turned bright red as she finally couldn’t hold back and screamed, “Pain, pain, pain, pain, pain!” 
She quickly pulled out the arrow and looked down. 
“So it’s you, you damn goblin! I must get rid of you!” 
Seeing this, Cassandra was filled with shame and anger. She drew her bow and aimed at Lin Tian. 
To everyone’s surprise, she not only didn’t plan to escape but also intended to deal with these goblins herself. 
Lin Tian immediately started to dodge everywhere, and she followed him closely. 
Relying on her agile movements, she was very confident on the treetops. 
She even chased him deep into the tribe, looking down from above. “A bunch of low-level monsters, you dare to attack our elf tribe? You must be out of your minds. No, you don’t even have brains!” 
“Whoosh, whoosh!” 
As she spoke, she began to shoot arrows. 
Her arrows never missed their target! 
However, the goblins she hit were not dead, just injured. 
Cassandra was somewhat surprised, “Why didn’t they die in one shot? In that case, I’ll just shoot two arrows!” 
“Enemy invasion! Up there!” 
A goblin shouted, and immediately, all the goblins began to scatter and hide. 
They had no way to attack the elf on the treetops and could only flee like rats. 
Seeing this, Cassandra was very pleased, “Hmph, do you see how powerful I am? Today, I’m going to kill you all, and Mother will definitely praise me!” 
In the mindset of the elves, goblins were the lowest creatures and extremely evil. 
Whenever they encountered one, they had to kill it. 
Just like humans would stomp on cockroaches when they see them. 
“I’ll shoot you to death, I’ll shoot you to death. Where’s that one who attacked my butt earlier? Today, I’m going to shoot you to death!” 
Cassandra said angrily. The bowstring hummed continuously, and arrows flew out rapidly! 
Many goblins were hit. 
Lin Tian estimated the time was about right and slowly walked out, standing still. 
Cassandra, furious, prepared to draw her bow again, aiming at Lin Tian’s head! 
She shot an arrow! 
The goblins watching were terrified, “Boss!” 
“Whoosh!” 
The arrow flew past, merely grazing Lin Tian’s head, but not hitting him. 
Cassandra’s expression changed slightly, “How is that possible? Ah, my hand, it feels weak. This is bad…” 
As she spoke, she clutched her head, feeling dizzy. She stumbled and fell from the tree. 
Although falling from a height of more than ten meters wouldn’t kill her, she was badly injured and looked extremely pathetic. 
Her stealth suit got caught on the treetops, revealing her entire appearance. 
She was about 1.6 meters tall, extremely slim, with skin as white as jade. Describing her as ethereal would not be an exaggeration. 
Her long legs seemed to be crafted by the gods. The silken clothes clung to her body, outlining the most beautiful curves in the world. 
Combined with Cassandra’s struggling expression, she looked like a fairy who had fallen to the mortal world. 
Seeing this, a group of goblins went crazy and rushed over, their eyes all emitting an excited red light! Ninety percent of them already had strong reactions! 
They had been drooling over elves for who knows how long! 
But with Lin Tian around, they all held back and didn’t pounce. 
Lin Tian slowly approached, his eyes also lighting up as he looked at her figure! 
He sneered, “Finally caught you. You were the one shooting arrows at me earlier?” 
“I… I… Damn goblin, what did you do to me?” 
Cassandra used all her strength but couldn’t move at all. Her whole body was paralyzed. 
Lin Tian didn’t explain. Instead, he said to himself, “Since you wanted to shoot me to death earlier, I’m sorry, but I believe in an eye for an eye!” 
He extended his claws and hooked them! 
“Rip!” 
The silken clothes she wore were torn open! 
Her skin was white as snow, as delicate as could be, and glistening with moisture. 
“Help! Mother, brother, father! How could this happen? It’s just a group of goblins, how could I…” 
Cassandra cried out in fear, but there was nothing she could do. 
In front of all the goblins, Lin Tian began to do to Cassandra what she had done earlier. 
“Ding! Congratulations on increasing your level cap by 30! Due to reaching the highest aptitude, it has been converted into 50 health points, 10 strength, and 10 defense.” 
Lin Tian was slightly stunned. Did this mean he unlocked the elf race and increased his level cap? 
But what was with the highest aptitude converting to attribute points? Normally, doing this kind of thing wouldn’t increase attributes. 
Without thinking much, his mind was elsewhere now. 
“Mother, what should Cassandra do? What is this?” 
Her cries for help mixed with the goblins’ sinister laughter, echoing endlessly! 
The once innocent elf girl, who would blush easily, was tortured beyond recognition after a few hours. 
Seeing that the time was almost up, Lin Tian locked her in a cage first, “We still need to attack the elf tribe. As for this elf, wait until tonight. Then you can all enjoy yourselves!” 
Although they were eager like wolves, remembering the attack on the elf tribe, they chose to hold back. 
Immediately, they readied the army and set out, leaving Gobu Yue to guard the camp. 
Cassandra lay weakly in the cage, crying alone. 
Gobu Yue felt a pang of compassion and brought her some water in a leaf. 
“Disgusting goblin! Get away! Don’t touch me, don’t touch me!” 
As soon as Gobu Yue approached, Cassandra went nearly insane, throwing the water away and curling up in the corner of the cage, trembling. 
Gobu Yue sighed, speaking gently, “Calm down, calm down. The boss is a good person; he’s different from other goblins. I’ll make sure he treats you well.” 
“I won’t believe a word from you goblins. Mother, brother, father, they will defeat all of you goblins and come to rescue me!” 
Cassandra said stubbornly, recalling her mother’s gentle smile in her mind. 
She felt so cold and just wanted to go home quickly. 
Seeing she couldn’t reason with her, Gobu Yue gave up and climbed up the tree to retrieve Cassandra’s stealth suit. “Put on your clothes first.” 
“You…” 
Cassandra was suddenly stunned, feeling that this goblin seemed somewhat different. 
But she said no more. 
She silently prayed. 
At this moment, the Myriad Forms Forest was silent, so oppressive it was almost suffocating. 
The sky was invisible due to the towering banyan trees blocking the view. 
Leading a large group of goblins, they silently infiltrated the forest. 
They carried daggers for easy stealth attacks. 
The mission had been clearly instructed: kill the male elves and paralyze the female elves with poison to bring them back. 
Looking at the treehouses, tens of meters high, Lin Tian couldn’t help but marvel at how well the elves lived. 
Without climbing skills, the chance of attacking successfully was zero! 
Moreover, the tree trunks had been coated with a special wax by the elves, making them extremely slippery, impossible to climb even for ghost-faced monkeys. 
With a hand signal, all the goblins began to climb. 
Using their skills and stabbing their daggers into the tree trunks for support, they easily and swiftly climbed up. 
Sneaking to the door of each wooden house, they waited for the right moment. 
Lin Tian climbed towards the highest wooden house, the residence of the Elf Matriarch. 
Using the “Silent Steps” skill of the tailless cat, even the sharpest elf ears couldn’t detect him. 
Through a crack in the door, he saw a voluptuous elf woman lying inside, fast asleep. 
Elf Matriarch: Lv30<br/>
Profession: Archer<br/>
Title: Mother of Elves, Endless Maternal Love<br/>
Health: 280<br/>
Strength: 43<br/>
Defense: 39<br/>
Skills: Keen Senses, Precise Eye, Archer’s Focus<br/>
Equipment: Short Sword<br/>
Overall: 370 
Her attributes were decent, but Lin Tian’s overall attributes had reached 400, so he wasn’t afraid. 
He quietly slipped in through the window, intending to pour some poison into her mouth, avoiding a fight. 
Unexpectedly, the Elf Matriarch was far more alert than he had imagined. 
“Who are you? Wait, a goblin? How did you get here?” 
She immediately drew her short sword and coldly questioned him. 
Seeing the situation exposed, Lin Tian shouted, “Attack!!!” 
“Ahhhh!” 
The goblins who had been lurking rushed into the wooden houses! 
They stabbed the male elves immediately upon sight! It was a chaotic frenzy with no chance to fight back! 
“Argh!” 
“What is this thing?” 
“No! Wife, run away!” 
Screams echoed throughout the Myriad Forms Forest, as chilling as the wails of ghosts in the dead of night!
