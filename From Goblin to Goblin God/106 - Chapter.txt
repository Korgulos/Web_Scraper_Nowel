Chapter 106: The Power of the Darkspawn 
TL: Sungmin 
“Steel Gale!” 
Terrifying, tangible sword energy slashed towards the cardinal. 
He was forced to retreat continuously, unable to counterattack. 
The deflected sword energy howled chaotically! 
In an instant, dozens of fully armored Imperial soldiers were shredded into pieces! 
A mist of blood filled the sky. 
Both sides of the fight instinctively paused, frantically retreating to a distance, not daring to approach. 
The cardinal knew in his heart that with the sword, he was no match for Alicenia. 
At this moment, his body was already covered in wounds. 
However, Alice’s attacks only grew fiercer! 
Cold sweat covered the cardinal’s forehead. “What a pity. If you could continue serving as the Sword Saintess, you might even surpass the Pope in the future!” 
So young, yet possessing such skill. 
One couldn’t help but feel both regret and awe. 
But now, no matter what, he had to take her down! 
Behind him, five tall Temple Guards approached slowly. 
They were stronger than the Holy Cross Guards, akin to squad leaders. 
Each had a power level of 6,000. 
There were only ten of them in the entire church. 
Clad in rusty, giant heavy armor, wielding cross-shaped broadswords, they exuded a stench of blood and bronze. 
They differed from monks and clerics. 
They bore no hint of sanctity, only deep, overwhelming killing intent. 
In a way, they were simply warriors. 
Similar to the warrior monks of Shaolin Temple. 
When words and reasoning failed, the Buddha would use a staff to enlighten you. 
The Temple Guards were no different. 
Behind them lay a trail of goblin corpses. 
Low-level goblins were crushed into pulp with a single stomp. 
“Your Excellency, the Holy Mother sent us to assist you,” the lead Temple Guard, Ferfis, said. 
His pupils, under the faceplate, glowed with a cold golden light. 
The cardinal finally caught his breath, warning, “Be careful, his sword contains the soul of a dragon and something else I can’t identify.” 
Ferfis nodded, raised his longsword, and attacked first! 
A leaping slash, dodged by Alice. 
“Boom!” 
The ground split into a ten-meter-long fissure! 
As Alice dodged, Temple Guards attacked from her left, right, and behind. 
They leaped high, swinging their swords down! 
Steel Gale slashed out, stirring up a cloud of dust! 
When the dust settled, the Temple Guards had vanished. 
Ferfis coldly asked, “Your Excellency, do we really have to keep her here forever?” 
Although they hadn’t interacted much with the Sword Saintess. 
They couldn’t bear to see her fall like this. 
“Do you see those soldiers’ corpses around? She did that. Do you really think she can be redeemed? You think I’m not heartbroken?” The cardinal shouted, emotionally agitated. 
He regretted it too, but now he was on the same path as Alice, a path of no return. 
Some mistakes could never be undone. 
“Ultimate Magic·Holy Force Field!!” 
Instantly, three golden magic circles condensed in the sky! 
Forming a hemispherical shield, trapping the seven of them inside. 
The range was small, only about ten meters, leaving almost no room to dodge. 
The cardinal held his holy sword, his expression uncharacteristically calm. “Alice, I’m sorry, let me end this sin today.” 
Ferfis and the others immediately attacked. 
In the confined space, Alice had nowhere to dodge, forced to take each attack head-on. 
She had to circle around, as being pinned against the force field would leave her helpless against multiple attackers. 
There was no way to block them all. 
Inside the force field, the clash of metal rang out. 
Sparks flew between blades! 
“Your Excellency, don’t harm Alice!” 
At this moment, Charles II noticed the situation and hurriedly shouted. 
Five Temple Guards had already come to support against Lin Tian and his group. 
A king must be protected first, or the army would collapse. 
The cardinal, hearing this, circled behind Alice, who was desperately fending off the attackers in front. 
He then delivered a heavy slash! 
Even tenth-tier armor cracked under the blow, splitting open. 
It cut through her white skin, blood oozing out. 
Charles II panicked, wildly striking the force field with his royal sword, only to be repelled by his own strength. 
“Stop it! Alice isn’t evil! She can still be saved!” 
His mission, besides destroying the goblins and the Great Tomb, 
Most importantly, was to save and retrieve Alice. 
However, now the Church wanted her dead. 
The cardinal said helplessly, “Your Majesty! She can no longer turn back, just like me! We can only see this mistake through to the end! I’m sorry!” 
“Men, break this force field!” 
Charles II, enraged, immediately ordered all nearby soldiers to change their target. 
But this Holy Force Field, an ultimate level control magic, couldn’t even be broken by its caster. 
On the contrary, the more attack power it absorbed, the stronger it became. 
Unless one could generate enough force to blow the field apart. 
But that was highly unlikely. 
Charles II could only watch helplessly again as Alice was forced to endure one brutal sword strike after another, her body drenched in blood! 
Her armor was shattered beyond recognition. 
Alice panted heavily; within this short time, she had blocked thousands of heavy sword blows. 
Her hands were bruised and swollen beyond recognition. 
Her arms ached to the point where she could barely lift them. 
Any slight mistake, and she would die here. 
“Lord God, is my mission to end here?” Alice thought unwillingly. 
She had yet to exterminate those demons in the royal city. 
Suddenly, that sinister, raspy voice sounded again, “Little girl, you seem very tired. Why don’t you rest for a bit and leave the rest to me?” 
“Shut up, I won’t be tempted by you!” Alice resisted. 
Seeing her resolve still so firm, the Darkspawn’s eyes gleamed, “You misunderstand. I mean to lend you power. After all, if you die, I will fall into the hands of the Church and never again savor the pleasure of blood.” 
Hearing this, Alice hesitated slightly because if she didn’t find a way, she would die here. 
Resolutely, she said, “Then, do it!” 
“Been waiting for you to say that!” 
At this moment, the cardinal and his men saw Alice half-kneeling, covered in blood, and felt slightly relieved. “Alice, farewell!” 
Ferfis closed his eyes, raising his heavy sword high, ready to deliver a beheading blow. 
To minimize her suffering, he would send off this highly respected Sword Saintess. 
Charles II screamed in agony, “Stop! Alice, my child!” 
“Whoosh!” 
However, as the heavy sword slashed down! 
“Bang!” 
To everyone’s surprise, the heavy sword was deflected by a terrifying force, piercing through the force field! 
Half-embedded in the protective shield above. 
The cardinal’s expression changed drastically. That aura was increasing rapidly! 
He quickly ordered, “Stay away from her!” 
The Sword Saintess’s broken armor began to melt, forming a new set of black armor that covered her body! 
Moreover, it seemed alive, with vein-like patterns running across it. 
Her sapphire blue eyes turned bloodshot crimson. 
From her right hand, holding the sword, blackened cracks spread up to her neck and half of her face. 
She looked as terrifying as a demon. 
A crimson aura of blood surrounded her, reeking of blood and fear. 
“This is… Darkspawn!” The cardinal’s heart finally confirmed it, and he hurriedly commanded, “We must kill her immediately! Don’t let her escape this force field!” 
Alice smirked disdainfully. 
In the next second, she frantically attacked the force field. 
With hundreds of soldiers attacking from outside, the force field soon shattered completely! 
Facing so many Imperial soldiers, Alice stretched out her hand and summoned a crimson, black hole-like object. 
The blood of those Imperial soldiers was drawn out. 
Completely drained! 
“This is bad!” 
“Ultimate Magic·” 
“Cough!” 
The cardinal hurriedly tried to cast another spell but coughed up a mouthful of blood, exhausted from casting two ultimate spells in succession. 
However, he gritted his teeth and continued, “Ultimate Magic·Holy Retribution!” 
In the sky, clouds parted. 
A massive golden sword slowly emerged, friction igniting it with fierce flames! 
It plummeted rapidly towards Alice! 
The giant sword had the oppressive presence of a mountain! 
Imperial soldiers and goblins alike fled in a panic! 
“Your Excellency, you!” 
Ferfis was shocked that he would use such a move. 
It was tantamount to annihilating everything within a three hundred-meter radius, sparing only those strong enough to survive. 
The cardinal understood the gravity of the situation. “It may be too late! Hold her down! We can’t let her fully transform into the Darkspawn. If she releases the Darkspawn, the whole world will be doomed!” 
Everyone restrained their attacks as much as possible; otherwise, no one around would survive. 
They had to be cautious of their own people. 
But now, the friendly casualties seemed insignificant compared to the threat. 
Alice continued absorbing blood frantically, her black and red blood armor becoming more lifelike. 
The veins on the armor pulsed like muscles. 
It looked like an exoskeleton. 
This was the Darkspawn’s body, its flesh. 
It wanted to rebuild its body, escaping Alice’s control, and be reborn through this grand war! 
“Enough, if you keep this up, I’ll kill you first, understand?” Alice’s voice was cold, issuing a threat. 
The Darkspawn replied in a sly tone, “Just a bit more, or we won’t be able to win. Almost there.” 
“I said, enough!” Alice shouted. 
Her aura surged! 
A terrifying burst of blood energy erupted, sending dozens of bodies flying. 
Thus, the Darkspawn could only comply reluctantly, “Alright, alright, that’s enough. But first, deal with the thing above us. Use my power.” 
“Ultimate Sword Skill·Abyssal Blood Sea!” 
Alice aimed her ominous blade at the oppressive giant sword above, activating four red magic circles. 
An illusion of a blood sea appeared. 
It devoured the giant sword entirely! 
The cardinal was shocked, “Impossible! Four magic circles?! Quick, attack her together and kill her!” 
Ferfis retrieved his sword, leading a charge with several Temple Guards! 
… 
TL: Yeah guys, just ignore the royal and imperial discrepancies that pop up sometimes. Sometimes characters that suggest an empire show up but don’t even when they should.
