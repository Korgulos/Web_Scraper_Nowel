Chapter 119: Katheryn’s Resolve 
TL: Sungmin 
“Too bad, did I allow you to speak? I hate people who like to act on their own!” 
Lin Tian forcefully pressed his sharp nails into her fair cheek! 
Blood trickled down along the nails. 
The woman wanted to scream in pain but dared not make a sound. 
She understood that if she cried out, those nails would sever her neck! 
Seeing that she acknowledged her mistake and considering her beauty, Lin Tian refrained from killing her.  
“Go back. You’d better all behave. If I take a dislike to anyone, I might just take action.” 
Everyone kept their heads down, not daring to look at him directly, trembling. 
They even breathed cautiously. 
“But don’t be afraid. I’m recognized as a good person in our circle, don’t you think?” Lin Tian continued his speech, looking back. 
Gobu Kuang and the others nodded vigorously, “Of course! He often helps lost girls find their way home! Although, it’s to his home… heh heh.” 
“The boss’s main thing is helping others. Look at her! The master of the Great Tomb, the undead renowned across the continent! Her wish was to live in the human world, and he brought her here.” 
“Not just that, the conflicts between monsters, the empire, and the church, which couldn’t be resolved for decades, our boss finished them all. Ahem, he finished the conflicts, don’t misunderstand.” 
Listening to the boasting of Gobu San and the others. 
None of the humans could muster a smile; instead, they were even more frightened. 
Lin Tian scolded, “If you can’t speak properly, say less, stop adding drama.” 
He then turned to the crowd, “As long as you cooperate with my arrangements, there’s no problem surviving. Your living conditions will be several times better than now.” 
Upon hearing this. 
Some were skeptical, some hopeful, and others remained utterly hopeless. 
They exchanged glances but only dared communicate with their eyes. 
“Believe it or not, but let me be clear, the condition is that each household needs to pay 70% of their future harvest as tax. I don’t want your money, and every woman must bear ten goblin offspring and raise them to adulthood. It’s that simple.” Lin Tian clarified, watching them. 
Seeing no one spoke, he added, “Oh, you can speak freely now, but don’t cause trouble.” 
Then. 
A desperate man spoke up, “Hmph, who are you fooling? Seventy percent of our food? That will starve us to death! It’s barely enough to feed a family!” 
In this era, seeds were different from modern ones. 
The yield and survival rates were much lower. 
The harvest was usually just enough for a family to survive a year. 
But since the kingdom imposed taxes, usually around 20%. 
It left families frequently having to scrimp and save to make it through the year. 
Not everyone in the capital was a wealthy merchant or landowner; many were laborers from elsewhere, aware of their family’s situation. 
So, they strongly rejected this demand. 
Seeing some dissatisfaction with this requirement. 
Lin Tian forced a smile, “Oh, you really want to argue?” 
He brought out the Spear of Zeus and summoned lightning again, “Boom!” 
Striking the man dead instantly! 
“You…” 
The residents fell into utter despair, even anger, ready to make a last desperate resistance. 
Lin Tian spoke again, “These people have poor hearing, survival of the fittest. I said, I will ensure you have enough to eat and wear, even with a seventy percent tax.” 
“But making us bear ten goblins? That’s absolutely impossible! Kill me if you want, but I won’t do it!” A girl stepped forward and said stubbornly. 
Lin Tian looked at this ‘girl,’ shrugged, “Alright then.” 
Then, he directly blasted her into ashes! 
However, many others began to resist. 
Indeed, they reached their breaking point; even death was preferable to giving birth to goblins and raising them. 
This was also why Alice was suppressed and hated for doing this. 
Seeing continuous killing wasn’t the solution. 
Lin Tian had to retreat to the back. 
The Holy Mother Katheryn slowly stepped forward, “Everyone~ I am the Holy Mother of the Church, Katheryn.” 
Her gentle voice, like a soothing spring rain, calmed the agitated hearts of the residents. 
Everyone became much calmer. 
“Giving birth to goblins, I know it’s unacceptable, but it will take at most two pregnancies, only two or three months, and goblins grow up in a month.” Katheryn continued. 
The crowd didn’t refute but looked very distressed. 
Katheryn kept persuading, “Everyone, if we do this, we can survive and even live better lives. Isn’t that good?” 
Gradually. 
Some people wavered. 
After all, the speaker was the Holy Mother, a maternal figure. 
Who could refuse her? 
However, some men were still reluctant to let their wives be humiliated, “Holy Mother, I’m sorry, but I still can’t agree!” 
Lin Tian frowned, ready to kill him. 
Katheryn stopped him, “It’s alright. Tell me, what would it take for you to accept?” 
“I… I don’t know.” 
The man was tearful and appeared extremely helpless. 
Likewise, many other men felt the same way. 
However, they didn’t dare say much to the Holy Mother, fearing they might disrespect her. 
Seeing the crowd in such a state. 
Katheryn took a deep breath and sighed in relief, “Everyone, I will also bear ten goblins as an example.” 
After speaking, she turned to Lin Tian. 
“Mr. Lin Tian, could you help me with this?” 
This left him a bit flustered, “Now, here?” 
He hadn’t yet found a suitable kidney for fusion. 
He couldn’t do it even if he wanted to. 
(Author’s Explanation: Some say the protagonist is useless. It’s not that he’s useless, but the author panicked. Earlier chapters were reported, so this setup is to give the protagonist a break. Constant high-speed action can be damaging, but rest assured, things will be okay later.) 
“Well, Holy Mother, we don’t need to rush to lead by example. How about tonight?” Lin Tian suggested. 
But Katheryn was resolute, “No, I must set an example. Only if everyone accepts the terms can we survive.” 
She began unbuttoning her clothes. 
“Enough, Holy Mother! We agree!” A man gritted his teeth, unable to bear it any longer. 
If he didn’t speak up, even his wife would agree first. 
Everyone was deeply moved and quickly agreed, “Holy Mother, you truly are a saint! We accept, please stop!” 
“Everyone… as long as we can survive, I’ll be content.” Katheryn looked at the crowd, feeling deeply gratified. 
However, she definitely intended to keep her word, so she would find Lin Tian later that night. 
The people were then allowed to return to their homes. 
They began repairing the damaged buildings. 
Lin Tian and the others entered the empire’s palace, feeling overwhelmed, “It’s truly luxurious. From now on, we’ll live here.” 
Looking at the magnificent architecture, he couldn’t help but remark, taking over really was satisfying! 
How long would it have taken to build it himself? 
“This place is much better than our previous damp and stinking tribe!” Gobu Kuang lay on the ground, stroking the cool marble floor. 
It felt like lying on ice. 
He was very content. 
Lin Tian also felt a bit of what real life was like. 
Even though he had become a goblin, it didn’t stop him from enjoying life. 
After struggling for nearly a year. 
Finally, he sat in the position he desired. 
Sitting slowly on the luxurious golden lion throne, he felt incredibly pleased. 
“Boss, Veronica has been imprisoned, and Rebecca is confined in a secret chamber awaiting childbirth.” 
At this moment, Gobu Jian approached respectfully. 
Lin Tian nodded, “Good. Did you follow my instructions? Make sure a few goblins take turns using the Demon Sealing Sword to continuously drain her magic. The goblins monitoring Rebecca must be castrated.” 
“Yes, as you instructed.” Gobu Jian responded. 
Only then did Lin Tian feel at ease. 
These two dangerous bombs had to be dealt with carefully, or the consequences would be unimaginable if they exploded. 
“Alright.” 
Lin Tian then began planning the empire’s development. 
He first designated areas for the goblins to live. 
Buildings within a few kilometers of the palace were exclusively for goblins; humans were not allowed near. 
Any incidents would be their own responsibility. 
As for food for the thousands of goblins, capturing livestock would suffice. 
Beef and mutton tasted delicious to goblins too. 
That night. 
Lin Tian organized a lively bonfire feast to reward his subordinates, offering thousands of cattle and sheep to eat freely. 
There were also young women for everyone’s entertainment. 
“Heh heh heh, isn’t Gobu Kuang happy about his evolution? Why isn’t he smiling now?” 
“Say that again, and he’ll start crying, haha!” 
Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan mocked while holding two fair-skinned beauties. 
Because. 
Gobu Kuang was now nearly five meters tall, completely mismatched with humans. In the future, he might have to seek monsters. 
Or perhaps the giant race. 
But for a long time, he could only watch others. 
“Woo woo woo, Boss! I want some too.” 
Finally, Gobu Kuang couldn’t hold back his tears and complained. 
Lin Tian sighed, “Get away from me. If you want some, don’t come to me. Can’t you bear it?” 
Bear it? 
How could he bear such a thing? 
Gobu Kuang now wanted to die, only able to watch others. 
Suddenly, Goblin Slayer had an idea, “If you evolve into a King variant, you might be able to shrink your body.” 
“Really?” 
Gobu Kuang, like a several-ton baby, wiped his tears and rejoiced. 
Goblin Slayer nodded, “As far as I know, King variants are about the same size as humans.” 
“Boss, I need to evolve quickly! Can you help?” Gobu Kuang clung to this hope. 
Lin Tian shook his head, “There are no monsters to eat now. In a few days, other empires will definitely come to attack us. Then you can devour and upgrade. Or wait until I develop the snow spirit farm.” 
Upon hearing this. 
Gobu Kuang could only turn his carnal desire into appetite, devouring roast beef and mutton. 
At that moment. 
Katheryn walked gracefully toward Lin Tian. 
In the dim firelight, her eyes were dreamy, with a faint pearly glow, extraordinarily charming. 
Her cheeks flushed as if she were a girl experiencing her first love. 
Which was actually true. 
The Holy Mother position required her to remain a pure maiden. 
“Mr. Lin Tian, could you help me now?”
