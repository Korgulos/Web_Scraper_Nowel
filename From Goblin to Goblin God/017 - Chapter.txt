Chapter 17: Rare Goblin 
TL: Sungmin 
“Mother, why are you talking to the goblin?” 
Cassandra’s eyes were full of unwillingness as she spoke. 
Lia still looked infatuated with Lin Tian. “Child, you don’t understand now, but you’ll see the good in Lin Tian later.” 
However, after speaking, a trace of helplessness flashed in her eyes. 
This was the only thing she could do now, to win Lin Tian’s sympathy and then fight for everyone’s freedom. 
That would provide an opportunity to escape. 
After several hours, Lin Tian finally finished. 
“Gobu Tian, Gobu Kuang, pry open that guy’s eyes for me.” 
Lin Tian looked at his results with a face full of pride as he spoke. 
Two goblins, taller by a head than ordinary goblins, immediately started to act upon hearing his words. 
They had to make him experience the utmost despair and pain. 
They were both Lin Tian’s direct descendants, with attributes far surpassing ordinary goblins and were on the verge of evolving into big variants. 
Thus, they planned to recruit younger brothers. 
In the goblin tribe, there were no father-son or mother-child relationships. They did not acknowledge a father but recognized a leader instead. 
If the leader ordered them to kill their biological parents or close friends, they would do so without hesitation. 
“Ah! Damn goblin, you beast! I will kill you! I will have the Imperial Knights flatten your tribe!!!” 
Seeing this scene, Loder roared, veins bulging on his forehead and neck. 
However, no matter how he struggled, it was useless. 
“Leader, leader, I’m fine. The Lord will bless us.” Ifreya struggled to speak. 
Her white nun’s habit was full of mud. 
Loder felt immense heartache. She was his childhood sweetheart, whom he had known since their time in the Holy Church. 
Now, she was in such a state. 
Lin Tian’s eyes were full of coldness and ruthlessness. The torture he had endured before was not any less than this. 
The key was that for Ifreya, the pain might be unbearable. 
But it was clear that for Loder, there was only endless torment and pain! Worse than death! 
Beside him, Loder shouted to stop, blood continually spurting from his throat, “Stop!!!” 
However, it was useless. 
He could only watch helplessly as the goblins took their revenge. 
At this moment. 
Gobu Kuang’s aptitude improved, and with sufficient level, he began to evolve. 
His body grew to about 1.7 meters. 
His slender limbs now bulged with muscles, clearly marking him as a ‘Goblin Warrior’ among the big variants.

Being a second-generation goblin, he would randomly inherit some skills. Besides, they had been hunting magical beasts and had long learned many skills. 
However, the most special was ‘Battle Roar,’ a unique skill of goblin warriors. 
The roar could deter other creatures, causing a brief loss of action ability, though it was ineffective against too strong creatures. 
Overall combat strength wasn’t purely based on attribute stacking. 
It was assessed based on combat performance. 
Seeing this attribute panel, Lin Tian was somewhat surprised. Second-generation goblins, indeed, evolved quickly and had such high attributes. 
They were almost catching up to him. 
“Gobu Tian, Gobu Kuang, take the other goblins and continue to kill magical beasts, devour more flesh to level up and evolve.” Lin Tian ordered. 
Now, as long as these second-generation goblins kept eating, they would gain experience and then break through level thirty to evolve into big variants. 
Building such a second-generation big variant goblin tribe would be enough to dominate this enchanted forest. 
According to recent investigations, their goblin tribe was not the only one in this enchanted forest. 
There were a total of seven. 
Except for the Bloodfang Tribe in the west, the others could be ignored. 
The leader of the Bloodfang Tribe was of big variant level and was about to evolve into a hero variant, with over three hundred members, posing some threat. 
So now, sending the tribe members to level up was the best option. 
“Yes, boss!” 
The goblins set off in mighty formation, already able to sweep from the south to the north. 
Then, Lin Tian looked at the dying Ifreya on the ground. 
He found a red potion bottle on her, probably a recovery potion. 
He wouldn’t let this guy die so quickly. 
“Why are you saving me, you demon!” Ifreya said painfully. 
But before she could finish speaking, she was tied up just like Loder to prevent her from escaping. 
At that moment. 
Loder began to panic, desperately trying to struggle and escape, but Gobu Yue kept injecting him with toxins, leaving him paralyzed all day. 
He understood now, it was his turn! 
“Jie jie, don’t get excited, take a deep breath, dizziness is normal.” 
Lin Tian took him down from the rock. 
He wandered around the forest for a while, then fiddled with the kiln. 
He made some simple torture devices. 
Doubling the torment he had previously suffered! 
“Seriously, you’re just a goblin, why is your heart so terrifying!” 
Loder looked at the rough and crude yet functional torture instruments, his pupils trembling! 
The word ‘fear’ instantly filled his brain! 
He hurriedly added, “Wait, this is not sanitary at all. What if it gets infected? Wait! Stop, stop! Ahhh!” 
As the tragic screams echoed, Loder experienced what it meant to be better off dead! 
He now personally understood how he used to torture monsters. 
… 
Several hours later, 
“Demons! A bunch of demons! Leader, hang in there, sob sob…” 
Ifreya cried her eyes out, not daring to look at Loder at this moment. 
Afraid that his shame would make him choose to bite his tongue and end his life. 
Loder, covered in blood and unsure if he was dead or alive, was thrown to the ground. 
Then tied up again, finally marking the end of the torment. 
The anger in Lin Tian’s heart had dissipated a lot. 
Now, he had to prepare to resist the human cleansing, though he wasn’t worried they would find this place so soon. 
“Boss, we’re back. The surrounding monsters have been killed, but fortunately, everyone has basically evolved into big variants!” 
At this moment, from a distance came the voices of Gobu Tian and the others. 
A group of strangely shaped goblins slowly approached. 
The reason they were called strange was that there were many branches of big variants, not just goblin warriors. 
Lin Tian’s eyes lit up, very satisfied! With this, they could go and crush the Bloodfang Tribe, capture their leader, and create the third generation of goblins. 
Third-generation goblins needed a goblin hero as a breeding stock to have a noticeable improvement. 
Although the Bloodfang Goblin was still a big variant, in Lin Tian’s hands, letting him evolve would be an easy task. 
Then, he counted the types of goblins that had evolved this time. 
Among them, there were 50 goblin warriors, with super high attack and defense attributes, but that was it, quite mediocre. 
Then 20 goblin assassins. 
Their bodies were about the same size as low-level goblins, only around 1.2 meters tall, but their skin had turned jet black, making it easier to hide. 
Their ears were sharper and longer, and their crimson eyes had become ghostly green. 
Moreover, Gobu Tian had also evolved into a goblin assassin. 
[Gobu Tian: Lv31<br/>
Race: Goblin<br/>
Profession: Assassin (Speed increased)<br/>
Title: Elf’s Child, God’s Blessing, Keen Hunter, Monster Slayer,…<br/>
Health: 300<br/>
Strength: 130<br/>
Defense: 80<br/>
Skills: Night Stealth, Deadly Ambush,…<br/>
Equipment: Simple Iron Armor, Simple Short Sword<br/>
Overall: 450] 
Although his attributes in various aspects were not as high as a goblin warrior, his overall strength was even higher than that of a goblin warrior. 
Because an assassin was far more troublesome than a warrior. 
Who knows, you might get stabbed to death walking at night. 
The rest included several goblin priests and one evil goblin. 
The role of goblin priests was to heal the group and such. 
But the evil goblin was something else. 
“Damn, if only I could become an evil goblin too. Unfortunately, I can’t evolve into a big variant, I can only ascend directly to a god.” Lin Tian said with a face full of unwillingness. 
Now, more than becoming a Goblin God, he wanted to be an evil goblin. 
[Evil Goblin: Lv30<br/>
Race: Goblin<br/>
Profession: None<br/>
Title: Elf’s Child, God’s Blessing, Monster Slayer, Strong Kidneys and Bones,…<br/>
Health: 200<br/>
Strength: 71<br/>
Defense: 44<br/>
Skills: **** , ****<br/>
Equipment: Simple Iron Armor, Simple Short Sword 
Overall: 150] 
Overall strength was pathetically weak. 
But the skills were really enviable. 
“You guys go back first, I’m going to have a little chat with this evil goblin in the forest.” Lin Tian said. 
Then he ordered the evil goblin to follow him into the dark enchanted forest. 
“Ah! Boss!” A miserable scream echoed. 
Startling the birds to scatter. 
“A one in a million chance! How could I pass it up?” 
In the forest, Lin Tian was devouring his flesh, one bite after another. 
He consumed it completely, gaining all the skills in the process. 
The possibility of a big variant mutating into an evil goblin was extremely small, so Lin Tian chose to kill him and seize his skills for himself.
