Chapter 197: When the One-Eyed Owl Wields Weapons 
TL: Sungmin 
“Is she crazy?!” 
Luna endured the excruciating pain as she struggled to her feet, surprised by how quickly she had broken through the encirclement. 
Fortunately, the Holy Tree’s branch spear could reassemble and restore itself. 
She immediately swung it, “World-class Magic · Sea of Leaves!” 
“Whoosh!” 
As the spear sliced through the air, a fierce hurricane arose, conjuring a flurry of rustling leaves! 
But each leaf was as sharp as a blade! 
The One-Eyed Owl stood within this sea of blades, her entire body cut open, blood seeping from numerous wounds! 
It was a horrifying sight! 
“Big Sis!” 
Osius and the others were alarmed at the scene, shocked that their opponent could wield world-class magic! 
Among the Holy Tree Warriors, aside from Luna, none had reached level 100, and none could use world-class magic. 
The One-Eyed Owl spoke up, “Don’t come closer, I can handle this! It’s been so long since I last used this ability!” 
As she spoke, she removed her eyepatch. 
That eye, shimmering like a crystal, was not a prosthetic—it was her original eye! 
Under her long, captivating eyelashes, her eye glowed with the brilliance of a multicolored gem! 
“Magic · Crystal Skin!” 
“Crack, crack, crack…” 
Instantly. 
A powerful light burst from her eye, covering her body in a layer of crystal, making her appear as though she had transformed into crystal itself! 
This was the ability she had gained from her battle with the Crystal Dragon—a blessing in disguise. 
Her eye had been gouged out, but the Crystal Dragon’s blood on its claws, combined with the crystalline structure, caused a mutation. 
It had turned into a magic artifact. 
That’s right—the One-Eyed Owl’s left eye was now equivalent to a magical tool. 
With the Crystal Dragon’s super-strong defense. 
She could now move freely within the Sea of Leaves! 
She charged directly at Luna, aiming a brutal punch at her abdomen! 
“Ah!” 
In an instant. 
Luna felt like her intestines were about to explode, spitting out saliva as her eyes bulged! 
The perverse strength was simply on a different level! 
She quickly swung her spear again to counterattack. 
But the One-Eyed Owl grabbed the spear and snapped it in half, tossing it aside, “Hmph, I told you, close combat is more satisfying!” 
“Bang! Bang! Bang!” 
She landed several more punches on the spot. 
Her maniacal laughter echoed around them, chilling to the bone! 
Luna was beaten to the ground, curled up with sticky saliva dripping from her mouth, her pupils trembling violently! 
Clutching her abdomen, she was in unbearable pain! 
There was no trace of her former commanding presence, only a pitiful sight. 
“My stomach, you! You maniac! It hurts, it hurts so much!!!” 
Luna trembled as she spoke, touching her pants. 
They were soaked with blood! 
Her intestines and organs had been brutally ruptured, blood and flesh spilling out in a gruesome mess! 
“Luna!” 
Seeing this, the Tree Spirit anxiously called out, activating her ability, “Holy Tree Magic · Healing Flower Cage!” 
A magic circle formed beneath Luna. 
A massive yellow-white flower bloomed, encasing her and forcefully repelling the One-Eyed Owl. 
Immediately afterward, a huge vine descended! 
This time, it struck with full force! 
The One-Eyed Owl struggled to withstand the vine’s power, her legs trembling slightly, and the ground beneath her feet caved in, “Damn it, this seems to be the thickest vine?! It’s indeed heavy…” 
“Revenge for Luna!” 
“This is our chance, everyone ignore the others, take down the One-Eyed Owl!” 
“Kill her, and we can claim victory!” 
In an instant. 
Seven or eight Holy Tree Warriors turned and charged at the One-Eyed Owl! 
Osius and the others felt their hearts tighten, “Not good!” 
Everyone immediately followed suit. 
But the vine suddenly slammed down, blocking their path. 
A towering wall, dozens of meters high, appeared before them, impossible to scale. 
Breaking through was out of the question. 
This was the root system of the World Tree, spread across the world, not just any ordinary tree root. 
“Kill!” 
Immediately, the Holy Tree Warriors brandished their spears and viciously stabbed at the One-Eyed Owl. 
“Thwack!” 
Even with her extraordinarily delicate footwork avoiding most of the attacks, one spear still pierced through her ribcage. 
In that moment, the One-Eyed Owl roared like an enraged lioness, using all her strength to lift the vine! 
“What! Impossible! How much strength does this woman have!” 
The next second. 
The One-Eyed Owl forcefully yanked out the spear, snapping it and discarding it, “You all… are going to die!” 
Her terrifying aura, like a lion’s roar, intimidated everyone. 
They hesitated, too scared to advance. 
At this moment, Luna had almost fully recovered, the healing flower blooming, “The one who should die is you! Tree Spirit, you just need to hold off the others; we’ll focus on killing this woman first!” 
“Understood, Sister Luna!” 
Osius and the others found themselves blocked by four or five thick tree vines, making it impossible to get close. 
The walls these vines formed reached hundreds of meters high, and they were constantly moving. Any attempt to climb over resulted in being swatted away. 
The remaining vines were focused on restraining the Black Goblin. 
Meanwhile, the One-Eyed Owl had to face a formidable opponent with a battle strength of 12,000, along with seven or eight others with strengths over 9,000. 
“You lunatic! You seemed to enjoy yourself earlier, but don’t blame us now!” Luna commanded with a shout. 
All the Holy Tree Warriors focused their attacks on her! 
Even a great warrior couldn’t fend off so many attacks at once. 
Although the One-Eyed Owl could suppress one opponent, she couldn’t defend against attacks from behind. 
In just a few moments, her crystal armor shattered completely. 
Luna smiled in satisfaction, “Keep going! We’re close to finishing her off!” 
“Bang!” 
At that moment, the One-Eyed Owl landed a punch square on Luna’s face, knocking out several teeth. “You should worry about yourself first!” 
Luna was sent flying but wasn’t seriously harmed. “Hmph, where’s your strength now? Weren’t your punches much stronger earlier? Seems like you’re starting to lose your power!” 
The One-Eyed Owl didn’t respond. 
Indeed, she couldn’t fully concentrate on her punches anymore, having to hold back some strength to avoid overcommitting and leaving herself vulnerable to attacks. 
She had to balance offense and defense, which naturally weakened her attacks. 
“Bang! Bang! Bang!” 
Even so, the group of Holy Tree Warriors was left bruised and dizzy from her blows. 
Luna, enduring the pain, sneered, “How much longer can you keep this up? At this rate, you’ll be dead soon! Hmph!” 
Although they had taken some hits. 
They had also managed to wound the One-Eyed Owl—her thigh, abdomen, and back were all pierced with bleeding holes. 
“Is that so? Then I’ll just focus on killing one of you first!” 
The One-Eyed Owl suddenly accelerated, pouncing like a lion and pinning down one of the warriors, delivering several heavy punches to his head! 
Bones cracked as his face caved in! 
One more punch and his skull would have been completely crushed. 
“Thwack!” 
Unfortunately, three spears stabbed into her back, blood gushing out! 
Her flesh tore open, exposing the raw, gruesome wounds! 
The One-Eyed Owl, gritting her teeth through the pain, was about to finish off the man she had pinned, but in that brief moment, he managed to escape. 
“This woman is damn hard to kill! She’s lost so much blood already, why isn’t she dead yet?” 
“She’s a demigod descendant, of course she’s harder to kill, but it’s only a matter of time!” 
“Didn’t we say earlier? When the time comes, we’ll take our time, and have some real fun with that woman who’s always with the Goblin!” 
“Exactly, that’ll be our revenge for the Tree Spirit, right?” 
“Hahaha!” 
The Holy Tree Warriors sneered, their faces twisted with lecherous smiles. 
Even Luna added, “You all know the plan—when the time comes, show no mercy, and make sure to leave her barely alive!” 
The Tree Spirit had been violated by the goblin. 
She couldn’t swallow that humiliation. 
Now, having a chance for revenge was the best she could hope for. 
The One-Eyed Owl, breathing heavily, realized she had no way out, but she couldn’t help but laugh, “Hahaha! I never expected people from the Holy Tree Empire to be so despicable. Seems goblins aren’t so evil after all.” 
Before, she had always been a bit wary of Lin Tian. 
But now, it seemed like every race was the same. 
Her mind was suddenly at ease. 
She slowly reached toward her waist, taking out a pair of tenth-tier magical gauntlets. 
After putting them on, she flexed her fingers. 
They fit perfectly, her fists feeling even stronger. 
In that moment. 
Her battle strength, originally 12,000, surged to 15,000!! 
The difference between bare hands and weapons was stark. 
Luna scoffed, “Still thinking of resisting? Why not just lie down and enjoy yourself before you die.” 
“Is that so…” 
The One-Eyed Owl’s headband snapped, her long hair cascading down. 
Her aura exploded! 
With her hair loose, she looked even more like a mighty lion! 
Immediately. 
One of the Holy Tree Warriors charged at her, ready to deliver a killing blow, “Ultimate Combat Skill · Death Thrust!” 
The spear in his hand shot forward like a venomous snake! 
The One-Eyed Owl stood still, aiming her fist at the spearhead! 
“Crack!” 
The spear shattered from the tip to the hilt, turning into dust! 
“Bang!” 
Her fist grazed the warrior’s face. 
Luna and the others’ expressions changed. They didn’t know what had happened, but the man suddenly stood motionless, as if turned to stone. 
From a different angle, they saw it. 
They were horrified to the point of breathlessness! 
Half of his face had been pulverized, along with part of his skull! 
He collapsed to the ground, blood gushing from the gaping hole in his face. His legs twitched a few times, then he died on the spot. 
The One-Eyed Owl, feeling the unparalleled impact of her blows, grew even more excited! 
Before, she would never have dared to clash with someone else’s weapon barehanded! 
This sensation of piercing through and killing with a single strike was almost intoxicating. 
“This feeling! This is exactly what I wanted! It feels amazing! Lin Tian, I love you so much! I never imagined using gauntlets would feel like this!!! Hahaha!” 
Standing over the corpse, the One-Eyed Owl burst into maniacal laughter. 
Her laughter struck fear into Luna and her comrades, making their hearts race. Killing someone and laughing so madly about it—she seemed completely unhinged! 
She was more like a crazed addict in the throes of a high! 
Luna grew cautious, “Everyone, attack together! No mercy, aim for her weak points!” 
With that command, she swung her spear again, now able to use her magic, “Sea of Leaves!!” 
This time, the leaves were even more numerous and fierce! 
The range was wider. 
And it wouldn’t harm the Holy Tree Warriors, shredding everything else inside to pieces! 
But the One-Eyed Owl ignored the wounds the leaves inflicted on her skin. 
She charged straight at them! 
“Bang!” 
In an instant, blood splattered through the sea of leaves! 
With one punch, she exploded someone’s head! 
The copious blood sprayed out, swirling through the leaves like a crimson sea! 
At that moment. 
Another spear thrust at her. 
The One-Eyed Owl didn’t bother dodging; she simply crushed the spearhead with her hand, then countered with an uppercut aimed at the man’s groin! 
“Crack!” 
A brutal blow! 
“Ahhhh! Help me, Tree Spirit!!! It hurts so much!!!” 
The Holy Tree Warrior instantly lost all will to fight, collapsing to the ground, clutching his now-mangled groin, eyes bulging in agony! 
In desperation, he stabbed the spear shaft into his own head, committing suicide on the spot! 
It’s said that the pain of such a blow is equivalent to breaking several thousand ribs at once, or giving birth to 160 children simultaneously! 
Living would be a thousand times more painful than death. 
The One-Eyed Owl, grinning, was drenched in blood but seemed utterly unfazed by the pain! 
Whoever she struck was torn apart! 
“Come on! Come on!” 
Before long, all the Holy Tree Warriors lay dead, yet the One-Eyed Owl still wasn’t satisfied! 
Her black iron gauntlets were now stained a deep red, as was she. 
On the ground. 
Several mutilated corpses lay scattered. 
Some had their ribcages burst open from the chest, with bones protruding through their backs. 
Others were missing entire halves of their bodies. 
And a few had their heads crushed by a single punch—surviving such a blow was impossible. 
Luna stood trembling behind her, “You—you demon! Madwoman! Aren’t you afraid of pain?!” 
The ground was scarred with deep, ten-centimeter gouges. 
Yet the One-Eyed Owl stood tall, protected by the blood of the Holy Tree Warriors, which made the leaves’ attacks ineffective. 
If she had focused on defense from the beginning instead of fighting, she might have already died in the Sea of Leaves. 
Luckily, the blood from the man whose head exploded had spread throughout the Sea of Leaves. 
“Pain? What’s that? I’m having the time of my life right now!!!” 
With that, the One-Eyed Owl lunged at Luna, aiming another punch at her abdomen! 
“Ah!” 
In an instant. 
Luna dropped to her knees in agony, just like before, vomiting clear fluid, her eyes nearly popping out of her head! 
Earlier, she had been struck several times. 
This time, a single punch had turned her abdomen into a bloody mess! She couldn’t even muster a counterattack! 
Her internal organs were completely mangled! 
The fact that she hadn’t passed out from the pain was a testament to her strong will.
