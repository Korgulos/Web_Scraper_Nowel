Chapter 211: Agony Beyond Words, a Strike from a Little Girl 
TL: Sungmin  
“Delicious! So delicious!” 
“Don’t you dare snatch it from me!! I’ll kill anyone who dares!!” 
“Get lost! Get lost!” 
In the chaos of the crowd fighting for food, Joan was shoved aside. She had to leap onto the city wall just to find a place to stand. 
In just ten minutes. 
Not even the leaves or grass were left, and the five meat horses had been devoured completely! 
There wasn’t even a trace of blood left on the ground. 
Even the wagon clips and burlap shelters had been eaten clean! 
It was a terrifying sight. 
And yet, it wasn’t nearly enough for over two million people. 
After the first group finished gorging themselves. 
Another group of cunning individuals waited nearby, their eyes dangerous and terrifying like monsters, staring hungrily at those who had eaten their fill. 
They licked their lips with frenzy. 
Because those people would be their next meal. 
Sure enough. 
After consuming a massive amount of leaves and grass, many began writhing in pain on the ground, unable to bear the agony! Sweat as large as beans dotted their foreheads. 
“Ahh, my stomach, someone help me!” 
“My stomach’s going to explode, what’s happening?!” 
“Your Highness Joan, anyone, please help me, I can’t take it anymore!” 
After an hour of continuous screams. 
One by one, people began fainting or passing out. 
In an instant! 
The cunning group waiting to feast on flesh rushed forward like ravenous wolves, tearing and devouring their victims alive! 
The sound of chewing flesh was chilling, like the whispers of demons! 
Joan stood on the city wall, trembling uncontrollably as she watched. Her heart felt as if someone was stabbing it repeatedly with a knife! 
“It’s all changed, everything has changed. How did it come to this? Is the Free Empire still a place fit for human survival?” 
The citizens before her. 
They were more terrifying than monsters. 
Yet despite all this, there were still many who hadn’t eaten. 
Especially those previously imprisoned in the War Empire. 
They regretted everything! 
“I want to go back to the War Empire, I want to be ruled by the goblins again!” 
“Why did you save me?! I was perfectly fine there!” 
“Damn it! Damn it all! I’d rather breed goblins than stay in this hellhole!” 
A group of people stared at Joan on the city wall with venomous hatred. 
She averted her gaze, unable to meet their eyes, but her heart was filled with frustration! 
She had saved them, and now they were blaming her. 
But this disaster was indeed her doing, and she had no face to argue back. 
In the end. 
She helplessly looked at everyone and said, “Rest assured, we will get through this! If we all work together, we can rebuild and, after that, we’ll destroy the goblins and live an even better life!” 
However, the residents did not believe her words at all. 
Talking about grand futures at a time like this—people were starving to death! 
“Your Highness, forget about defeating goblins, just surviving is already a problem! How are we supposed to get through this?!” 
“I’m so hungry, if a goblin gave me food right now, I’d rather be ruled by them!” 
“We’re all doomed, we’re all going to die!” 
“Your Highness, take a look behind you, at those bones. Maybe the next one will be you, or maybe it’ll be me…” 
At that. 
Joan turned around and saw the snow-white bones scattered all over the city! 
The sight nearly suffocated her. 
Though she had been through countless battles and wasn’t afraid of such things, it was the fact that her own failure had caused this. 
Joan’s face turned grim as she tried to say something more. 
Suddenly. 
From the distance, a vast goblin army was charging toward them! Their ranks seemed endless, and their imposing presence was overwhelming! 
The residents were terrified and scattered in all directions. In their current state, they had no strength to resist the goblins. 
However, the refugees from the War Empire remained where they were. 
They knelt on the ground, bowing and kowtowing! 
Joan’s face grew even darker, but she had no choice but to draw the Sacred Sword of Faith, ready to fight. “I knew you evil goblins would come…” 
But at first glance. 
The Sacred Sword of Faith had already dimmed and rusted, having lost its former power. 
In such circumstances, who would still believe in her? They’d rather worship the god of food. 
“It’s been a while, Your Highness Joan! Here I am!” 
Lin Tian rode atop Little Black, descending like a demon king, his presence overwhelming! 
Below him, a hundred thousand goblins were enough to fill the field! 
There were also many demi-human monsters from Goblin City, all gathered for one reason: to witness Lin Tian defeat Joan. 
They wanted to see this legendary event unfold. 
As Lin Tian gazed at the desolate and miserable Free City. 
He couldn’t help but laugh. “Your Highness Joan, it seems like you’ve been having a rough time lately. The so-called greatest Free Empire isn’t even as good as my pigsty, hahahaha!” 
“What is it you want?!” 
Joan gathered all her strength and raised her voice, attempting to assert her dominance. 
But with no food to eat, where could she find the energy? 
“What am I here for? Obviously, for revenge. Have you forgotten that we declared war on each other? Are you scared?” Lin Tian sneered. 
Joan’s eyes were filled with disdain. “Afraid of you? I’ve never been afraid of anyone! Especially not an ugly, low-level goblin like you! Hmph, you’ll never rise above me!” 
At these words. 
Lin Tian’s eyes narrowed, full of killing intent. 
At this moment, the refugees from the War Empire began kowtowing fervently. 
“Your Goblin Majesty, we were wrong. Please, take us back!” 
“We’re willing to breed goblins for you, voluntarily! As long as you give us food and let us survive!” 
“This place is real hell! Being ruled by Your Goblin Majesty is my greatest wish!” 
“Please, we beg you!” 
Seeing these people, Lin Tian raised an eyebrow. “Oh? Still alive, are you? Didn’t I tell you before that you’d regret this?” 
“We know we were wrong, Your Majesty! This place is hell! My child, my friends—they all disappeared for no reason, or perhaps were…” A woman wept as she spoke. 
Lin Tian laughed mockingly, “Is that so? Well, that’s wonderful. They’ve gone to heaven, haven’t they? You should be happy.” 
“Don’t push it too far! If you want a fight, let’s have a one-on-one duel. Do you dare?!” Joan raised the rusted Sacred Sword, her voice cold. 
But Lin Tian didn’t respond. 
A duel? That wasn’t why he was here. 
He was here to savor Joan’s slow, painful death. 
Below, Gobu Kuang sneered, “Hmph, you lot still want food? Go eat shit! Useless fools, given a chance, but still good for nothing!” 
Hearing this. 
Lin Tian furrowed his brow. “Hiss! Wait… didn’t your ‘queen’ tell you how to survive?” 
The residents looked confused. 
They didn’t understand what he was talking about. 
Joan’s eyes trembled, a deep fear welling inside her. She was terrified! 
Because Lin Tian had told her that if she offered her body, food would be given. 
If she sacrificed her life. 
It would ensure the survival of the people. 
But she didn’t want to die. She wanted to live, to stay alive and create value, to save even more people. 
In truth, she had never been a saint, only someone who enjoyed being surrounded and worshipped. 
The feeling of being revered as a symbol of faith. 
That’s why she foolishly decided to rescue the refugees from the War Empire. 
“You’re trying to stir up conflict between us! Some see me as a mother, others as a daughter. They would never…” Joan began. 
Suddenly, a voice from the crowd interrupted her. 
“What?! We… we can survive?!” 
“If that’s the case, and we can get food, then why not have Joan sacrifice herself? It’s not that big a deal anyway!” 
“Exactly! Didn’t she claim she was here to save us? How could she keep such a thing from us? That’s despicable!” 
“I thought she was like a goddess, but now I see she’s just a coward! A disgrace!” 
The eyes that once gazed upon her with reverence now brimmed with hatred! 
Joan felt as though a knife had been thrust into her heart. “Soldiers! You… why are you doing this to me? I freed you from slavery, taught you how to fight, gave you freedom and strength!!!” 
In the crowd. 
The soldiers who had once fought alongside her couldn’t bring themselves to meet her eyes. 
Because they were the ones who had revealed this secret. 
“Your Highness Joan! Why are you just standing there? Are you really going to watch us die?!” 
“Sacrificing your body won’t kill you, so just do it already!” 
“You hypocrite! I see you clearly now, Davens Joan! You’re nothing but a false god!” 
Voices of venomous curses echoed! 
Countless fingers were pointed at her, accusing her with relentless fury! 
Joan’s legs weakened, and she stumbled back several steps, nearly falling from the city wall. She shook her head in disbelief, despair, and pain. The overwhelming negative emotions were consuming her! 
Unable to hold back, she shouted in desperation, “What are you all saying?! I fought with my own blood to free you! I gave you homes, identities, and new lives! 
Why?! Why should I be the one to sacrifice?! It should be you! You’re the despicable ones, all of you!” 
She no longer resembled the heroic and noble figure from before. 
Now, she looked more like a common woman quarreling in the streets. 
Her voice was hoarse as she screamed. 
“False god! False god! False god!!!” 
The entire Free City echoed with those two words! 
Like thunder, they boomed from all sides, crashing down upon Joan. 
Hundreds of thousands, even millions, of fingers pointed at her like sharp blades! 
Pressing closer with every step! 
The suffocating pressure! 
Joan’s pupils trembled, and the Sacred Sword in her hand fell to the ground. 
She was on the verge of collapse! 
She had fought so hard to give them a better life, and now these same people were pushing her toward death! 
Suddenly. 
Lost in thought. 
Joan felt an excruciating pain in her back and swiftly turned around. 
She saw the little girl she had rescued from the War Empire not long ago. 
The girl now looked like a devil—gaunt and terrifying, grinning maliciously. “Sister, can you please die for me? I’m still young, I don’t want to die… I just want to eat.” 
In the little girl’s hand. 
Was the Sacred Sword that had fallen, and she had plunged it viciously into the gap in Joan’s light armor, piercing her body. 
Though the wound wasn’t deep. 
To Joan, it felt more painful than a stab to the heart! 
“So, have you decided to sacrifice yourself yet, my dear Majesty Joan of Arc? Keh keh keh…” Lin Tian laughed darkly. 
This was the moment he had been waiting for—the moment she would be in agony beyond words.
