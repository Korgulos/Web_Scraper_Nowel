Chapter 137: Infiltrating the Dragon Slayer Guild! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Alice, I thought so highly of you. I believed your character was noble and pure, but to think you would do this!” Edward gritted his teeth in anger. 
He had lost, and everything was slipping away! 
However, Alice did not say much and continued to attack earnestly. 
But all her attacks were blocked by him. 
In terms of swordsmanship, Alice was three points/percent inferior to Edward. 
At this moment, Lin Tian responded, “It’s not her fault. I called these goblin armies. You did offer a duel, but I never accepted it.” 
“You!” 
Edward didn’t know what to say for a moment. At first, he saw only Lin Tian and a few others, thinking they would duel. 
He had truly underestimated the goblins’ despicableness! 
“Hmph, don’t be too proud. They lost this battle badly, but I am the biggest winner!! I will return for revenge!” 
Edward forced Alice back with a sword strike and turned to charge into the river. 
Utilizing Sylph’s wind element, he treaded the waves and escaped to the other side. 
He changed the wind direction, making it impossible for Lin Tian and his group to pursue due to the fierce hurricane. 
Soon, he disappeared from sight. 
Alice steadied herself and apologized, “Messenger, I let him escape. I’m sorry.” 
“It’s fine. It’s already very impressive that you managed to hold him off for so long,” Lin Tian said gravely. 
Edward’s combat power was over 9,000, while Alice’s was 8,900, not yet reaching 9,000. 
However, Edward had indeed profited greatly this time. 
He could annex two magic kingdoms without losing a single soldier, easily expanding his army by a million! 
And now, they were inexplicably targeted by the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Suddenly, they had too many enemies, making things difficult. 
The key issue was that the system was still under maintenance, preventing any life simulation to foresee the plot’s direction. 
“Let’s go. What’s wrong?” Lin Tian asked, looking at the dazed Alice. 
“Nothing, I was reflecting on Edward’s swordsmanship. As expected of the Sword Saint, I couldn’t find any flaws and was continuously suppressed,” Alice said, somewhat embarrassed. 
However, the Darkspawn within the Ominous Blade was displeased, “Hahaha! This is the funniest thing I’ve heard. His swordsmanship deserves to be called Sword Saint? Are the swordsmen of later generations so pathetic?” 
“Next time, you should let me take over. I’ll show you what real swordsmanship is!” the Darkspawn continued, full of disdain. 
Lin Tian’s eyes lit up, thinking of something. “Alice, I’ll leave the attack on the Sword Kingdom to you. I need to personally check out the Dragon Slayer Guild.” 
“What? I lead the troops?” Alice was surprised, not expecting a large-scale battle. 
Lin Tian, however, had complete trust, “Didn’t that Darkspawn just say? Leave it to him. I also trust you. The Dragon Slayer Guild is very important to me.” 
First, he needed to probe and gather enough intelligence on these inexplicably powerful individuals. 
Second, the Flame Dragon Mother required the dragon crystal for resurrection, and it just so happened that the guild had it. 
Moreover, he couldn’t handle everything by himself. Not only would it be exhausting, but it would also slow down progress. 
“Kekekeke, Goblin, I have high regard for you. If one day I regain my physical body, you can become my first general and we will bathe this continent in blood. How about it?” the Darkspawn said happily. 
Lin Tian shrugged, “Alright, thanks in advance.” 
Returning to the capital. 
The goblins and humans on the streets welcomed them as usual. 
Lin Tian did not disperse the crowd but called another meeting, “During this time, follow Princess Alice to attack the Sword Kingdom. If they annex the Magic Kingdom, they will be hard to deal with. We must strike first.” 
“What about you?” Gobu Yue asked in confusion. 
“I’ll go to the Dragon Slayer Guild and see if I can retrieve the dragon crystal,” Lin Tian explained. 
It was best not to hide anything among themselves. 
After all, many were genuinely worried about him. 
Fiona found it hard to believe, “You’re going to infiltrate the Dragon Slayer Guild? Are you crazy?” 
The Dragon Slayer Guild was even more infamous in the monster world than in human society. 
After all, they had nothing else to do but hunt powerful monsters daily. 
The One-Eyed Owl among them was a monstrously powerful existence. 
She didn’t want their hard-won home to be destroyed. 
“It’s a necessary risk, but I have my plans. You can trust me,” Lin Tian said. 
His Abnormal Fusion had its uses. 
Moreover, he could also visit the Dwarf Kingdom, where many of his offspring had likely been born. 
Who knew what might happen? 
After understanding the situation, everyone began preparing for battle under Alice’s orders. 
Lin Tian rested for a while before heading to the dungeon to find Rebecca. 
,, 
“Darling! Where are you! Darling! I can’t bear to be without you! I feel like I’m dying!” 
From a distance, he could already hear Rebecca’s alluring and seductive voice. 
She sounded extremely excited. 
As he pushed open the door, the room was filled with a unique fragrance. 
There was also some strange moisture on the ground. 
It was one of the succubus’ abilities. 
It could keep a male in a constant state of readiness, never tiring. 
Who would have thought that this creature’s love for him had reached such a level? 
“Darling! Untie me, I want it!” 
Rebecca struggled against the chains, appearing very frantic. 
It scared Lin Tian, making him think she might bite him. 
He then asked, “Calm down first. Is there any additional information about the child I left in your body? Like how you felt when you were pregnant and how it felt to look at him.” 
“I can’t remember. Now my mind is filled only with you! I need you! I want to merge with you completely, never to be separated!” 
Rebecca squirmed and spoke louder and louder, her breath becoming heated. 
Lin Tian slapped her hard across the face, “Can you sober up a bit? If you love me, then honestly tell me more about that child.” 
With the crisp sound of the slap. 
He thought Rebecca might calm down. 
Instead, after a few seconds of silence, she became even more agitated, not feeling the pain at all. 
“Damn it, do you have no other thoughts besides love?” 
Helpless, Lin Tian could only step back, lock the door securely. 
He decided to let her cool off first. 
However. 
Veronica on the other side heard everything clearly, “Damn goblin, what have you done to my Rebecca!” 
Filled with hatred, but she could do nothing. 
“Behave yourself, Rebecca is one of us now.” 
Gobu Jian said coldly beside her, staying alert in case she caused any trouble. 
… 
Oh wait, forgot to mention it, but Gobu Jian’s Jian means sword.
