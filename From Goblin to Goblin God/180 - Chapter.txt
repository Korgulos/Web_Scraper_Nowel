Chapter 180: The Three Tyrants of the City, Gobu Kuang, Gobu Tian, Gobu Shan!! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Katheryn, how long will it take to set up a large teleportation array?” Lin Tian asked. 
To deal with this city, they first needed to establish a large teleportation array connected to the main city to facilitate movement. 
Moreover, it wasn’t feasible to keep exhausting Katheryn by making her teleport so many soldiers. 
The Infinite Holy Grail was also nearly depleted, and it would take several days and nights to fully recharge. 
However, even the War Empire didn’t have the capability to construct a large teleportation array. 
Katheryn appeared somewhat troubled. “Goblin Majesty, I can arrange it, but maintaining a large teleportation array requires a significant amount of legendary magic crystals…” 
Lin Tian had heard of legendary magic crystals before. Generally, they were obtained by defeating Demon Kings or slaying powerful monsters, extracting them from their bodies. 
Alternatively, one might be incredibly lucky to discover a magic crystal mine. 
They were somewhat akin to energy sources, similar to electricity or gas. 
But they were extremely rare. 
“That’s easy to handle. Let’s set up a few small teleportation arrays first. I’ll take care of the magic crystal problem later.” Lin Tian said. 
He didn’t have any legendary magic crystals, but substitutes could work just as well. 
He could bring a portion of the Yeti Tribe over, create an extremely cold environment, summon Snow Spirits, and produce magic crystals in large quantities. 
The effect might even surpass that of legendary magic crystals. 
Katheryn nodded and, after eating and drinking her fill, got busy. 
Then Lin Tian looked at everyone. “I’m heading back to the main city now. Are you planning to come along, or would you prefer to stay here until the large teleportation array is established?” 
“I’ll go take a look first. I’m curious to see what this unprecedented Goblin Empire is like!” Master Bill said with interest. 
Everyone else felt the same. 
The remaining dwarves, dragons, and goblins stayed behind to guard the city. 
As they stood in the teleportation array, brilliant light shot skyward, dazzling and radiant! 
In no time at all. 
The group arrived at the Goblin Empire’s plaza. 
Lia, Gobu Yue, Goblin Slayer, and others were already there, waiting vigilantly. 
Seeing so many strange and unfamiliar people, Gobu Yue grew wary. “Boss, are you okay? Are they friends or foes!?” 
Lia also readied her Hunting Longbow. 
They couldn’t rule out the possibility that Lin Tian had been taken hostage. 
“Well, well, you’ve got a golden house hidden away, huh? These two are both stunning!” 
The One-Eyed Owl smirked wickedly, eyeing Lia and Goblin Slayer. 
Gobu Yue was still wearing a tattered cloak, with only a pair of golden eyes visible. 
Her appearance was indiscernible. 
As the One-Eyed Owl approached with an arrogant and cocky expression, Lia let her guard slip, and the string of her Hunting Longbow loosened. An arrow whistled through the air, piercing the sky! 
The One-Eyed Owl, filled with disdain, prepared to dodge. But even though she evaded, the arrow turned mid-air! 
It lodged itself into her forearm. 
“Hiss! What kind of cursed bow is this?! The arrow can actually track me?” 
The One-Eyed Owl cursed, surprised as she pulled the bloody arrow out. 
Master Bill chuckled nearby. “That’s the Hunting Longbow I crafted. Hmph, all the weapons were taken away back then; I didn’t expect they’d be given to subordinates.” 
“Old man, did you say you made this?” 
In an instant. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s eye brimmed with murderous intent. 
Bill broke out in a cold sweat, and Lin Tian quickly intervened to stop the farce. “Alright, alright, Gobu Yue, Lia, they are my allies from now on. Ifreya, since you’re here, treat her wound, would you?” 
“Yes, Master.” 
Upon hearing this. 
Lia felt a wave of guilt and couldn’t even meet the One-Eyed Owl’s gaze. 
However, the One-Eyed Owl didn’t seem to care at all. “This elf is really tempting, huh? You must have gone through hell with her, haha!” 
“Gobu Yue, show them around the city. I have some matters to attend to.” 
Lin Tian instructed, then left. 
He needed to find the Yeti Tribe and bring them to Twilight City, then establish a large magic array. 
He planned to teleport the goblin army, dwarves, and dragons all back. 
And deal with all the humans in Twilight City, allowing the goblins to fully take control of the city. 
Meanwhile, under Gobu Yue’s lead, the One-Eyed Owl and the others began to explore the city. 
The moment they stepped out of the palace. 
They were all stunned. 
“What’s going on? Am I seeing this right? Isn’t this the Goblin Empire? Why are there so many monsters?” 
“Damn, humans! There are even humans selling things? What’s with that werewolf? Bargaining with a human?” 
“It’s just like walking through the old streets; you wouldn’t even know this was a goblin-ruled empire!” 
“I can’t believe it; is Lin Tian really a goblin?” 
The bustling, harmonious scene. 
It felt strangely familiar, like casually strolling through the streets back home. 
Bill was the first to notice a shop named “Bunny Girl Tavern.” 
“Let’s head inside for a drink first! Come on, let’s go!” 
Aside from the Flame Dragon Mother and Little Black, who decided to wander around on their own, the One-Eyed Owl and the others followed suit and entered the tavern. 
When they saw the bunny girls—each wearing high heels, black fishnet stockings, and sporting naturally cute bunny ears with long legs almost reaching into your lap—they felt as if they had entered paradise. Their eyes went wide with amazement. 
No matter how expensive the drink was, they had to have one! 
“Welcome to the Bunny Girl Tavern, gentlemen and ladies! Would you like to try our latest drink? It’s only 10 gold coins per glass!” 
A bunny girl waitress immediately approached and greeted them. 
Upon hearing this, the One-Eyed Owl cursed, “Ten gold coins? Are you insane? What kind of drink is worth ten gold coins?!” 
“Oh, it’s our special mouth-chewed sake made by Miss Willisiana herself!” 
The waitress pointed to the side. 
They saw a few counters near the bar where several pure and adorable young bunny girls were sitting. They took glutinous rice into their mouths, chewed it slowly and carefully for a long time, then spat the juice into the distilled sake. 
The milky white rice juice dripped down their rosy lips, with a few drops even clinging to their pale chins. 
Slowly, it trickled down. 
Just watching it made the drink look delicious! 
The distilled sake itself was rather tasteless. 
But with the addition of this thick, sweet rice juice and the essence of the young girls, it transformed into something extraordinary. 
In an instant. 
Bill pulled out his money, “Let’s start with ten glasses.” 
Grugia and Osius also chimed in, “I’ll take ten as well, freshly made, please. We’re not just here for the drink, you know? We’re simply interested in experiencing the unique customs and traditions of other races!” 
“Exactly! It’s all about the culture!” Osius nodded enthusiastically. 
The other members of the Dragon Slayer Guild followed suit, rushing to place their orders. 
The waitress beamed with delight. “Alright, gentlemen, please wait a moment! The bunny girls are preparing it for you!” 
“No problem, take your time. The longer they chew, the sweeter and more flavorful the juice will be.” Bill said, gesturing like a professional connoisseur. 
The One-Eyed Owl and Adele, along with a few other women, couldn’t understand the appeal, “Just bring us the strongest drinks you have!” 
They preferred something stronger. 
As for Gobu Yue, she didn’t drink alcohol at all. 
Before long. 
Osius and the others finally received the mouth-chewed sake they had been eagerly awaiting. 
They began to sip it slowly. 
“My God! I’ve been drinking for years, but I’ve never tasted anything so delicious!” 
“Exactly, exactly! The Goblin Empire is amazing! You can fully enjoy the unique flavors of other races here!” 
“Such a fine drink, ten gold coins is a bargain!” 
Even Bill, as he drank, was left wanting more. “You all don’t understand alcohol! Let me give you a proper review… 
The taste is dense at first! Then, it’s like a rapidly melting shard of ice, filling your entire mouth with a uniquely delightful sensation! And it’s so smooth going down, absolutely sublime! From now on, this will be my drink of choice!” 
Hearing this. 
A nearby serpent-person, also enjoying a drink, couldn’t help but remark, “At ten gold coins per glass, you couldn’t afford to keep drinking this regularly.” 
“What’s there to worry about? Us old folks should get back to work, build the nation, and earn some more money!” Bill replied enthusiastically. 
Though he struck a respectable pose, not many people in the tavern gave him a favorable look. 
“Old perv is still an old perv, talking like he knows what he’s doing…” 
“This sake is just clear liquor with a bit of rice flavor, but listen to his review. You’d think he was drinking a divine brew.” 
“Seriously, I haven’t seen a dwarf in decades, and now they’re all shameless?” 
People whispered behind his back. 
Bill’s face flushed red with embarrassment, “What are you talking about? I’ve been drinking my whole life; do you really think you know better than me? If you don’t believe me, come have a drink! Whoever gets drunk first loses!” 
No one bothered to respond. 
At that moment, Gobu Kuang strolled up to the tavern, “Huh? You’re all here? What a coincidence. Enjoy your drinks!” 
“Sure thing, brother!” Osius replied. 
Seeing this, the waitress was surprised, “You know Brother Kuang? In that case, we’ll give each of you an extra glass of mouth-chewed sake, on the house!” 
“Take good care of them. I’ll continue my patrol.” Gobu Kuang chuckled. 
They patrolled the city every day to prevent any ill-intentioned sub-humans or monsters from causing trouble. 
This was why the city remained so peaceful. 
Otherwise, the bunny girls might have already been taken advantage of by the tavern’s monstrous patrons. 
Many sub-humans and monsters entered the Goblin City with mischievous intentions, but after witnessing the methods of the patrolling guards, they all behaved themselves. 
On the streets. 
Gobu Kuang wandered around like a local king. Every vendor he passed greeted him warmly and offered him gifts. 
At that moment, a red-scaled lizard woman rushed over from afar, “Brother Kuang, Brother Kuang! My things were stolen by the Wild Fang Boarmen this morning. I collected those goods with great effort to sell for a few coins, just to buy some milk for my kids, sob sob…” 
“Is that so? Take me to them!” 
Gobu Kuang’s eyes narrowed, revealing a sinister smile. 
Soon, they arrived at a street where many Wild Fang Boarmen gathered. With the red-scaled lizard woman’s guidance, they found the culprits. 
At that moment, the boarman was sitting outside a shop, munching on some unknown, pitch-black, foul-smelling food. 
Suddenly, he felt a chill down his spine. 
He quickly turned his head, “Brother Kuang! What brings you here? Would you like to try some of our boarman cuisine? I can get you a serving!” 
“I’ll ask you this—did you take the fruits she collected?” Gobu Kuang asked, not saying much more. 
Thud! 
“Brother Kuang, heaven and earth as my witness, I didn’t take them! I just tried a little, but it didn’t taste good, so I didn’t buy any!” The boarman pleaded, immediately dropping to his knees. 
However, the red-scaled lizard woman corrected him, “He says he only tasted a little, but he ate all of it! Those were Death Fruits I painstakingly gathered from the cliffs. They’re incredibly rare.” 
Gobu Kuang grabbed the boarman, who stood over three meters tall and weighed at least a thousand pounds, and lifted him effortlessly. “You’d better be honest with me. If you’re lying… hmph, I can’t guarantee you’ll make it out of this alive.”
