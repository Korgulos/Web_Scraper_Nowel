Chapter 139: Blocked by the One-Eyed Owl! 
TL: Sungmin 
In an instant. 
Lin Tian looked at the most contemptuous red-haired girl. 
She was young, but her words were so venomous, even more goblin-like than goblins themselves. 
Sometimes, words were the sharpest knives. 
Her chilling, icy gaze made the red-haired girl shiver slightly. “Why are you looking at me like that? Do you want to kill me? This is a village!” 
Saying this, she brandished a wooden stick and jabbed it towards Lin Tian. 
The original owner had often been ostracized by them and never resisted, always ingratiating himself, which made them so brazen. 
Lin Tian snatched the stick from her hand, poised to hit her. 
He questioned, “Since you say I’m a murderous demon, aren’t you afraid that I really am?” 
“Come on, come on, murderous demon. If you have the guts, hit me. The village won’t let you go! Hmph!” 
The red-haired girl not only didn’t fear but stood with her hands on her hips. 
The others were the same, full of disdain. 
“Poof!” 
But in the next second. 
The heavy wooden stick jabbed straight into her venomous mouth, her teeth scattered all over the ground! 
However, Lin Tian controlled his strength and did not kill. 
He just made sure she could never speak again in her life. 
With a casual swing of the stick, the others were mostly left crippled. 
They lay on the ground, dragging their broken legs and crying in pain. 
“Tell me, where is the Dragon Slayer Guild?” Lin Tian demanded.  
They were only beaten up; it wasn’t enough to scare them into silence. 
Facing the threat of the stick, someone immediately spilled, “Just head north all the way, don’t kill me, boohoo!” 
He then turned around. Looking at the red-haired girl picking up her teeth and crying on the ground. 
He reached out and lifted her like a toy, coldly saying, “From now on, you should know when to keep your mouth shut, right?” 
Then, he tore off her skirt. 
The other girls were terrified to the extreme, struggling to crawl towards the village. 
Afraid that they would end up like the red-haired girl. 
Lin Tian threw her to the ground, sparing her life, ensuring she would remember the consequences of her foul mouth for the rest of her life. 
“North, is it? Here I come.” 
Looking at the distant sky, he took a carnivorous horse from the village entrance and set off. 
The villagers behind him shouted for blood, but they couldn’t catch up. 
Seeing the miserable red-haired girl, the village chief sighed, understanding why it ended this way, “You really brought this on yourself…” 
“Waaah, waaah, aaaah…” 
The red-haired girl lay on the ground, not only her mouth but her body was also bleeding. 
Seeing it was Lin Tian, also known as Andy, who did it. 
Everyone could guess why he acted this way, having often been ridiculed and humiliated by this girl. 
He finally couldn’t hold it in anymore. 
So, the village chief didn’t pursue him but watched Lin Tian leave, in a way, his conscience saved the village. 
If they had caught up, Lin Tian couldn’t guarantee he would spare them. 
After a burst of fast riding. 
He finally saw a city before dawn, with the grand giant dragon-head statue with a sword. 
It was the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Though the sky was just starting to brighten, it was already bustling inside. 
Lin Tian let the carnivorous horse go and entered the city. 
Seeing various foods on the streets, he felt a bit hungry. 
Although not comparable to the buns and dough sticks he used to eat, it had this world’s unique flavors. 
Fried eight-eyed lizard, very crispy and fragrant. A special creature of this world, similar to a cross between a spider and a lizard, extremely delicious. 
Tree milk. Just like its name, it was milk squeezed from a milk tree, sweet and naturally fragrant. 
However, it was something only the wealthy could afford in this continent. 
Ordinary people usually had porridge for breakfast. 
There were so many delicacies here because the Dragon Slayer Guild was a tourist city, attracting people with money and strength. 
Lin Tian found it tempting too. 
It was his first time closely experiencing human civilization in this world. 
But when he checked his pockets. 
There was nothing. 
There were no gold coins in his space ring either; most of what he robbed from Clin Castle had been used to forge weapons. 
Occupying the Lionheart Empire, he hadn’t plundered the people’s wealth. 
After all, money was useless to goblins. 
Now it seemed, he needed to consider economic development in the future. 
Since he couldn’t afford anything, Lin Tian decided to be cunning. “Boss, how much for the tree milk?” 
“One silver coin per bowl.” The fat middle-aged man in front of him in linen clothes smiled and said. 
Lin Tian drank two bowls in one go, finding it much tastier than he imagined, like drinking fruit juice with a milk flavor. 
“Two silver coins, please.” The fat man made a gesture. 
But in the next second, Lin Tian vanished, sprinting away. 
The quick-moving fat uncle hadn’t even reacted yet. 
Meanwhile, Lin Tian also took a few fried lizards. 
Soon, he reached the less crowded central area, which was the entrance of the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Lin Tian tried knocking on the door, but there was no response. 
So early in the morning, those guys were probably still asleep, so he climbed over the wall directly. 
However, upon entering, he realized they weren’t sleeping at all. 
They simply couldn’t hear the knocking. 
The guildhall was still as lively as ever, with everyone drinking. 
People gathered around, partying hard. 
There were several giant wooden beer barrels around, filled with craft beer, which tasted excellent. 
In one night, thirty to forty people would drink it all. 
Lin Tian stood at the entrance, unsure of how to start a conversation. 
Should he say he came to visit? 
But this place didn’t seem to be open to outsiders. 
He could only say he came to register for the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Joining them would make it easier to understand them. 
“Alright, let’s do that.” 
Lin Tian nodded to himself, preparing to turn around and leave, then knock loudly to attract attention. 
He would then naturally say he came to join the guild. 
If caught sneaking in, he would be lucky not to get beaten up, let alone join the guild. 
However, as he turned around. 
He saw a woman taller than himself standing behind him at some point. 
Her dark skin looked incredibly smooth and supple. 
Her muscular build outlined beautiful curves. 
She wore an extremely short tube top, with her abs moving with each breath, exuding beauty. 
And a skirt shorter than Lin Tian’s underwear. 
One could say she resembled one of the sacred beasts, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, or Azure Dragon. 
Otherwise, he would have seen everything. 
Her legs were exceptionally long, reaching up to Lin Tian’s waist. 
Her well-sculpted thighs gave Lin Tian the feeling that a single kick from her could kill him.

Seeing the tall and robust woman in front of him, Lin Tian instantly understood! 
The One-Eyed Owl! The Guild Master of the Dragon Slayer Guild! 
With over 10,000 combat power, even Douglas wasn’t as strong as her! Wouldn’t he be instantly killed? 
“Ha? So you’re the one knocking early in the morning? And sneaking into someone’s house?” The One-Eyed Owl yawned, speaking coldly. 
A moment ago, her face had looked cute and sleepy. 
But now, it showed a hungry tiger’s fierceness! 
Her long-lashed, enchanting purple eye was full of amusement and killing intent. 
Her mouth curved up, revealing a sharp tiger tooth. 
This wasn’t a compliment. 
It felt like she could actually bite you to death with that tiger tooth. 
Lin Tian was so scared he pressed himself against the door, quickly thinking, “Big Sis, I’m sorry, I just wanted to join the Dragon Slayer Guild.” 
“Big Sis? Kid, do you have two eyes for nothing?” 
The One-Eyed Owl’s voice was filled with threat as she placed her hand on Lin Tian’s head. 
If she applied even a little force, his brains would splatter instantly! 
Lin Tian couldn’t withstand that. 
This woman was purely an offensive warrior, with no magical skills, just close combat techniques. 
Her attribute panel exceeded a basic 5,000. 
Her attack power was a full 500 higher! 
One could see how terrifying her strength was. 
Lin Tian realized he might have misspoken, “Sister, I apologize, I’m just in awe of your heroic presence and couldn’t help but come in.” 
“Kid, I like what you’re saying, but sneaking into someone’s house deserves a good lesson.” The One-Eyed Owl said, immediately launching a high kick! 
“Boom!” 
A hard stone wall three centimeters above Lin Tian’s head was kicked out of a large hole! 
The entire hall shook. 
Her speed was so fast it was impossible to react! 
If it had been slightly lower, his head would have exploded! 
However, Lin Tian found her movements somewhat enchanting. 
The high-lifted leg, if he moved a bit forward, would perfectly close the piston. 
But he didn’t dare move even an inch now. 
“Oi! You guys keep drinking all the time, wasting so much beer. Do you think our guild is a charity?” 
The One-Eyed Owl inexplicably ignored Lin Tian and walked inside. 
The door had already shattered, so there was no need to open it. 
Lin Tian found it strange; her state seemed like she had just woken up from a hangover, probably craving more beer. 
Do all creatures in this war empire love drinking so much? 
Dwarves did, and so did these guys. 
“Boss? You’re too lame! Slept so long, hurry up and fill your glass!” 
“Grugia, don’t be smug. Big Sis is here; watch her drink you under the table!” 
“Boss, you’re warming up early in the morning? The door got smashed.” 
Everyone was talking. 
At the table, a man stood firm while several were passed out under the table. 
The One-Eyed Owl shook her head, her messy hair swaying. 
She cursed, “A bunch of bastards, no one helped me back to bed when I got drunk. Almost slept in the gutter at the door.” 
She was angry recalling the previous night’s drunken fall into the gutter. 
“We wouldn’t dare help you back…” Someone said bitterly. 
They all wanted to help but didn’t dare. 
“If I lost control under the influence of alcohol and did something I shouldn’t, wouldn’t that be the end?” 
“No worries, just move into a new home, the cemetery behind the guild, hahaha!” 
“Boss, when will you find a man? Can you hold back this much? I just found a girlfriend. She held back for days, then after once, clung to me every day, ha!” 
The One-Eyed Owl slapped the speaker hard, “Get lost, your little slut is no match for me! My pleasure only comes from hunting, not from useless men!” 
… 
Big Sis is also used as a title of authority here.
