Chapter 111: Rebecca Exposed 
TL: Sungmin 
“Pope!” 
At this moment, it seemed that the holy light in everyone’s hearts extinguished. 
There was only endless darkness shrouded by monsters! 
A heavy sense of oppression and defeat weighed down on the people of the Empire and the Church, making even walking difficult. 
Veronica looked at the Pope’s corpse with great satisfaction. “No one can contend with me. No matter how powerful you once were, what does it matter now?” 
“The difference between the master and them is that the master still possesses a top-tier mind. I truly adore the master!” 
Rebecca wished she could give a tight hug. 
In her joy, Veronica glanced around and asked, “By the way, where is Alice? Only she is worthy to be my attendant. The value of these goblins is gone. If you want to vent, kill them at will.” 
Rebecca had endured Lin Tian for a long time. 
Now, she certainly had the chance to vent her anger. 
“I had her take the followers to occupy the royal city.” 
Rebecca explained, casually killing goblins who looked at her with lewd eyes. 
Any goblins within a ten-meter radius of her were slaughtered. 
She continued, “Goblins, these low-level creatures, the more I look at them, the more disgusting they become. Master, do we still need to keep Lin Tian? If not, I really want to twist his head off! He always gives me a stinky face, as if he’s somebody important!” 
“He can be a follower, but he is definitely not fit to be my attendant or servant.” Veronica pondered. 
Followers were equivalent to three-headed dogs or cyclopes. 
They were just servants meant for work and death. 
But she thought again and spoke, “However, if it makes you happy, killing him is also fine. There will always be someone to replace him.” 
Saying this, she noticed Rebecca’s expression and voice became slightly more coquettish. 
Yes, they indeed had a special relationship in private. 
Rebecca blushed slightly, “Master is so good to me. By then, let’s hang Lin Tian’s head in the Dark Temple.” 
Having endured for so long, she could finally act as she wished. 
She was the second-in-command of the Great Tomb, the close aide of the Bone King. 
She had already thought of countless ways to exact revenge. 
Veronica said nothing more. 
Instead, she looked at the Holy Mother, ready to end the war. 
“Ah? Your Highness the Holy Mother, why don’t you join our Great Tomb? I can give you a chance to try to win me over, how about that?” 
When she saw the gentle and lovely Holy Mother, radiating a glow of compassion. 
Veronica’s heart softened. 
She extended a skeletal hand from her high position, trying to pull her up from the ground. 
Beside her, Rebecca was obviously jealous, but thought better of it. Being able to add to the harem, she could also enjoy herself. 
And there was Alice, a sweet and fragrant human. 
Thinking further, it was almost too good to be true. 
Brutal, standing nearby, was stunned, “Damn, the boss’s harem is being taken over, where is he?” 
Looking at the two terrifying monsters. 
He could only helplessly hide far away. 
“Get away, you monsters! Is there nothing in your eyes but slaughter and lust?!” 
The Holy Mother knelt on the ground, crying helplessly. 
Veronica still tried to persuade her, “Don’t be like this, don’t you want to survive?” 
“Hmph, if I feared death, I wouldn’t be here! Kill me if you want!” 
The Holy Mother closed her beautiful eyes, resolute and unyielding. 
Veronica sighed, “Life is such a beautiful thing, yet the Evil God Cult brainwashed you like this. Do you know how much I cherish life?” 
“Since you don’t cherish your own life, don’t blame me for being ruthless. What a pity!” 
Veronica prepared to eliminate her completely. 
Suddenly, she hastily used summoning magic, “Heretical Summon · Caesar’s Disc Creature!” 
A black shield-like creature appeared, blocking the sneak attack from behind! 
This creature was killed in a single strike. 
All the monsters became alert. 
Rebecca looked at the attacker in surprise, “Corpse Pope? Impossible! Master, be careful!” 
The Corpse Pope launched another frenzied attack, golden magic circles appearing in the sky. 
“World-class Magic · Heaven’s Fall!” 
“Buzz!” 
A massive pressure swept across the Laiyang Plains. 
Many weaker goblins exploded into blood mist! 
Veronica quickly counterattacked, “Heretical Summon · Undead Mountain!” 
A towering mountain rose from the ground! 
It forcibly shattered the Corpse Pope’s magic circle. 
However, using Heretical Summon twice in a row made Veronica somewhat weak. 
She couldn’t help but say, “How is this possible? Where are the monsters controlling him? Why can you still use holy magic!” 
This was a corpse, part of the undead, equivalent to a monster. 
Even she found it unscientific. 
Very abnormal. 
“Why? Because I am Noklando, one of the Twelve Popes!” 
The voice of the Corpse Pope echoed. 
Veronica’s expression changed dramatically. “Your soul, wasn’t it in the depths of the Dark Realm?!” 
Decades ago, during the great battle, a heretical Dementor had been summoned and had taken Noklando’s soul. 
Unexpectedly, the soul had returned. 
“Hmph, it’s all thanks to my father, Pope Douglas, who brought my soul back from the Dark Realm!” the Corpse Pope coldly stated, his body slowly decaying. 
However, he now had absolute confidence in defeating Veronica. 
Because in his hand was the old Pope’s world-class magical artifact, the Endless Holy Grail. 
The ‘Endless Holy Grail’ could store a massive amount of holy power, which was why he, as a dead man, could still use world-class holy magic. 
In an instant! 
Triple Heaven’s Fall! 
The massive Undead Mountain was crushed and shattered! 
Countless monsters screamed and turned into blood water! 
Luckily, Gobu Kuang, Gobu Shan, and others had followed Alice to the royal city. 
But Brutal was not so fortunate. 
He was crushed until blood flowed from his seven orifices, and his muscles and bones twisted! 
Rebecca was also pressed to the point where she couldn’t breathe, her proud body trembling, and she hurriedly used her charm counterattack. 
However, it had no effect, as the opponent was now a corpse. 
Where would there be any lust? 
Veronica suddenly realized, having been careless, that bringing the old Pope into the Dark Realm had instead aided them. 
She gritted her teeth and said, “Why resist so pointlessly? You’re only harming this world!” 
The Corpse Pope’s eyes were full of disdain. “Before I turn to ashes, you will be crushed into dust first!” 
“Heretical Summon · Ulm, the Dominator of Eldritch!” 
On the foundation of Heaven’s Fall, five magic circles unfolded directly! 
Everything seemed to freeze. 
Thick clouds were parted by an invisible force. 
The twilight sun shone on the ground, with the blood on countless corpses reflecting the light brilliantly. 
Strange yet beautiful. 
A giant black silhouette appeared before the setting sun, like a descending god! 
With a gentle wave, the Triple Heaven’s Fall shattered! 
This was a god among heresies. 
The Corpse Pope had not expected this; the terrifying oppression was unprecedented! 
Compared to him, Veronica was nothing. 
If such a monster appeared, everything would be over. 
Immediately. 
Veronica forcibly closed the magic circle, but the black silhouette extended a hand to block it, though his eyes were unseen, it felt as if he were observing the world. 
Full of curiosity, an evil curiosity! 
“Damn it!” 
Veronica cursed silently, “It’s all your fault for opposing me. Now this world has attracted the attention of an Eldritch God!” 
She had never intended to use this magic. 
Not only was it hugely consuming, but it also attracted terrifying creatures from other worlds. If they forcibly broke in. 
Even she couldn’t imagine what would happen. 
Fortunately, under the pressure of the magic circle, the black silhouette was forced back. 
The Corpse Pope’s expression was heavy. “You madmen, the world will be destroyed by you sooner or later… God, bring down your gospel, save us all…” 
As he spoke, his body began to crumble, decomposing rapidly like grains of sand. 
Eventually, it was blown away by the wind. 
“Damn, the power of the Eldritch God is terrifying. Help me up, Rebecca.” Veronica trembled, finding it difficult to move. 
After all, that was a true God. 
Summoning it nearly drained her to the marrow. 
Rebecca hurriedly supported her, “It’s alright, Master. We have already won. You can return to your former life. We, and Alice, can live happily together.” 
Around them, only a few creatures remained alive. 
Most of the goblins had been wiped out by Heaven’s Fall, and there were no survivors from the Empire. 
Twisted corpses littered the field. 
The entire Laiyang Plains were filled with the pungent smell of blood. 
Only a few hero variants and cross guards survived. 
But those who survived were half-dead, lacking any combat power. 
Even the Black Goat Spawn had fallen unresponsive to the ground. 
“After enduring for decades, what does it matter how strong the Church is or how much they restrain us monsters? They still lost…” Veronica exclaimed excitedly. 
The Church of the once mighty Lionheart Empire had been the strongest among many Catholic churches. 
Now, it had been dismantled by her. 
At this moment, a familiar figure came running, respectful and excited, “Master Demon Lord, did you win? That’s great, hahaha!” 
It was Lin Tian. 
Behind him were a large group of goblins. 
He had previously requested Veronica to set up teleportation magic circles in various areas for his management convenience. 
Except for the one leading to the Great Tomb, he could use the other magic circles at will. 
So he had directly transported the goblin army from the snowy plains. 
Veronica’s expression shifted slightly, “You recovered from your injuries so quickly? And what’s with those goblins?” 
Rebecca’s face was full of disdain. If she weren’t supporting the Bone King, she would have already moved to teach him a lesson. 
Lin Tian explained with a grin, “I was only lightly injured. They are all here to help.” 
Help? 
Veronica’s expression became serious. 
The thousand goblins before her were all leader variants! 
She had been paying attention to the consumption of monster resources in the Great Tomb, which shouldn’t have been enough to cultivate so many leader variant goblins. 
“Master, don’t waste time talking to him. Since there are so many leaders, let’s take them all as followers. We just need to kill him,” Rebecca finally said. 
If Lin Tian was killed, these leader variants would lose their boss. 
Then they would willingly join the Great Tomb. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian’s face darkened. This damn succubus, finally revealing her true nature? 
But today, he would make them both wish they were dead! 
Now was the best time to act and reap the fruits of victory.
