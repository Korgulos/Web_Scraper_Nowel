Chapter 217: The Final Step, Troy Empire! 
TL: Sungmin  
“It’s about time. I need to claim the boss’s benefits too, hehe!” Gobu Kuang said with a wicked grin. 
One by one, the others collected their benefits and left. 
Master Bill, looking as if he had nothing to lose, said, “Just getting a taste is enough for me! Let’s go, Little Fang.” 
Soon enough. 
Only Lin Tian and the One-Eyed Owl remained in the tavern, still drinking. 
There was also the bunny girl hostess keeping them company. 
Looking at the One-Eyed Owl, who was already completely drunk, the hostess couldn’t help but say, “Princess Elizabeth, you’re drunk. If you ask me, just admit you’ve lost…” 
As she spoke, she cast a flirtatious glance at Lin Tian. 
This was another way to play along. 
The One-Eyed Owl slurred, “I’m not drunk. I don’t accept it… I don’t…” 
Judging by her state, she was on the verge of falling under the table at any moment but kept stubbornly holding on. 
The bunny girl hostess sighed helplessly, never having seen someone so stubborn, and couldn’t do much to help. 
Seeing this, Lin Tian felt a bit disappointed inside. “It seems Big Sis has her reasons for not wanting to lose. I guess I’ll count this round as my loss. I have some things to take care of, so I’ll be off.” 
“Wait! Don’t act like you’re pitying me! I didn’t lose! Normally, I’d already have outdrunk you by now! Something’s off here!” One-Eyed Owl couldn’t figure it out. 
She had a record of every time Lin Tian got drunk, thanks to Bill’s help. Then, she had trained by drinking just enough to get used to surpassing that amount over time. 
Yet now, she couldn’t hold on, while Lin Tian was still steady as a rock. 
There was no way she could let this go. 
Lin Tian felt a bit guilty upon hearing this. It seemed like he should’ve acted more convincingly—he miscalculated. 
To win over the One-Eyed Owl using this tactic… she wasn’t a fool. 
But what he didn’t expect was for the One-Eyed Owl to suddenly climb onto the table, grabbing his collar. “I know what you’re scheming, you little brat! Fine, we’ll drink while you do whatever it is you’re thinking about!” 
The moment those words came out, the atmosphere in the room froze solid. 
“Ha… ha…” 
The One-Eyed Owl’s hot breath, mixed with a youthful fragrance and the scent of alcohol, brushed against Lin Tian’s face. 
Looking at her perfect, oval-shaped face, her sexy wheat-colored skin… 
And the faint blush of a young girl. 
At that moment, Lin Tian didn’t want to say anything. What he once dared not dream of was now right in front of him! 
Since the One-Eyed Owl had already come this far, what more was there to say? 
Wasn’t this exactly what he wanted? 
Just as he was about to kiss her, she shoved him away with a big hand. “What are you doing?” 
“You’re blocking my mouth. How am I supposed to drink like that?” she snapped, annoyed. 
It seemed she didn’t care about that at all, only about drinking! 
Lin Tian almost passed out from frustration. Since the direct approach wasn’t working… 
He decided to take a different route. 
“Spurt!” 
Right then, the One-Eyed Owl’s strong body shivered, and she spat out a mouthful of alcohol. 
Her beautiful eyes widened in shock! 
Her expression reflected the deep sensation of something completely unfamiliar! 
Panic set in. 
She hurriedly grabbed her cup, downing a large gulp to try and calm herself. 
But in her panic, much of the alcohol spilled from her mouth, slowly trailing down her neck. 
Some of it even dripped into Lin Tian’s mouth by accident. 
“Your turn to drink!” the One-Eyed Owl snapped, shoving a full cup at him. 
Lin Tian didn’t refuse, downing it in one go. “Big Sis, you should put the cup down first. I’m afraid you might break it in a moment.” 
“What… what do you mean? You think I can’t hold onto a simple cup? I told you, I’m not drunk yet! I won’t get drunk before you do!” she said stubbornly, her face flushed. 
Lin Tian didn’t know how to respond for a moment. “Well, it’s not really about being drunk… but I suppose it’s similar. It’s because of my God’s Blessing ability.” 
Hearing that, the One-Eyed Owl paused, mumbling, “What’s the big deal? I’m not afraid!” 
But saying she wasn’t afraid was a lie. 
Who didn’t know what goblins were capable of? 
Her heart began to race even faster. 
Lin Tian showed no mercy either—after all, the One-Eyed Owl wasn’t a delicate person. Her physique was robust, and her combat ability was top-tier. 
Not to mention, she was the descendant of a demigod. 
Finally. 
Things escalated to that inevitable point. 
The sensation was unlike anything the One-Eyed Owl had ever felt before, her mind going completely blank, with nothing but a ringing in her ears. 
She even felt her vision blur. 
“Ha… ha… ha… So strange! What did you do to me, you little brat!” 
Unable to control her strength, she nearly crushed Lin Tian. “You… you need to calm down! Big Sis! I’m about to cough up blood!” 
“I can’t calm down! This feels way too strange!” The One-Eyed Owl bit down hard on her lip, even drawing blood. 
Her slender fingers were desperately grasping for something, anything. 
Crack! 
The wine glass in her hand shattered under the pressure! 
The bunny girl hostess, her nose bleeding from excitement, exclaimed, “Being with Princess Elizabeth is truly dangerous! Goblin Majesty, take care!” 
Thankfully, not long after, the power of the God’s Blessing kicked in. 
No matter how strong the female was, she would become as helpless as a toy in his hand, losing all resistance. 
Even the One-Eyed Owl! 
The woman, known as the Wild Lioness, now felt completely out of control. 
Her face was filled with shame. 
“I, I…” she stammered, trying to say something but as if her words were stuck. 
She couldn’t believe she truly had no strength to resist Lin Tian, and yet… she couldn’t bring herself to stop him either. 
It was just like what had happened with Sara. 
At first, there was resistance, but slowly, she accepted it, and by the end, she completely gave in and enjoyed it. 
That’s just how people were. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but laugh, “Big Sis, have you lost yet?” 
“I… I haven’t lost! Why are you suddenly bringing that up again?” the One-Eyed Owl muttered bashfully, her voice trembling slightly. 
Lin Tian teased, “Still won’t admit defeat? That’s not like you at all. Well, in that case, I’ll just head out!” 
“You! What do you mean? Are you trying to embarrass me on purpose? Trying to humiliate me? Do you believe I won’t fight you to the death?” she retorted angrily. 
The One-Eyed Owl was furious, fully understanding what Lin Tian was trying to do. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian, knowing the jig was up, stopped teasing her, “Alright, alright, don’t get mad. Relax, have some fun!” 
“You’re still talking!” The One-Eyed Owl was both angry and helpless. 
Thankfully, apart from the bunny girl hostess, there was no one else around. 
Otherwise, she would’ve preferred to die out of embarrassment! 
After a while, rustling sounds came from upstairs—seemed like people were starting to come down. 
Lin Tian decided to stop there. After all, the One-Eyed Owl had a reputation to maintain, unlike Sara, who was purely a servant. 
The One-Eyed Owl quickly composed herself, and the alcohol began to wear off. 
But the flush on her face only deepened. 
Suddenly, she hoisted Lin Tian onto her shoulder and headed outside. 
Lin Tian, surprised, asked, “Big Sis, what are you doing? Don’t tell me you’re going to kill me to silence me?!” 
Damn, he regretted this! 
Sure, it had been amazing, and his combat strength had improved by over a thousand. 
But losing his life over this? That would be a huge loss! 
“Shut up! Those annoying people ruined my fun. I’ll deal with them after I’ve had my fill!” The One-Eyed Owl declared seriously, though her words were mortifying. 
Lin Tian was stunned. 
No wonder she was Big Sis. While everyone else could barely walk, she was still saying she hadn’t had enough! 
With a sly grin, he replied, “Alright then, I’ll give it my all. Just make sure you punish them properly later.” 
“You…! Are you trying to humiliate me more?” The One-Eyed Owl snapped, embarrassed and angry. 
… 
Days later. 
The sun rose as usual. 
The growth of the Goblin Empire surged forward at a terrifying pace, like a flood. 
Even Master Bill was unsure about the city-building plans since they kept surpassing their limits every day. 
In the palace. 
Lin Tian gathered everyone to hold a council, preparing for an attack on the Troy Empire. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s gaze was now tinged with shyness, occasionally avoiding his eyes. 
The others, however, were filled with utmost loyalty—especially the Dragon Slayer Guild members, who had never experienced such privilege before. 
They were fortunate to have found a wise leader like Lin Tian. 
“The human empires within the wilderness… there’s basically only Troy left, right?” Lin Tian said thoughtfully. 
Alice responded, “That’s right, but it’s also the strongest empire. With thousands of years of rich heritage and culture, it will be the toughest opponent to defeat.” 
The One-Eyed Owl scoffed, “So what? I’ll conquer it for you, and in exchange, you’ll be mine for a month. How about that?” 
“What?!” Everyone stared at her in shock, wondering if they had misheard. 
Osius and Grugia suddenly realized, “So, Big Bro Lin Tian and Big Sis have been missing for days because… they’ve become a thing!” 
“Boss, you actually tamed this fierce woman? Congrats, congrats!” Gobu Kuang and the others chuckled wickedly. 
The One-Eyed Owl glared, “What are you all looking at? Got a problem?” 
She wasn’t trying to hide it anymore. After all, happiness was something you had to fight for yourself. 
Lin Tian felt a bit bitter. Honestly, if it were someone else, he could probably endure a month. 
But with the One-Eyed Owl? That might be too much for him. 
Helplessly, he said, “Big Sis, come on, don’t joke around. There’s no way you can conquer the Troy Empire by yourself.” 
“Master, I also wish to lead an army to conquer Troy!” To everyone’s surprise, Alice stepped forward and said. 
Her fair face was full of determination. 
The One-Eyed Owl wasn’t pleased, but before she could respond, someone else spoke up. 
Sara knelt by Lin Tian’s side, saying softly, “Your Majesty, what about me…” 
Seeing this, Lin Tian grew more serious. “Alright, let’s focus on business. My plan is to first use all our forces to overwhelm the Troy Empire with sheer power. Then, I’ll be ‘captured’ by Sara, allowing her to ‘save’ the Troy Empire.” 
He continued, “At that point, we’ll establish Sara as the new queen. In the future, she can help us in the fight against the Demigod Empires outside the wilderness.” 
Perhaps the Trojans couldn’t defeat Lin Tian, given that he had the aid of dwarves, dragons, and even the Zerg.  
However, when it came to battling demigods, they had more experience. 
Upon hearing this, no one objected. 
“We’ll follow your lead.” 
“Whatever the boss decides, we’ll do!” 
“You know best in this area, so let’s go with that.” 
With everyone in agreement, Lin Tian began giving orders. “Alright, Big Sis, go notify the Ancient Dragons. Gobu Yue, inform the Dwarves and have them come to bolster our forces. Alice, start assembling the army.”
