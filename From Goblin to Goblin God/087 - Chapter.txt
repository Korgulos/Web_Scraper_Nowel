Chapter 87: Lin Tian: How Did I Become a Queen? 
TL: Sungmin  
AN:  (The chapter number is wrong, everyone. This is chapter 86, but we’ll continue on like this.) 
“Hmm? Why haven’t we seen a single one today?” Brooks was puzzled, looking around. 
It was unusually quiet. 
Carmen joked while flattering, “Ghouls are timid creatures. Could it be that they sensed our Dennis and hid out of fear?” 
“Haha, that must be it. Let’s go into the forest and find them.” Brooks laughed. 
Little did they know that this joke was actually true. 
Ghouls only fed on corpses, which was enough to prove their cowardice. They had sensed the demonic aura from Lin Tian from afar! 
And it was a particularly strong one. 
In terms of strength, Lin Tian had already reached four thousand during the bloody battle in Bright Town a long time ago. Recently, he had also dealt with the top-tier Flame Dragon Mother. 
His combat power had now reached five thousand. 
As Lin Tian and his companions entered the forest, the ghouls fled frantically in the darkness, not daring to approach. 
As they got closer, they drove all the ghouls to the edge of the underground palace. 
“Get down! They’re over there, so many of them!” 
Suddenly, Brooks said urgently, lying on the ground, not daring to breathe loudly. 
Lin Tian finally saw the true appearance of the ghouls. 
They were dwarves turned into corpses, already somewhat withered and rotten, with sharp fangs and claws, crawling quickly on the ground like dogs. 
They emitted a creepy low moan. 
They seemed agitated and uneasy. 
“What should we do?! There are at least dozens of them!” 
Carmen’s hands were trembling. If they were discovered, they would surely die. 
But in the next second, Lin Tian walked straight towards the group of ghouls. 
“No, Dennis!” Brooks shouted, but it was too late. 
The ghouls all turned to look at Lin Tian, their ferocious, blood-red eyes seemingly ready to pounce. 
But that was not the reality. 
With each step Lin Tian took, the ghouls retreated in fear, driven to the stone walls of the underground palace, even trying to dig holes to escape. 
One person had frightened dozens of ghouls into submission! 
This incredible scene left Brooks and Carmen utterly shocked. “Who… who is he?! This isn’t right!” 
Lin Tian took out a dust-covered iron sword he had picked up from the guild. 
It was already considered an exceptionally fine sword outside, capable of fetching a high price. 
With a swing of his sword, all the ghouls were cut into pieces! 
None of them resisted. 
They even trembled with fear! 
The two behind him watched in astonishment, their faces full of shock! 
The ghouls that even hundreds of retired dwarf warriors couldn’t defeat were slaughtered like chickens waiting to be killed. 
It felt as if they were slaughtering their own livestock. 
The absolute obedience and fear that livestock had for their owners were vividly reflected in the ghouls. 
They didn’t dare to resist at all! 
“Done, let’s go.” 
Lin Tian picked up the head of the large ghoul and said, knowing that with this trophy, they would surely get recognition. 
He turned to find that the eyes of the two were filled with shock and a trace of fear. 
Brooks quickly forced a smile, “Young man, you’re really amazing. Let’s… let’s go.” 
After speaking, he couldn’t help but wipe the cold sweat from his forehead. 
Back in the kingdom, they went straight to the palace to seek an audience with the king. 
At the gate, they were stopped by the guards, “The king is unwell and cannot see you at the moment.” 
“Hey, look carefully, we solved the ghoul problem!” Brooks cursed. 
The guard’s eyes were filled with admiration and astonishment for Lin Tian, “But, there’s nothing I can do.” 
“Let them in.” 
In the Dwarf Sanctuary, a mature woman’s voice rang out. 
Pushing the door open, they saw a little girl in ceremonial robes sitting inside. She looked like a little girl but exuded the unique aura and mature charm of a ruler. 
Combined with her captivating uniform, it really added to her allure. 
Anyone who saw her would be excited. 
However, Lin Tian did not expect her to be the Dwarf King. 
Brooks said, “Your Majesty the Queen… we are here to claim our reward. This young man, Dennis, has exterminated all the ghouls that threatened the kingdom!” 
“What?” 
The queen was a bit stunned but quickly regained her composure. Her beautiful eyes, full of charm, were fixed on Lin Tian, almost entranced. 
She then said perfunctorily, “The rewards from your guild will be sent later. Dennis, you stay. The others can leave.” 
“Thank you, Your Majesty!” 
Carmen and Brooks were overjoyed and quickly left. 
The entire hall was left with just the queen and Lin Tian. 
Lin Tian held the large ghoul’s head, “Your Majesty, I don’t need gold or anything for my reward. I want to learn forging techniques…” 
“Shh, I need to think carefully about your reward. In this Dwarf Kingdom, there hasn’t been a young man as brave as you in decades.” 
The queen gracefully walked to Lin Tian’s side. 
She playfully stretched out her small hand, cupping Lin Tian’s chin as she admired him. 
With a satisfied smile, she said, “I don’t care about the ghouls. If you want to learn forging techniques, you’ll have to offer something else~.” 
“Your Majesty, if I didn’t kill these ghouls, your entire kingdom will be destroyed in a few months.” 
Lin Tian’s face darkened, growing displeased. 
After all that effort, and now they were reneging? 
If worst came to worst, he could just take what he wanted by force. He could even take a bunch of lolis back and have fun with them. 
Seeing his agitation, the Queen quickly soothed him, “That’s not what I meant. It’s just that you slept with my sister the night before last, you know? This punishment cancels out your merits. If you want forging techniques, you’ll have to offer something else.” 
Her sister? 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but think of the blonde loli he met at the tavern. 
He retorted, “With a clear conscience, Your Majesty, please don’t accuse me falsely. When I was drunk, it was clearly your sister who took advantage of me…” 
“A clear conscience? I don’t know where a conscience is. Why don’t you help me find it?” 
The Queen tilted her head, her hazy eyes seemingly emitting electric currents as they connected with Lin Tian. 
This behavior left Lin Tian completely baffled. “Are you serious?” 
Though he was never short of romantic encounters—after all, there were plenty of females in the tribe—he never expected to have such luck now. 
Hadn’t they just met? 
Moreover, she held a high position, having lived a pampered life for so long. Why would she start flirting with him right away? 
“Whether I’m serious or not, why don’t you feel my conscience and see?” 
Seeing Lin Tian’s hesitation, the Queen directly grabbed his hand, placing it over her “conscience.” 
A tingling sensation, like an electric shock, spread through Lin Tian’s entire body. 
It was indeed her conscience, and it felt incredibly genuine! 
This F-cup loli was truly one in a million. 
However, to be safe, Lin Tian bluntly asked, “Your Majesty, you’re not trying to set me up, are you? If you don’t explain clearly, I won’t dare to act rashly.” 
“Would you dare to act rashly if I explained clearly? So bold, not respecting me as the Queen?” 
The Queen deliberately provoked him. 
Suddenly covering her face with a smile, she began to explain, “My sister said you’re the most manly dwarf in the kingdom’s history, unmatched by anyone. I’ve been alone for nearly ten years and really want to see if what she said is true.” 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian finally understood. 
Dwarves were notoriously small in certain areas, so it made sense. 
But he asked, “Alone? Aren’t you the Queen?” 
“Hmph, the King is old, with most of his teeth gone, barely hanging on. He wasn’t that old, but he was promiscuous in his youth.” 
The Queen spoke with a forlorn expression, looking at her fingers. “If it weren’t for him being with me, I wouldn’t know how to survive…” 
“This…” 
Before Lin Tian could say anything more, the Queen pulled him into her embrace and kissed him. 
Feeling her fragrant tongue, Lin Tian couldn’t restrain himself. 
He settled the matter right then and there. 
(Ding, health increased by 240, attack increased by 100, defense increased by 100) 
After a long while. 
Seeing the Queen on the ground, her clothes in disarray and unable to get up, Lin Tian asked, “Can you teach me forging techniques now?” 
The Queen’s mind was still floating, unable to speak for the moment. 
She had gone too high. 
“Your Majesty, the King… he can’t hold on any longer!” 
At this moment, the door was pushed open, and a dwarf guard rushed in anxiously. 
Seeing the weakened, disheveled Queen on the ground, he was dumbfounded! 
His mouth opened wide. “What… what happened here?!” 
Upon hearing this, the Queen struggled to stand, tidying her clothes. “Nothing, he resolved the ghoul problem for the kingdom. I had to reward him.” 
“Reward…” 
The guard caught a glimpse of the Queen’s body curves, and his nose started bleeding uncontrollably. 
Shaking his head, he remembered the urgent matter. “The King can’t hold on any longer. Please come quickly.” 
“Really? Today is truly a double blessing.” 
After tidying up, the Queen prepared to leave. 
Lin Tian, still in a daze, said, “I’ll head back to the guild first. I’ll come find you later.” 
However, the Queen grabbed his hand, her eyes seductive as she said, “You’re coming with me. From now on, the palace is your home. I am the King, and you are the Queen, understood?” 
“What the…?” 
Lin Tian was stunned. How had he become the Queen? 
Was this happiness or bliss? 
It seemed to be both. 
This way, he could rightfully learn the top-tier forging techniques of the Dwarf Kingdom! 
It was definitely a huge gain! 
Initially, he thought this place was heaven, and now he was sure—it was heaven indeed! 
When they reached the King’s palace, he had already passed. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but gasp, “Hiss! This…” 
The figure on the bed wasn’t just a recently deceased person; it was a mummified corpse. 
With blackened eyes and withered hands. 
Even his lips were white. 
“Don’t look at me like that. When he forcibly married me ten years ago, he was already impotent. Otherwise, why would I approach you directly in the Sanctuary…” 
The Queen said, unable to hide her joy on her face. 
Today was indeed a double blessing for her. 
And for Lin Tian as well. 
“I need to handle the coronation ceremony in the next two days. Feel free to explore the palace, but stay with me at night.” 
Queen Adele said with a wicked smile. 
Lin Tian nodded, “Yes, Your Majesty.” 
Suddenly, Adele gently placed her jade-like hand over Lin Tian’s lips. “Still calling me Your Majesty? Call me dear~.” 
Lin Tian felt a bit awkward, but calling her “dear” was definitely worth it. 
The Dwarf Kingdom’s magical tools would all be his.
