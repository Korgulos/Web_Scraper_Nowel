Chapter 226: One Person ‘Annihilates’ Twenty Million Demon Insects 
TL: Sungmin  
In the rural areas of the Goblin Empire. 
A small village, where the faint smoke from cooking fires drifted into the sky and the crowing of roosters and barking of dogs filled the air. 
At the village entrance, a few children were riding wooden horses, pretending to be knights playing a game. 
Suddenly, one of the children turned his head, raised a wooden stick high, and shouted, “Knights, charge! Defeat the evil Demon King!” 
“Charge!” 
Seven or eight children rushed out of the village, pretending to ‘slay’ their enemy. 
In the distance, a two-meter-tall skeletal figure, despite wearing simple rough cloth, exuded an imposing aura as she approached the village. 
The monster the children spoke of was her. 
Veronica. 
“Stop fooling around, or I might really eat you up later!”  
Veronica joked, feeling a bit trapped by the playful siege of children. 
Surrounded by them, she couldn’t move forward. 
Hearing her words, the children feigned fear, mounted their wooden horses, and fled back into the village, shouting, “The skeleton monster is going to eat us! Run!” 
“Lady Veronica, playing with the children again, I see?” 
Rebecca descended slowly from the sky, speaking softly. 
As she landed, her eyes lit up. “Wow, the cucumbers and eggplants are growing so well this year! Amazing! I love how big these fruits are!” 
Veronica quickly pulled her hand back, protecting the vegetables from being snatched. She snorted, “These are for today’s meal. Behave yourself.” 
“Hmph, stingy.” Rebecca pouted. 
The two of them linked arms and began walking back toward the village. 
After just a few steps, the children returned, now armed with specially-made wooden swords. “Look, it’s a demon! Knights, don’t let them get away today!” 
They charged forward again. 
“These brats are really annoying,” Rebecca muttered irritably, still upset about not getting the vegetables. 
As she walked, the children’s eyes followed her every movement. 
Drooling, their gazes seemed as if they could pierce through her. 
They looked like they could devour her with their eyes. 
“Rebecca, I’ll do anything for you! As long as you can stay with me…” 
“Get lost! Rebecca belongs to me!” 
“I want to have children with Rebecca!” 
As the kids argued amongst themselves, Rebecca covered her face and chuckled. “A bunch of little insects, daring to set their sights on me? Do you even know your own weight or size?” 
“Go clean up the area in front of me.” 
With just that one command, the children obediently began cleaning the village grounds, making everything spotless. 
Veronica couldn’t help but say, “Enough already, these kids are growing up too fast because of you.” 
“What’s that got to do with me? They’re all a bunch of little perverts anyway,” Rebecca grumbled. 
Veronica retorted, “Do you really think it’s the kids’ fault? Whenever you step out, none of the men in the village even eat anymore, afraid they’ll miss a single glimpse of you.” 
As she spoke, every man in the surrounding wooden houses had their eyes wide open, staring intently. 
“Alright, you should come out less. Let’s go home and cook dinner,” Veronica added. 
The two returned to the wooden house at the edge of the village. 
At that moment, the village grew lively again. 
A Goblin Overlord, riding a carnivorous horse, arrived to deliver a message. “From now on, the gold reward for each Goblin soldier you produce will be doubled!” 
“Double?! That’s fantastic! Long live His Majesty the Goblin Emperor!” 
“You’ve got to be kidding! Such a great deal!” 
“I barely spend all the money I make in a year, and now it’s going to double—ha ha ha!” 
The villagers were ecstatic. 
Especially the men, as having more money meant they could go spend it in the Succubus House in town! 
If they couldn’t have Rebecca, they could at least indulge there. 
At that moment, the village elder couldn’t help but ask, “Lord Goblin, what’s going on? Doubling the gold reward seems rather sudden.” 
“To tell you the truth, the boss is currently trapped in the Zerg Empire, so we need to increase the number of Goblin soldiers significantly to declare war on the Zerg Empire and rescue the boss!” 
The Overlord Goblin finished speaking and swiftly rode off. 
He still had other villages to report to. 
The villagers’ faces grew serious. “Damn it! Wife, give it all you’ve got and keep producing! Now’s the time for us to repay His Majesty!” 
One by one, without further words, they began preparing to continue breeding and raising goblins. 
If the Goblin Empire fell, they’d lose their comfortable lives. 
Among the crowd, Veronica heard the news too, her expression turning grim. 
“Lin Tian, that guy… he actually dared provoke the Zerg Empire?! This is… this is simply unbelievable…” 
She hurried back and told Rebecca the news as well. 
When Rebecca heard it, she was equally shocked. “My dear… has he gone mad? The Zerg Empire… do he even know how massive that power is? He actually dared to provoke them…” 
“He’s already gone that far. Saying anything now won’t change a thing…” Veronica said heavily, sitting at the simple dining table. Even the sight of the stir-fried vegetables couldn’t whet her appetite. 
Rebecca pleaded desperately, “Haven’t you also gained a lot of power recently? Please, save my Lin Tian!” 
“Rebecca…” Seeing her anxious expression, Veronica couldn’t help but feel a bit heartbroken. 
But this only strengthened her resolve to help Lin Tian. “I definitely will!” 
Only by doing this would there be a chance for Lin Tian to restore Rebecca. 
Over the past few months, she had been summoning heretical demonic servants, strange beings from another realm, which had greatly increased her magical capacity. 
She could now summon even more and stronger creatures. 
Originally, she had intended to defeat Lin Tian and force him to restore Rebecca. But now, it seemed as though just rescuing him would suffice. 
… 
Six months passed in a blur. 
From a bird’s-eye view, the Goblin Empire was a sight to behold. 
Countless goblin soldiers stretched out like a vast ocean, an absolutely stunning sight! 
It was almost unbelievable. 
In the mountains, by the rivers, and in the fields—goblins were everywhere! 
Thankfully, the Goblin King could control them. 
Without that, managing such a chaotic horde would have been impossible. 
On the city walls, the various demi-humans and monsters watching the scene gasped in shock! 
“My god, creating an army of over a hundred million in just six months… I never imagined goblins could be this strong!!!” 
“Tch, even if they’re just cannon fodder, they could still drown a Great Empire with sheer numbers!” 
“It’s not the goblins that are strong, but the Goblin King and his subordinates…” 
“Who knows, maybe they really can defeat the Zerg Empire.” 
… 
Alice stood at the front of the massive army, her cape billowing in the wind, looking valiant. “Half a year… I didn’t expect we could really create an army of over a hundred million goblins.” 
“We will definitely save you, boss!” Gobu Yue said with determination. 
One-Eyed Owl teased, “Who knows? He might be enjoying himself right now. If we show up and mess things up, he might throw a fit! Haha.” 
“Roar!” 
At that moment, a deafening dragon roar echoed from the sky. 
Everyone looked up and saw a fiery spark streaking across the sky like a meteor! 
Trailing behind was a black meteor! 
It was none other than Little Black and Spark. 
Behind them came the Flame Dragon Mother and the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, along with other ancient dragons. 
Their presence was terrifying. 
One-Eyed Owl’s eyes lit up with excitement. “The dragons are here too! What about that old guy who loves drinking?” 
On the opposite horizon, across from the ancient dragons, a massive creature appeared, blocking out the sun! 
The entire Goblin City plunged into darkness. 
Everyone’s expressions changed drastically. “What is that monster?!” 
A massive 3,000-meter-long airship was slowly moving through the sky. 
It looked somewhat like a pirate ship. 
But beneath its hull, there were thousands upon thousands of jet-propelled magical engines! 
The Dwarves had spent the past six months pouring all their effort into constructing this ship. 
They named it the ‘Sky Beast.’ 
“Hahaha! Alice! Elizabeth! Gobu Kuang brothers! Scared silly yet? This is the masterpiece of the Dwarves!” Bill’s voice rang out from the deck. 
He suddenly jumped down, deploying a parachute and slowly descending in front of the group. 
Sara couldn’t help but ask, “Master Bill, what’s the purpose of this airship?” 
“The purpose? It’s simple. This ship can carry thousands of tons of cargo. We just need to keep dropping bombs, and boom! Those bugs will be blown to bits!” Bill said proudly. 
Seizing air superiority was a strategy they had learned from the dragons. 
With this, they could annihilate vast numbers of enemy troops. 
The Zerg Empire, with its overwhelming numbers, was the perfect target. 
Gobu Yue’s eyes were wide with amazement. “Wow, the Dwarves are incredible. With your help, boss will definitely come back!” 
“Then let’s go. It’ll take the army half a month to reach them.” Alice immediately gave the order. 
Gobu Yue nodded, “Lia and I have already arranged the supply troops.” 
“The healing corps is ready as well,” Katheryn said firmly. 
Behind her stood Ifreya and the goblin healer army, which had been hastily trained. 
They could use ‘physical magic,’ which essentially involved hurling healing potions at their allies. 
The army set out! 
It was a grand and magnificent sight! 
Thankfully, they had already united the land. Otherwise, any other empire that saw this army would be scared to death! 
They’d surrender on the spot. 
With an army of over a hundred million goblins, they could crush every empire in their path. 
However… 
With so many goblins, resources would be strained. Food shortages would mean that 99% of them would die. 
Even if they survived the battle against the Zerg Empire, they’d only starve afterward. 
… 
The Zerg Empire. 
It looked the same as always. 
But deep within the Ant Tribe’s palace… 
The Ant Queen had been continuously producing offspring for the past six months, giving birth to over ten million new hybrid ants. 
All of them were soldier ants. 
These soldier ants were far more powerful than their predecessors. 
Even now, she was still tirelessly producing more, completely driven by her obsession with Lin Tian. 
However, inside the Zerg Queen’s palace… 
Lin Tian had already become the Zerg Queen’s object of obsession. 
His body was as thin as a stick, emaciated beyond recognition. 
He lay in the arms of the Zerg Queen’s true form, who smiled brightly and gently stroked him. “Good… good… today, you have to keep working hard.” 
“I… I can’t do it anymore…”  
With great effort, Lin Tian raised his completely atrophied arm, struggling to speak. 
In his heart, he was on the verge of tears. Why haven’t those guys sent reinforcements yet? If they don’t come soon, I’m done for! 
Right now, his combat strength was zero. 
Yet, he had become deeply cherished by the Zerg Queen. After all, it’s true what they say—feelings grow over time. 
Seeing him like this, the Zerg Queen immediately called out, “Someone, bring the energy essence! Feed my dear some nutrition…” 
The energy essence was painstakingly gathered bit by bit by the worker insects. 
Its protein content was 6,000 times that of beef. 
It was specifically meant to serve as vital nourishment for the Zerg Queen’s reproductive process. 
But over the past six months, due to her affection for Lin Tian, she had given it all to him. As a result, no eggs had been produced by the Zerg race in half a year. 
In a way, Lin Tian had not only stalled the Zerg. 
He had essentially annihilated at least twenty million Zerg soldiers. 
The Zerg Queen’s reproduction speed was twice that of the Ant Queen’s, meaning she could have produced at least twenty million soldiers in six months.
