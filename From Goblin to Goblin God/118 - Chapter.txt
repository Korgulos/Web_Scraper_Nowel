Chapter 118: Gobu Kuang’s Evolution, Overlord Variant! 
TL: Sungmin 
Lion King City. 
From a distance of more than ten kilometers, one could already smell a pungent, bloody odor. 
Katheryn felt a pang in her heart, “Is the royal city… finished?” 
She knew Alice had led the monsters to attack the royal city and had anticipated such a scenario. 
Yet, she couldn’t blame Alice. 
Even she couldn’t bear to witness the chaos in the royal city. 
“It seems the place has already been cleared, saving me the trouble.” Lin Tian smiled with satisfaction. 
He led everyone into the city. 
Though many buildings had been damaged and debris was everywhere due to the monster attack, the overall structure was still well-preserved. 
Destroying it had no meaning; it was better to keep it for future use. 
The corpses had been devoured completely, leaving only traces of crimson blood. 
Around Lion King Square, more than a hundred thousand residents were surrounded by Gobu Kuang and other monsters. 
But they hadn’t attacked yet. 
Because Lin Tian had told Alice not to exterminate everyone. 
It wasn’t out of a sense of benevolence. 
But without the protection of the Great Tomb, they couldn’t act as recklessly as they did when they annihilated Clinforth. 
They needed to quickly become a significant protective force, or else they would be doomed if other empires decided to crusade against them. 
So, Alice had first eliminated over 10,000 people who came out immediately to denounce and insult her. 
Not a single one was left. 
The people in the square had stayed hidden in their homes or shelters from beginning to end. 
Following the scent, Lin Tian and his group quickly reached the square. 
Alice, Gobu Kuang, Gobu Tian, and others were all waiting there. 
“Messenger, you’re here. I’ve done what I needed to do. The rest is up to you.” Alice said calmly, her cold expression softening slightly. 
The suppressed emotions in her heart had eased. 
Lin Tian nodded and had just started to speak when Gobu Kuang, Gobu Tian, and Gobu Shan excitedly ran over. 
“Boss, we’ve missed you!” 
“Damn, Boss, you’ve seized a lot of treasures, even captured that bone thing?! That’s so weird!” 
“What do you know? After playing for a while, one naturally starts liking the strange stuff.” 
The three mumbled among themselves. 
Lin Tian gave each of them a bump on the head. “Behave. Veronica, these are your followers, right? Do you want them to come rescue you?” 
“Hmph, even Alice is here. Do you think they have the ability to rescue me?” 
Veronica looked at him as if he were an idiot and replied irritably. 
Then she ordered, “I’m already a prisoner now. From now on, listen to this goblin. Of course, you can resist if you want.” 
The Cerberus, Minotaurs, and others were stunned. 
They dared not resist. 
Lin Tian signaled Alice, Gobu Tian, and the others with his eyes. 
Then he walked towards a Minotaur, “Not bad strength, 5,000.” 
“These are followers who have been with me for decades, even centuries. You say…” 
Before Veronica could finish her sentence, Lin Tian pulled out the Spear of Zeus and instantly pierced the Minotaur’s heart, then summoned divine lightning to strike down! 
Turning it into charred remains. 
“What are you doing!” Veronica’s expression changed dramatically. 
Beside her, Alice did a backflip, gracefully leaping seven to eight meters onto the Cerberus’s head. 
The Ominous Blade slashed down fiercely. 
One head fell. 
Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan also took out world-class magical tools, effectively destroying another head. 
For the final head, Gobu Kuang and Lia attacked together, blowing it up on the spot. 
The Cerberus, known as the immortal beast from hell, was thus instantly killed. 
All three heads had to be destroyed simultaneously, or it would never die; the fallen heads would regenerate into a new three-headed body. 
The other minions from the Great Tomb were also quickly eliminated under concentrated fire. 
Veronica’s face was grim as she understood why Lin Tian did this, “You’re ruthless, Lin Tian… don’t let me catch you. I won’t kill you; I’ll make you wish for death!” 
“One must always be cautious. They are your followers; what if they rescue you while I sleep?” 
Lin Tian wiped the blood off the Spear of Zeus and said. 
He wasn’t foolish enough to leave these beings alive. 
Then he gestured to Gobu Kuang and the others, “You guys are about to evolve into overlord variants. Eat these corpses.” 
In the future, resources for upgrading would become increasingly scarce. 
They would have to see if they could cultivate ice elves in large quantities in the snowfield to produce snow crystals. 
Not every goblin could develop in a resource-rich place like the Great Tomb. 
In normal areas, it was hard to even see monsters, relying only on eating beasts and mating with low-level animals. 
They would never progress. 
Thus, they were recognized on the continent as one of the weakest and most pathetic monsters. 
Lin Tian had gathered the right time, place, and people to achieve his current tribe size. 
Though it was still just a few thousand goblins. 
“Let Gobu Kuang eat. I’m waiting to eat better stuff with the boss in the future, hehe.” Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan said disdainfully. 
They no longer had an appetite for these monsters. 
Gobu Kuang retorted, “Idiots, once my strength increases, I’ll just catch better food myself. No need to trouble the boss, and I’ll even help him catch some!” 
With that, he buried his head and started devouring. 
“Not bad, not bad. You two should learn from his awareness. Seriously…” Lin Tian also spoke in an annoyed tone. 
Soon, Gobu Kuang had devoured all the corpses of the Great Tomb followers. 
His level rose to eighty. 
He began to evolve into an overlord variant!

“A troll?!” 
At this moment, Goblin Slayer couldn’t help but exclaim. 
Gobu Kuang’s body had now grown to nearly five meters, his face full of ferocity. 
He had four muscular arms with black spikes around the joints, and his skin had become coarse and tough. 
He also had hair like seaweed, hanging over his face. 
His eyes were terrifyingly wide open like those of a top predator. 
The two demonic hands on his back spread their five fingers, previously holding a blue flame, now turned dark purple. 
He looked even more menacing. 
He completely resembled a troll. 
Trolls were a term for monsters that reached a certain level of strength and size—gigantic, powerful monsters. 
Veronica was also astonished, “A goblin can turn into a troll? And it’s an overlord variant! This is unbelievable…” 
Generally, monsters that could evolve into trolls were from strong races. 
Like minotaurs, cyclops, magical beasts, and so on. 
There had never been any record of a goblin transforming into a troll, this was a first. 
“Boss, I feel like I can catch any girl you want for you, hahaha!” 
Gobu Kuang said excitedly, feeling the immense power in his body. 
Lin Tian was very pleased with his massive improvement. “Forget about the girls for now, let’s take care of business first.” 
He then walked to the highest point in the square and observed the tens of thousands of residents of the royal city. 
He found them all terrified, with the cries of children and the anxious sighs of adults painting a picture of despair. 
“Lady Alice, I didn’t insult you. I’ve always remained neutral!” 
“Enough, stop crying. We all deserve this. Silent good people are complicit in evil! We are the culprits for her becoming like this!” 
“If only we had stopped those evil knights back then.” 
“I truly regret it, Lady Alice. Please, return to your kind self.” 
The residents cried out in desperation. 
Lin Tian cleared his throat and emitted a piercing, sinister voice, “Silence!” 
Instantly, the residents shuddered in fear and dared not speak. 
They all stared at Lin Tian. 
At first glance, they felt doomed. 
What was that? A goblin! 
A symbol of bloodthirsty slaughter and lascivious desires. 
Lin Tian then pondered, “Don’t panic or be afraid. I won’t kill you. On the contrary, I will let you live and even provide you with a more abundant life than before.” 
No one believed these words, not for a second. 
“You see how kind I look. I wouldn’t lie to you.” 
Lin Tian tried his best to look harmless as he spoke. 
Among the residents, a brave middle-aged man stood up, “Why should we believe you?” 
Anyway, they were as good as dead now. 
Seeing their skeptical expressions, Lin Tian knew words were useless. He decided to reveal the truth directly. 
He didn’t want to waste any more time. 
“I want to build an empire, so I need your help to prevent other empires from annexing us. It’s that simple.” Lin Tian explained. 
The middle-aged man quickly understood, “I see. Then why keep us here? Do you want to be our king? A king isn’t crowned by force; it requires the people’s support, you know?” 
Immediately, several young men stepped forward. 
This was a chance to gain a position, so they seized the opportunity to show their abilities. 
“That’s right, if we don’t cooperate with you, with just a few thousand goblins, you won’t be able to develop an empire.” 
“I’ve been hungry for days, give me food and water!” 
“A monster is still a monster, don’t you understand support? If people aren’t happy, you can’t be king, let alone build an empire!” 
In Western culture, a king isn’t just a founder. 
Primarily, a king relies on the support of the people. 
Otherwise, even if you call yourself king, the residents will support other nobles to usurp the throne. 
That’s why Charles II protected his subjects so well. Alice was like a tool, tirelessly helping to rescue the people. 
Of course, this was under certain conditions. If the ruler was a tyrant or a schemer, public support wouldn’t matter. 
The nobles and trusted aides, well-trained to obey, wouldn’t dare to seize power. 
If residents dared to utter a word of dissent, they would be executed on the spot. 
Coincidentally. 
Lin Tian intended to be such a tyrant. 
Watching the residents’ increasingly excessive demands, his expression darkened. 
He walked directly to the middle-aged man. 
“What are you trying to do? Kill me? I tell you, killing me now means burying your empire dream. If you have the guts, go ahead and kill me!” The middle-aged man said confidently. 
His face was full of smugness, thinking he had some understanding of power dynamics. 
Indeed. 
For a normal person, they wouldn’t dare to touch him, fearing it would incite rebellion among the other residents. 
But Lin Tian wasn’t normal. 
He directly reached out his claw and swiped. 
“You!” 
The middle-aged man stared in disbelief at his chest! 
He was gutted on the spot! 
His intestines spilled out. 
His still-beating red heart could be seen! 
“Ahh! I’m going to die!!!” 
The middle-aged man trembled all over in fear, stumbled to the ground, and screamed in terror. 
No matter how frantically he tried to stuff his organs back in, it was useless. 
The blood flowed more and more. 
Eventually, he died miserably on the spot. 
The few young men who had been shouting earlier quickly retreated into the crowd of residents in fear. 
Lin Tian took out the Spear of Zeus and summoned lightning, “Boom!” 
He electrocuted hundreds of people, including those young men! 
The smell of charred flesh filled the air, along with the horrifying death of the middle-aged man. 
This terrified the remaining residents into silence, making them shiver with fear. 
Lin Tian looked at them coldly, “I almost forgot to tell you, I aim to be a king, and I intend to be a tyrant from the start. Kekeke…” 
“We… we know we were wrong. Please, don’t kill us,” a woman pleaded. 
Indeed, they had grown too comfortable under the benevolent rule of Charles II, always daring to make demands of the king. 
They had almost forgotten that the being before them was a monster! 
Lin Tian gave a sinister smile, “Come here.” 
The woman trembled as she walked to Lin Tian and crouched down. 
Through her collar, one could see her snow-white, rapidly heaving chest. 
A faint fragrance wafted from her. 
It was clear she was utterly terrified. 
“What a lovely face, those freckles kissed by an angel, just right,” Lin Tian said, lifting her chin to admire her. 
The woman gulped hard, so scared she could barely swallow. 
She breathed through her nose, unsure of how to speak, “If… if you like, I… I can accompany you…”
