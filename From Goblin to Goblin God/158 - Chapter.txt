Chapter 158: The Descent of the Evil God! The Black Goat Mother Goddess! 
TL: Sungmin 
Note: Terminology change—Super Empire changed to Great Empire. 
“Gobu Kuang, you guys help me capture that creature! And whatever you do, don’t look it in the eyes!” Alice shouted urgently. 
On the city wall, Gobu Kuang lifted his head, his mouth full of blood, chewing on the sweet flesh. 
Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan quickly rushed over. 
They cautiously watched the severed yet still lively Child of the Evil God. 
Even the monsters found this bizarre! 
Such an abnormal level of vitality couldn’t be described as anything living. 
Gobu Kuang, astonished, quickly averted his gaze. “This feeling is much stronger than with those previous Black Goat Spawn!” 
The mental pollution was extremely intense. 
Ignoring everything else, the group began to surround and block the creature. 
But they soon discovered that no matter what they did, they couldn’t capture the Child of the Evil God. 
Poison couldn’t stun it, and ropes couldn’t bind it. 
Once its body reconnected and healed, its strength was formidable. 
At this moment, Sylph, who had just established a bond with Alice, spoke up, “To capture an anomaly like this, you’ll need a magic seal. Let me handle it.” 
“Hold that thing down!” 
Hearing this, Gobu Kuang and the others forcibly pinned it down. 
The Child of the Evil God struggled frantically, baring his fangs with a fierce snarl. “Let go of me!” 
Sylph’s figure slowly materialized, lightly tapping the void to conjure a magic circle. “Wind Magic · Binding Wind of the Valley of the Dead!” 
“I won’t be sealed!” 
The Child of the Evil God struggled violently, breaking free from the restraints in an instant. 
It began to dig into the ground, disappearing without a trace in a flash. 
Sylph cursed inwardly, “Damn, we can’t let that anomaly escape! Quick, pursue it!” 
“But, but where do we chase it!?” 
Gobu Kuang was at a loss, unable to find a direction. 
Suddenly, Gobu Tian used his X-ray vision, carefully scanning the underground. “I see him! He’s heading toward the city!” 
“Let’s go!” 
Everyone hurriedly gave chase. 
Inside the city, the battle raged on, the slaughter relentless. 
But Alice prioritized the Child of the Evil God, as Lin Tian had instructed. 
Besides, victory in the war was only a matter of time. 
Standing atop the tall city wall, Alice inquired, “How about now? Where is he?” 
“Strange, I can’t find him. He’s likely too deep underground, beyond the reach of my X-ray vision.” 
Gobu Tian responded. 
This city was several times larger than Lion King City. 
The population exceeded a million. 
Finding him could take forever. 
Nevertheless, they had to keep searching. 
… 
Time passed. 
Several days had gone by, with imperial soldiers either dead or surrendering. 
The captives were temporarily detained, awaiting Lin Tian’s return for further orders. 
But something peculiar caught Gobu Shan’s attention. “Lady Alice, it’s been so long, why haven’t we seen many residents? Our people are guarding all around; it’s impossible for a large number of residents to have escaped.” 
“Hmm?” 
In an instant, Alice sensed something was wrong, her expression changing immediately. 
In a panic, she said, “Damn, that creature must have gone to the shelter!” 
“W-What!?” 
Gobu Kuang reacted, realizing the possibility. 
If he devoured all the shelter’s residents, what kind of terrifying monster would he become? 
He grabbed an imperial resident and demanded, “Tell me, where is your shelter?” 
However, the soldier, filled with rage and desperation, spat out, “I will never tell you!” 
In his mind, Gobu Kuang and his comrades were going to slaughter the residents. 
This enraged Gobu Kuang, who flung him hundreds of meters away in a single throw. 
Just when they were at a loss, a deafening rumble echoed across the earth! 
Something was emerging in the center of the city! 
A massive, pitch-black body, covered in numerous eerie and unsettling eyes, with a face as terrifying and grotesque as a goblin’s. 
It stood at least a hundred meters tall, blotting out the sky! 
Eight arms wrapped around its entire body, with sharp, deadly claws. 
And atop its head, a pair of black horns. 
There was no doubt—it was the missing Child of the Evil God! 
“Lady Alice, i-is that him?” 
Gobu Kuang gulped, speaking with a tremor in his voice. 
But just one glance caused his entire being to be locked onto by those giant, grotesque eyes. 
A severe pain surged into Gobu Kuang’s mind. 
He collapsed, writhing on the ground. 
His sanity nearly hit zero. 
Alice quickly averted her gaze. “How could he have grown so huge!?” 
Everyone was so shocked by the scene before them that they were rendered speechless, and after staring for too long, they began to clutch their heads and struggle. 
Mental breakdown! 
They couldn’t look at it—this was the terrifying power of the anomaly. 
“That’s where the shelter is located! Damn it!” 
“What the hell is this cursed monster? Could it be that it has devoured all the residents in the shelter…!” 
“Arghhh! Fight to the death!” 
The tens of thousands of imperial soldiers who were surrounded shouted desperately. 
They charged recklessly at the Child of the Evil God. 
After all, the people in that shelter were their parents, relatives, wives, and children. 
Now, with nothing left to lose, clinging to life any longer would dishonor the title of Imperial Soldier! 
Even Gobu Kuang and his comrades, who were filled with fear, pulled back to a safer distance. But these insignificant humans continued to charge forward without hesitation! 
The Child of the Evil God looked down upon the ‘ants’ at its feet with disdain. With a light stomp, the shockwave alone knocked people unconscious. 
Yet the relentless battle cries and shouts continued unabated! 
“For the final glory of the Kingdom of the Sword!” 
“Give me back my child’s life!” 
“You monster, I’ll never forgive you! Even if I die, I’ll return as a ghost to curse you!” 
Many soldiers hadn’t even gotten close before collapsing in agony! 
They cried out with clenched teeth, their eyes bulging, bloodshot! 
Veins bulged on their foreheads and necks, their minds completely shattered, leaving them no different from the dead. 
The Child of the Evil God grinned triumphantly as countless tiny tendrils emerged from its body, seizing the soldiers. 
It devoured them cleanly. 
“Kekekeke, I need more nourishment!” 
Without exerting any effort, it turned over thirty thousand brave and fearless imperial soldiers into its nourishment. 
Seeing this, even Alice felt a pang of fear in her heart. “We should retreat; there’s no way to capture that thing anymore.” 
Hearing this, Gobu Kuang shouted, “Fall back! We’re retreating!” 
As the goblin army began to flee the city, a dense mass of pale white figures blocked their path ahead. 
It was the Undead Legion from earlier. 
The legion leader, Lawrence, snarled angrily, “Where’s that goblin? How dare they attack the Kingdom of the Sword without informing me! I’ll kill them!” 
Behind him, the over two hundred thousand strong Undead Legion glared with eyes full of resentment. 
Their very presence was terrifying. 
Alice frowned slightly and explained, “This isn’t about attacking the Kingdom of the Sword anymore. We can’t defeat that anomaly; we need to leave.” 
Lawrence looked back. 
With just one glance, he spotted the towering figure of the Child of the Evil God. 
Even as an undead, he couldn’t help but be shocked. “That’s…” 
“Keep charging! Our will won’t be so easily crushed! Avenge our loved ones!” 
A soldier captain, with blood streaming from his eyes, snarled. 
Despite being defeated by the goblin army, he knew that war was inevitable, and defeat was normal. 
But this anomalous creature before him was the one who had slaughtered his entire family. 
Compared to the goblins, he hated this creature even more. 
Lawrence stared from afar. “That’s… the shelter?!” 
Suddenly! 
Even without a heartbeat, he felt a shudder. 
Though he was dead, his family was still alive. 
In an instant, his face twisted into a demonic expression. “Undead Legion! Charge with me!” 
“Kill!” 
The deafening battle cry was so intense that even the Child of the Evil God was startled. 
The Undead Legion surged forward in a mighty charge! 
As Lawrence rushed past the soldier captain, the captain’s expression changed. “L-Lawrence?!” 
Morale, on the verge of collapse, was reawakened by the presence of a familiar soul! 
Without hesitation, he charged at the Child of the Evil God, drawing his elemental sword and stabbing fiercely! 
One of the creature’s eyes was pierced, emitting thick black smoke. 
But unfortunately… 
Within the deflated eye, familiar human faces appeared, wailing in despair, “Fleis, come with us…” 
These ghastly faces belonged to those devoured by the Child of the Evil God. 
A hand reached out, dragging Fleis inside, impossible to resist. 
Until he was completely consumed. 
Human willpower, in the end, couldn’t triumph over the anomaly. 
But Lawrence and the Undead Legion were different. They were already undead, their will was nonexistent, unbound by any constraints! 
They only sought revenge against Edward and the others. 
They were purely embodiments of vengeance, making them immune to the influence of the Child of the Evil God or any powerful anomaly. 
And physical attacks couldn’t harm the undead. 
Riding a skeletal warhorse, Lawrence charged headlong, slicing through the black tendrils, and climbed the Child of the Evil God’s leg at a 90-degree angle! 
At the same time, the other undead soldiers did the same. 
The pale legion seemed to engulf the Child of the Evil God. 
From a distance, it looked as if the undead army was spreading from its feet up to its legs, waist, and even its neck! 
Until the entire body was submerged! 
With each attack, the Child of the Evil God howled in agony, emitting an ear-piercing wail. 
This sound had a strange effect, driving people to madness! 
From afar, Alice shouted urgently, “Cover your ears!” 
But now, they could finally look directly at the Child of the Evil God. 
Nearly his entire body was engulfed by the undead army! 
“I won’t dare anymore! Stop hitting me, it hurts so much! Save me! Father, Mother!” The Child of the Evil God cried out in agony. 
Hearing this, Alice was somewhat surprised. “Father, Mother? Didn’t the messenger say he didn’t acknowledge any blood ties?” 
However, she suddenly recalled something. 
Perhaps, like the goblins, intelligence needed to be devoured and upgraded to improve. 
It was clear that the Child of the Evil God had now grown to a very powerful level. 
At that moment, the undead army seemed to disperse, falling to the ground one after another. 
But it was because the Child of the Evil God could no longer bear it and forcibly reverted to his Goblin form. 
He ran away in pain. 
“Father, Mother, someone save me!”  
The Child of the Evil God, covered in blood, cried out as he ran, desperately seeking an escape. 
But no place offered refuge. 
Digging tunnels was futile—the undead could move through the earth as they pleased. 
Flying was not an option for him. 
Just then, the previously clear sky suddenly darkened. 
An unprecedented sense of oppression formed between heaven and earth! 
This was far more intense than the earlier standoff. 
Now, it felt as if someone was pressing down on you, as if something was gripping your soul and sending a powerful message: 
Flee! Or face death! 
Even the undead army, which had been driven solely by the desire for revenge, couldn’t help but feel fear. 
The Child of the Evil God, however, was overwhelmed with emotion. “Is it… Is it Father? Mother? Please, save me!” 
… 
In the chapter, the undead army/legion’s leader was called Klaus. However, he was previously called Lawrence so I’ll use that name, especially since he’s a minor character.
