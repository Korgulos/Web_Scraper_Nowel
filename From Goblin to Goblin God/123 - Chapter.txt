Chapter 123: Dragon Crystals, Dragon Slayer Guild! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Father, a birdman came asking for my help, saying you were in danger. I didn’t expect there would really be ants daring to cause you trouble.” As Little Black spoke, he cast a fierce and venomous gaze over the hundreds of thousands of troops. 
The ground shook as he paced the city walls! 
The soldiers were so terrified that their courage nearly shattered. 
“What! Father?!?!” Upon hearing this, Edward was stunned. 
This was a goblin? Could goblins actually have relations with ancient dragons? 
The world had changed! 
Veronica also realized, “Could this guy be the god the black witch mentioned? No way, how could a goblin become a god, Alice? Katheryn? But they were all so ordinary…” 
The more she thought about it, the more frightened she became. 
If this goblin continued to grow, she might not be able to defeat him even if she escaped. 
Just the dragons in front of her were not something to be trifled with. 
“Isn’t that Scar? The dragon our allied forces fought nine years ago!” Suddenly, Gilbert recalled. 
Alice was slightly surprised and turned her head, “The dragon is actually on our side now. As expected of the messenger.” 
The top forces from various empires had once joined forces to hunt Scar. 
The battle had been deadly. 
But they had managed to subdue Scar. 
Now, to see him here, even stronger! 
Edward looked at the white dragon surrounded by lightning, his expression heavy, “Just Scar and that thousand-meter-long unknown dragon are hard enough to deal with, and now the legendary Thunder Calamity, which killed millions seventy years ago, has appeared too…” 
“What kind of goblin is this!” 
Wherever Thunder Calamity went, unimaginable thunderstorms and heavy rains followed. 
The random lightning strikes could destroy everything, and the rain could cause floods. 
Hence the name Thunder Calamity. 
Every ancient dragon was a formidable existence. 
Even Katheryn was stunned. Despite her experience with grand events, the sight of several dragons exuding a suffocating dragon aura made her soul tremble. 
It felt as though her life was constantly threatened, a single misstep could mean death at their hands. 
“Little Black, Scar, please crush these bugs for me. You’ve been holding back for so long; any trouble today is on me. Go all out!” 
Lin Tian looked down disdainfully at Edward and the others. 
The dragons, having suppressed their nature for survival, were finally free to release it and certainly wouldn’t hold back. 
Suddenly. 
Edward quickly said, “Wait, maybe we can negotiate. There’s no need for a massacre, causing unnecessary losses, right?” 
He was now completely panicked. 
It wasn’t fear for himself. 
But for the potential waste of hundreds of thousands of troops. 
Gilbert and his brother also bowed respectfully, “Lord Goblin, we know your tastes. In the future, in our Magic Kingdom, you can enjoy as many cosplay girls dressed as magic apprentices as you like!” 
Lin Tian sneered, “Do you misunderstand what unnecessary loss means? Isn’t the situation one-sided now? Besides, once you’re exterminated, won’t the Magic Kingdom be mine?” 
They had many soldiers. 
But he had none on his side. 
He just needed the dragons to slaughter their soldiers en masse, and they would be the ones suffering in the end. 
Edward and the others were drenched in sweat. 
Gilbert and his brother were almost in tears. They represented a nation. 
If they fought, twenty thousand troops would die instantly. 
Half of their national power would be gone. 
“Lord Goblin, please don’t be rash. How about I help you cool down first?” Gilbert spoke. 
He activated an extremely rare super-tier magic, ‘Shape-shifting Technique.’ 
In an instant, he turned into a youthful, beautiful magic-transforming girl. 
Her figure was entirely different from before. 
Slim and cute. 
Gilbert also transformed into a little girl. 
Edward felt utterly disgusted, “These guys are kings, how can they be so shameless?” 
If negotiations were possible, fine, but not at the cost of their dignity. 
“You guys are truly disgusting. Little Black, take action!” 
Lin Tian’s face darkened, feeling subjected to the most eye-searing torture ever! 
At least his preferences were normal. 
These shells hid revolting, burly men, both bizarre and nauseating. 
Three ancient dragons flapped their wings violently. 
They soared into the sky, stirring up massive hurricanes! 
Little Black had grown to a thousand meters in length, with a wingspan of three thousand meters! 
A true sky-covering presence! 
The three dragons circled above the hundreds of thousands of soldiers, who were now too scared to move. 
Where could they run? 
Even a thousand steps couldn’t outpace a single wing flap. 
The magical soldiers, due to the chaotic airflow, couldn’t float. Flying up only to be knocked down. 
Falling hard. 
Thirty thousand soldiers scrambled on the ground, not knowing what to do. 
The dragons circled but did not attack immediately. 
“Nidhogg, did you forget the Dragon King’s order? We can’t attack humans again, or we will face another crusade!” Scar hesitated. 
Little Black didn’t see it that way. “Now, I am protecting my father. Is there a problem with that?” 
“Scar, I said I would take responsibility for this. Even if they bring people from the Dragon Slayer Guild, I wouldn’t hesitate to help you destroy them.” Lin Tian’s expression was serious. 
As long as he targeted prey, he wouldn’t stop until it was eliminated. 
Moreover, the existence of the Dragon Slayer Guild posed a significant threat to his future control over the ancient dragon clan. 
Now, the Dragon King had likely given birth to his children. 
With Little Black added to the mix, the ancient dragon clan would be at his command in the future. 
Upon hearing this. 
Scar hesitated, then aimed below and unleashed a torrent of scorching dragon fire! 
It exploded like a missile! 
The soldiers’ screams echoed, but only those who survived could cry out. 
Those engulfed by the dragon flames didn’t even have the chance to scream! 
Over 10,000 vanished on the spot. 
Tens of thousands scattered in panic. 
Edward’s face was dark, his teeth clenched in hatred yet helpless, “Damn goblin! I won’t let you get away with this!!!” 
With that, he began to retreat with several subordinates. 
The remaining soldiers were left to their own luck. 
In this chaos, no formation could be saved; it was better to retreat than be completely annihilated. 
Gilbert and his brother joined forces, unable to watch twenty thousand soldiers perish. 
The Magic Kingdom would be severely weakened. 
“World-class magic: Hela Vine!” 
Five magic circles formed on the ground, and thick vines sprouted rapidly, reaching towards Little Black. 
Unfortunately, her massive body easily tore them apart. 
But the vines were incredibly resilient, regrowing immediately after being broken. 
Seeing this, Little Black breathed out a destructive dragon flame, withering everything it touched! All life was extinguished. 
Soldiers struggled as their flesh decayed rapidly before collapsing like dried corpses. 
“What element is this dragon?! Let’s flee, brother! We have no experience in dragon slaying; we need professionals!” 
Gilbert’s pupils shrank in fear as he cast an ultimate magic, “Shadow Tribe Boots!” 
Black boots appeared on his feet, propelling him hundreds of meters away in an instant! 
The brothers quickly caught up with Edward. 
Gilbert cursed angrily, “Your Majesty Edward, aren’t you too cowardly to still call yourself a Sword Saint?!” 
“Are you mad? Daring to face a thousand-meter-long dragon? In history, which dragon slaying didn’t involve a dozen or more top-tier fighters?” Edward retorted irritably, thinking the brothers were fools. 
The only way to settle this grudge was to find the Dragon Slayer Guild to kill the three dragons and then raise an army to take down Lion King City. 
Gilbert and his brother deeply regretted their earlier thoughts of seizing the beauties beside Lin Tian. Now, they had lost twenty thousand soldiers and failed to capture the Wind Spirit. 
Outside the city. 
Soldiers fled in despair, their king having abandoned them. 
“Damn it, Your Majesty, why didn’t you save us!” 
“Weren’t we told this would be an easy victory? Damn Edward!” 
“Damn Gilbert and Gilberts, I won’t forgive you!” 
The soldiers could only die helplessly, burned to ash! 
Their desperate cries and curses echoed continuously. 
Abandoned to die, with their commander fleeing, was more disheartening than death! 
There was nowhere to escape. 
Even running thousands of meters wouldn’t save them from the approaching flames! 
Hatred and anger grew. 
Until the battlefield was strewn with corpses, only one or two thousand soldiers escaped. 
Only then did the voices of resentment cease. 
However, 
The hatred they bore before death lingered around the royal city. 
Lin Tian could clearly feel the oppressive, eerie atmosphere, like a lingering fog. 
It enveloped Lion King City. 
“These grievances, won’t they turn them into spirits?” 
Lin Tian muttered to himself with a frown. 
For now, at least the crisis from the alliance was averted. 
And the tens of thousands of charred soldier corpses— 
They could be used as experience points! 
It was a net gain! 
Little Black and the others had slaughtered the soldiers like humans stepping on ants. 
“Father, some scattered humans escaped. Should we pursue them?” Little Black landed on the city wall and asked. 
Lin Tian waved his hand, “No need. Thank you all. What about the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother? Has her condition improved?” 
Scar spoke up, “We came to watch over Nidhogg, and also because of this.” 
“Mother is a crystal dragon, and her life source is dragon crystals. She cannot leave the World Tree. Father, can you think of a solution?” Little Black answered, visibly saddened. 
Lin Tian frowned slightly. Dragon crystals?
