Chapter 108: The Pope’s Terror, Lin Tian’s Serious Injury 
TL: Sungmin 
The cardinal finally smiled in relief, “It’s okay, Ifreya. His Holiness the Pope has taken action. We won’t lose!” 
Then, a fierce light appeared in his eyes! 
He glanced at Gobu Kuang and his group. 
“To die in the heavenly kingdom is your honor!” 
He raised his hand, ready to cast magic again. 
With the boost from Kingdom Come, dealing with them was now a piece of cake. 
He could even kill Gobu Kuang in an instant. 
Alice also felt troubled. 
“World-class Magic · Shield of Avalon!” 
Suddenly, Ifreya’s magic book flipped rapidly in her hands. 
Four magic arrays converged, emitting a blinding light toward the cardinal! 
They encased him directly in a hexagonal crystal shield. 
The cardinal was full of astonishment, “Ifreya, what are you doing? Let me out!” 
“It’s done!” 
Ifreya’s eyes were vacant, like a robot that had completed its task, and she swaggered back to Alice. 
She had never been able to use world-class magic because her level was not high enough—under level 100. 
But she was in the divine category. 
With the boost from Kingdom Come, she was granted the qualification to use it. 
Although its power was far from what a true level 100 could wield. 
It was still not something the cardinal could break through. 
Avalon was once an empire on this continent. 
Its most famous achievement was the creation of shields. Their shield-bearing troops had once achieved a legendary victory of zero casualties in the annihilation of a small nation. 
The king comprehended and created this magic. 
Later, it was learned by the Clin family. 
Allowing Ifreya to master it. 
The cardinal, unwilling to give up, punched the shield. 
After this punch, he immediately gave up resistance. 
He felt as if he had struck a towering mountain, utterly unshakeable. 
Just controlling him was enough, 
So Lin Tian left without worry. 
He disguised himself as an imperial soldier and ran to the enemy’s rear, soon seeing a hastily built altar. 
On top of it stood a figure radiating golden light, hands raised to the sky. The holy light soaring into the sky emanated from him. 
The Pope, ‘Douglas’. 
His cross holy robes fluttered without wind, and his eyes shone with a bright golden light! 
He looked like a god descending to the mortal realm. 
Majestic and divine!

“What the hell? What’s with these guys’ combat power? Just a bit more than Veronica, is it? To the point where it scared her into inaction!” Lin Tian felt both puzzled and irritated. 
He had intended to leave the rest to Veronica. 
But she hadn’t made a move after such a long wait, so he had to try it himself. 
He also wanted to gauge the Pope’s strength. 
Then he thought to himself, “Hmph, once this is over, see how I deal with you! Veronica, I’ll use your bones to make soup! And that seductive succubus too!” 
Letting him and his kin die irresponsibly like this. 
How could he not resent Veronica? 
“Your Holiness! I have something to report!” 
Lin Tian rushed up, kneeling before him and speaking anxiously. 
Feeling the holy light emanating from him, he almost couldn’t breathe, his whole body in discomfort. 
The Pope looked slightly surprised, his golden eyes fixed on Lin Tian, neither speaking nor looking away. 
It was quite unnerving. 
At this moment, a graceful nun approached gently, “Don’t be anxious, stand up and speak slowly.” 
Lin Tian’s eyes brightened at the sight of her. What was with this nun? The pristine holy robes gave him an urge to defile them. 
Good grief, good things were hidden here! 
But first, he needed to get down to business. 
With the life armor protecting him, theoretically, the Pope couldn’t kill him with a single blow. 
He just needed to wound the Pope with the Spear of Zeus stained with the Blood of Ruin. 
The possibility of this was quite high. 
So Lin Tian decided to take this risk. 
He then seriously explained the frontline situation, preparing to take out the Spear of Zeus from his space ring. 
“Move aside!” 
The old Pope lowered one hand, bursting forth a strong holy light! 
Like a cannonball, it blasted Lin Tian away at supersonic speed! 
The sound of the sonic boom could still be heard! 
The terrifying, unbelievable force sent Lin Tian flying away. 
He was thrown directly to the edge of Kingdom Come, thirty kilometers away, crashing heavily against the shield before falling to the ground. 
“My back… cough, cough…” 
On the ground, Lin Tian twisted like a worm, coughing up large amounts of blood. 
He felt like he was about to die. 
Everything hurt. 
It wasn’t just his hand that was broken; it felt like all his bones were shattered. 
The life armor on his chest had formed a thick, round shape, absorbing most of the damage. 
It had become shriveled and deflated, as if it were about to die. 
But even so, Lin Tian’s chest bones were all broken. 
He had severe internal injuries. 
His internal organs and brain seemed to be bleeding. 
“Damn, how is it this terrifying? I think I understand that Veronica now…” Lin Tian muttered. 
Just one casual attack had nearly killed him. 
No wonder only this pope survived for so long. 
He had scared the entire crypt into submission. 
Suddenly. 
The golden light before him began to dim. 
Dark clouds gathered in the sky, lightning flashed, and thunder roared, forming a massive vortex. 
Several black, giant magic arrays also appeared! 
It seemed something was about to emerge! 
The terrifying pressure made it hard for everyone to breathe! 
Then, a large, black, furry, wrinkled hand stretched out from the vortex! 
It blocked out the sky! 
The nails were pitch black, making it hard to tell if it was a humanoid creature or something else. 
It slammed heavily onto Kingdom Come. 
“Crack!” 
The deafening roar echoed as Kingdom Come was directly shattered! 
The church members had not anticipated such an event. 
The suppressed monsters regained their strength and began to counterattack! 
Lin Tian, still shaken, thought, “What kind of high-level combat is this? I don’t seem to have any qualification to compare…” 
“Thank you, little guy. We will now enter and lead your goblins to victory.” 
Behind him. 
A familiar, sinister voice spoke. 
It was Veronica, along with Rebecca. 
And behind them, a horde of fierce, terrifying monsters bared their fangs! 
Cerberus, Cyclops, Minotaurs, various monstrous beastmen, black witches, and many more! 
All incredibly powerful. 
Because of Lin Tian’s attack, though unsuccessful, it had distracted the old pope, weakening Kingdom Come. 
Veronica seized the opportunity to use her heretical summoning, calling forth the Hand of Calamity. 
Breaking it. 
Then, they prepared to enter and reap the rewards of victory. 
Lin Tian watched them leave, squinting with a cold expression. 
He thought, “What a clever plan. They seem to be guarding against me deeply, not even giving me treatment? Are they that afraid I’ll turn against them?” 
Since that was the case, they couldn’t blame him for biting back hard.
