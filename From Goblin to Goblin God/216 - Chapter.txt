Chapter 216: Pond Lotus, Rose in Hand 
TL: Sungmin  
“Welcome! Your Majesty, Goblin King!” 
All the bunny girls respectfully bowed in greeting. 
The boss lowered his head, giving a signal to everyone. 
They had been trained repeatedly to do everything they could to make Lin Tian happy. If one of them could catch Lin Tian’s eye, she would immediately become the leader of the rabbit people! 
Osius and the others, standing in the back, couldn’t help but say, “Damn, why didn’t we get this kind of treatment when we came? I’m so jealous. Look at my favorite, Little Mei, the way she’s eyeing Brother Tian, it’s practically melting!” 
“Yeah, right. Stop dreaming like a bleating sheep,” Grugia mocked. 
Lin Tian spoke calmly, “Boss, bring the wine. These gold coins will cover it.” 
With that, he placed a bag of gold coins on the bar. 
They were all familiar faces by now. 
Every time he came, everything was arranged perfectly, and Lin Tian never missed an opportunity to take advantage. 
But dining for free was too low, even for him. 
The bunny girl boss couldn’t refuse the money, though she always ensured the service and drinks were worth at least as much as the gold coins Lin Tian gave. 
She was a smart businesswoman; otherwise, her tavern wouldn’t be the most popular place in town. 
But this time, the bunny girl boss seemed a bit uneasy. “Your Majesty, this is too much. No matter how special our service is, it’s not worth this much.” 
“Are you sure?” 
Lin Tian glanced at the bunny girls. “I heard that if the price is right, there are… extra services, no? My men here are pretty tired.” 
“Ah, I see! Since you’ve mentioned it, Your Majesty, we’ll definitely arrange something! But what about you? You get to choose first!” The bunny girl boss added. 
Lin Tian paused for a moment, amused by her cleverness.  
However, he smiled. “I’ve already chosen.” 
“Already chosen?” The bunny girl boss looked puzzled, her rabbit ears drooping in confusion. 
In the crowd. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s heart skipped a beat, her gaze slightly panicked. 
She muttered to herself, “What does this bastard mean by that? Who’s he picking? I won’t lose that easily!” 
“Let’s do this!” 
At the table. 
Lin Tian and the One-Eyed Owl faced off, surrounded by onlookers, excited and egging them on. 
As the bunny girls brought barrels of strong liquor, Lin Tian couldn’t wait any longer. “Let’s get started, Big Sis! Today, I’ll make sure you lose completely!” 
“Hold on! I need someone to cheer me on first.” The One-Eyed Owl replied heavily, her eyes fixed on the door. 
At that moment. 
A short, bearded man slowly entered, his beer belly sticking out, walking with bold strides. 
It was none other than the dwarf, Master Bill. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s eyes lit up. “Master, today you must witness your apprentice’s success!” 
“Hahaha! You lot are really something. Drinking like it’s a battlefield!” Bill laughed. 
Seeing the barrels of liquor, he took a big gulp to rinse his mouth. “Now this is some interesting stuff. Boss, how come I never got to drink this before?” 
“This is our exclusive brew for His Majesty the King. Please forgive us,” the bunny girl boss replied with a forced smile. 
Bill snorted but said no more, contentedly drinking. “Apprentice, you better not embarrass me!” 
“Well now, Master Bill, are you siding against me?” Suddenly, Lin Tian’s voice darkened. 
Bill shuddered, nearly dropping his cup. “Your Majesty, how could you say that? You’re practically half my apprentice too. This is just a friendly match between fellow disciples! Hahaha!” 
“Hmph, if I lose, I’ll ban you from ever setting foot in this tavern again.” Lin Tian grumbled good-naturedly. 
Of course, it was just a joke. Bill had painstakingly rebuilt the palace and was the chief of defense. 
He had constructed many fortifications, making the Goblin King’s city impenetrable. 
He had also planned future urban development. 
In short, he was an important figure. 
But that offhand joke weighed heavily on Bill, who took it as a matter of life and death. “Apprentice, I beg you, get drunk quickly for the sake of your master’s honor! Your Majesty, let me teach you a few tricks to win this drinking contest!” 
With that, Bill leaned over and whispered into Lin Tian’s ear. “All you have to do is pour the wine from your cup into your spatial ring. Got it?” 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian couldn’t help but admire the old man’s cunning. 
He hadn’t even thought of that! 
Then again, the dwarves had forged the spatial rings. 
Bill had probably used this trick many times before in drinking competitions. 
“Master, if I lose, I won’t let you off!” 
The whole tavern grew cold as ice. 
In the One-Eyed Owl’s eyes, a deadly glint appeared. 
Bill was so terrified, he wanted to die. 
Then. 
Lin Tian urged, “Come on, Big Sis. Have a little confidence. Fill it up!” 
The bunny girls started pouring the wine. 
The contest began, with both sides taking turns, cup after cup. 
Osius gave a signal to the crowd. “Hey, Old Gru, they’re going to be at it for a while before it gets really interesting. How about we go claim the perks Brother Tian gave us first?” 
Hearing this, Grugia’s face lit up. “You really get me, man! Let’s go!” 
The two of them found the bunny girls they had their eyes on and headed upstairs. 
“Hey! What do you two think you’re doing?” 
Bill’s voice rang out, stopping them in their tracks. He cursed under his breath, “Osius, you bastard, that’s my Little Mei!” 
“Old man, these are the perks Brother Tian gave us. You were late, so don’t blame me, hahaha!” 
The two hurried upstairs, laughing. 
An hour passed quickly. 
The special brew this time was incredibly strong. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s face had turned red, as if she had eaten ten devil peppers. 
Even Lin Tian was a little surprised. “I didn’t expect you to build up such a tolerance, Big Sis.” 
This liquor was so strong that, without using his spatial ring, Lin Tian would have been drunk long ago. 
The fact that the One-Eyed Owl was still holding on impressed him. 
He couldn’t help but say, “Master Bill, I have you to thank. I’ll reward you by giving Little Mei to you as a gift. You’ve worked hard lately!” 
“Huh? Forget it, Your Majesty. Little Mei? Even dogs wouldn’t want her now. Little Fang is pretty nice, though… Maybe her?” Bill chuckled, throwing a playful look at the bunny girl, Little Mei, who was pouring drinks nearby. 
Lin Tian didn’t mind. “Alright, but you’ve got to take responsibility for her. Since I’m gifting her to you, you’ve got to make her happy.” 
“Uh…” 
The mention of making her happy seemed to deflate Bill, as if all his energy drained out. “I’ll do my best, thank you.” 
There’s a kind of pain in the world—when you have a feast right in front of you, but you can’t eat it because you no longer have the ‘teeth’ for it. 
Before long, the One-Eyed Owl started showing obvious signs of intoxication. 
But seeing Lin Tian still looking calm and steady, she couldn’t help but say, “What’s going on with you? How are you still so steady? Could it be… could it be that I’m really not as good as you? I don’t accept this! Let’s keep going!” 
“Big Sis, don’t push yourself. You’ve already lost to me.” Lin Tian spoke with heartfelt concern. 
His gaze was drawn to the One-Eyed Owl’s figure. 
Wild and bold, yet mixed with the tenderness of youth. 
It was a rare combination. 
Though he had seen her many times before, this time felt different. 
Before, it was like looking at an untouchable lotus flower in the middle of a pond. 
Now, it was like holding a rose tightly in his hand!
