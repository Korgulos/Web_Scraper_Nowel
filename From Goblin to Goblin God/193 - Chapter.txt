Chapter 193: The Dungeon Was Your Lie—Osius 
TL: Sungmin 
The members of the special Dragon Slayer Guild were left speechless. 
They stared wide-eyed at the weapon lying on the ground. 
That abundant and vast magical power, surrounded by brilliant radiance! 
It all proclaimed unmistakably that this was a world-class magic artifact!! 
“I-I didn’t see wrong, right? This is world-class? This really is world-class!!” 
Osius’s eyes widened, and he immediately crouched down on the ground. 
He wished he could crawl right into that sword. 
Grugia felt the same way, almost kneeling, “D-Do I really have a chance to use a world-class magic artifact? Big Bro Tian! No, godfather! Dad!!!” 
Osius cradled the sword as if it were a beautiful young woman, holding it with utmost care. 
He looked up at Lin Tian and said, “Actually, I didn’t lie last time in the dungeon. If you want it, Big Bro Tian, I can give it to you.” 
“Damn it, stop talking already. Just keep it yourself. In truth, these things aren’t rare for us as long as we have the materials.” 
Lin Tian’s face twisted in disgust. 
Now that even the Dwarves had joined the Goblin Empire, creating world-class magic artifacts was no longer difficult. 
Even One-Eyed Owl was somewhat tempted. 
After all, it was a world-class magic artifact, something she had never owned before. 
But when it came to fighting, she still preferred hand-to-hand combat—it felt more comfortable. 
Lin Tian searched for a while, then helplessly said, “There’s only a tenth-tier pair of gauntlets. Not many people use this kind of weapon, but it’s close enough to hand-to-hand combat, right?” 
A pair of black iron chain gauntlets lay on the ground. 
One-Eyed Owl didn’t seem too interested, “Wearing these things would be so inconvenient. I still prefer not wearing anything.” 
“Big Sis, you should take them. After all, there might be some special circumstances.” 
Osius also tried to persuade her. 
The other members of the Dragon Slayer Guild chimed in, “Everyone else has their own weapons. If Big Sis doesn’t have one, it wouldn’t be right.” 
“What’s this? Are you all no longer recognizing me as the guild leader? Fine, fine, you all consider that kid the boss now?” One-Eyed Owl’s voice was cold, her anger surging. 
The group hurriedly shook their heads and waved their hands, “How could that be? Even though Big Bro Tian is indeed awesome, it’s Big Sis’s spirit that we follow.” 
“Hmph.” 
One-Eyed Owl didn’t say anything else but did pick up the gauntlets and attached them to her belt. 
Immediately after, Lin Tian went to invite the Flame Dragon Mother and Little Black to help out when the time came. 
It would be best if they could wipe them all out in one go. 
Two days passed quickly. 
The sun blazed overhead; it was already noon. Tonight, Sara and the others would prepare to make their move. 
But for such a long time, there had been no news from the Insect Tribe. 
Finally. 
They saw an ant person with wings flying in from the sky. 
Behind him were a large number of blue insects, looking very peculiar. 
These were unique magical creatures. 
Each one was about the size of a person, their blue bodies forming a pattern like a vortex, staring at them for too long made one feel like they were getting sucked in. 
They also had a long nose, like an antenna. 
The ant person reached the palace and landed lightly, reporting, “Your Majesty, the Phantom Worms have arrived, but our Queen has a request. It was she who convinced the Phantom Worm Tribe.” 
Looking at the group of Phantom Worms behind him, there were about a few hundred of them, which was more than enough. 
Each projected image could be seen by hundreds or thousands of people. 
Then, one would spread to ten, ten to a hundred. 
Soon, the entire Troy Empire would know. 
“What’s the request?” Lin Tian asked. 
Immediately, behind the ant person, there timidly stood a small ant person, with big eyes curiously observing the surroundings, appearing very scared and timid. 
The ant person solemnly said, “We hope that you can provide us with a hybrid ant tribe.” 
A hybrid ant tribe? 
Lin Tian frowned slightly, sensing that this request had ulterior motives. 
He replied nonchalantly, “No problem. I’ll arrange for a Goblin to breed with this ant person.” 
However, the ant person shook his head, “No, the Queen wants a hybrid ant tribe bred by you.” 
Their goal was Lin Tian’s genes. 
After investigating the Goblins born from Fiona, Katherina, Little Black, and others, they had learned that Goblins born from Lin Tian’s genes were exceptionally strong—smarter, more ferocious, with higher aggression and predation instincts, faster growth, and superior potential. 
While other Goblins were still in the big variant category, they were already of the hero variant. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian’s expression showed a hint of hesitation. 
It seemed these guys had done quite a bit of research on him. 
But given the situation, handing over his genes was no big deal; he did that often enough anyway. 
“Alright then, but it’s getting late, so let’s finish my business first.” Lin Tian said solemnly. 
The ant person nodded without any objections. 
Then he started giving orders, “You, connect to a host body and follow me. The rest of you, infiltrate the Troy Empire and project everywhere.” 
“Huh? The Troy Empire?!” 
Upon hearing this, the numerous Phantom Worms felt a bit terrified. They hadn’t been informed beforehand that they were being sent to their deaths. 
The Troy Empire was a place from which no one could possibly return alive. 
Seeing their hesitation, the ant person coldly stated, “This is an order from your Queen. As worker bugs, do you intend to disobey?” 
With that, the Phantom Worms fell silent. 
For the Insect Tribe, obedience was ingrained from birth, along with their sense of mission and responsibility. 
Even until death. 
The Phantom Worms then connected their long antennae to form a link with the host body, leaving behind a single mother bug. The others immediately set off for the Troy Empire. 
Since they could fly, they would reach their destination by midnight. 
At that time, they would project whatever the mother bug saw, and the mission would be accomplished. 
“Now, Your Majesty, can you begin?” the ant person urged from the side. 
Lin Tian frowned, staring at him. “Are you trying to teach me how to do things?” 
Instantly, the ant person froze, then hurriedly stammered, “N-No.” 
Lin Tian got up and began walking outside, saying coldly, “You all wait here for a while. I’ll be back soon. I won’t forget the Queen’s favor.” 
There was no way he would agree to this so easily. 
He had already guessed the Insect Tribe’s true motive—they definitely intended to cultivate this hybrid ant tribe into a new Queen. 
This would lead to a qualitative leap in reproduction speed, growth rate, and combat power for the new ant tribe! 
It was terrifying to imagine what the Insect Tribe might become in the future. 
Even world domination wouldn’t be out of the question. 
He went into the city and found an ordinary low-level Goblin that looked somewhat like him. 
From now on, this low-level Goblin would be the king. 
Then, Lin Tian devoured a leader variant Goblin, using Abnormal Fusion to transform into the appearance of a leader variant. 
The two of them returned to the palace. 
The ant person quickly greeted them with respect, “Your Majesty, and Lord Gobu Kuang, you’re here.” 
“Bring that female ant person over to me,” the low-level Goblin said according to Lin Tian’s instructions. 
Lin Tian nodded and then grabbed the ant person, leading her to a room at the back of the palace. “As you command, Boss.” 
Watching the two leave, the ant person’s large eyes fixed on them, activating his ability to send insects to monitor them. “Could it be that he’s discovered our intentions?” 
In the insect’s surveillance, after watching “Lin Tian” complete the breeding process, the ant person finally relaxed. 
“Hmph, from now on, our Insect Tribe will become the strongest race! Queen, your time has come!” 
The Insect Tribe Queen was the true ruler of the Insect Tribe. 
The ant-queen was merely a duke within the Insect Tribe hierarchy. 
The ant tribe had been plotting to overthrow the Queen for a long time, and this hybrid was the most crucial step. 
That’s why they were so eager to assist Lin Tian. 
Not long after, the low-level Goblin, looking thoroughly pleased, brought the female ant person back to the main hall. “Our boss is resting now. Take her away.” 
“Please convey our deepest gratitude to His Majesty, the Goblin King. The Insect Tribe will show mercy in the future,” the ant person said, flapping his wings quickly as he left. 
“Show mercy?” 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but smirk as he reverted to his original form. “So the Insect Tribe’s ambition is this vast? They even dream of taking over the entire world?” 
However, even though it was the weakest, most useless low-level Goblin, it was still much better than an original low-level Goblin after Lin Tian’s repeated training. 
After mixing with the Insect Tribe, the offspring produced would be stronger as well. 
At least they wouldn’t be his own, or else the Insect Tribe’s power would become unstoppable. 
… 
In the district, the shops of the three great empires were operating in an orderly fashion. 
Business was booming. 
However, Sara and the others had already begun preparing for action in secret. 
They all gathered together to start their discussion. 
“I’ve decided. Tonight, I’ll make that disgusting Goblin Lin Tian pay the price!” Sara said coldly, her beautiful eyes filled with murderous intent. 
Everyone’s expressions changed, “Princess Sara, are you sure?!” 
Sara continued, “I’m sure. Tonight, I’ll invite him over, then drag him into the Troy Arena and slowly play him to death!” 
“In that case, we’re certain of victory. As expected of Princess Sara, both courageous and wise!” Luna praised. 
Zolt also spoke up, “We’ve prepared many puppets. Although they can’t attack on a large scale, they can still play a role.” 
One of the Troy heroes scoffed, “Hmph, with us taking action, that should be more than enough. You just need to follow along; you won’t miss out on anything.” 
The others remained silent, not arguing. 
Indeed, the heroes of Troy were all powerful. Since they wanted to take the spotlight, they let them. 
Luna added, “This time, we should thank Princess Sara. You’re making the biggest sacrifice and contribution. If I have the chance, I’ll definitely visit your country.” 
“It’s nothing. Just one Goblin. If it weren’t for the bigger picture, I could’ve killed him more easily. Now, just wait for my signal. Then you can all infiltrate the palace and wipe out the entire high command,” Sara instructed with determination. 
They were all full of confidence! 
Even though they had each suffered a bit, they dismissed it as mere accidents. The final victory would undoubtedly be theirs. 
Inside the Goblin Palace… 
Lin Tian was in the midst of planning how to handle the situation that night. The enemy’s average combat power was around 9,500. 
However, because of their total collapse in Persephia and the near destruction of the Giant Elephant Empire, their combat strength had significantly weakened. 
With the main forces of Alice, Little Black, the Flame Dragon Mother, and One-Eyed Owl on his side, along with the rest of his team, they were more than capable of dealing with the threat. 
Moreover, he had already set up magical traps in advance. 
Lin Tian also needed to think about how to deal with Sara when the time came.
