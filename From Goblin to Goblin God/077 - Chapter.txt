Chapter 77: The Sword of Killing 
TL: Sungmin  
“Is it her, we…”  
Clin’s expression showed a moment of relief, but then he wavered. 
Previously, Avril had declared that she would capture the Sword Saintess and give an explanation to the entire nation.  
It was a move to win the people’s hearts. 
But now, in this moment of despair, everyone rejoiced at the appearance of the Sword Saintess. 
Even Avril was internally struggling and embarrassed. “Grandfather… will she save us?” 
Clin’s old face couldn’t muster a smile as he responded in a low voice, “She should. No, she definitely will.” 
In the current situation, even he thought they were certainly doomed. 
Blocked from front and back, their army had suffered heavy casualties. 
They were being beaten by the goblins. 
“Sword Saintess, please save us!!” 
“Woo woo woo, my Sword Saintess, you’ve finally come. We can rely on no one but you!” 
“We’re saved, we’re saved. I really thought I was going to die!” 
The residents spoke excitedly, reaching out and cheering. 
They were now very welcoming to Alice. 
Seeing their current demeanor, Alice’s gaze turned cold. She had been hiding, listening to their conversations. 
They had been clamoring to nail her to the cross for atonement. 
“The God wants me to live well, so now I only need to complete the mission given by the God… I’ve had enough of these demons in human skin!” 
Alice murmured as she drew out the black longsword! 
She directly activated a skill, “Super-tier Sword Skill · Iron Gale!” 
“Swish!” 
Several huge, tangible sword qi slashed towards the Gate of Heaven! 
The previously incredibly sturdy defense shattered like paper at that moment! 
Clin was shocked and fell off the city wall, completely stunned. “The Sword Saintess, she attacked my Gate of Heaven?” 
Even after being struck, he still couldn’t believe it! 
When he looked up, Alice was standing at the highest gate of the city wall, holding a longsword. 
Her blue eyes emitted an extremely intense, icy killing intent! 
Like ancient ice. 
It seemed that everyone she saw would die here. 
Clin’s heart trembled. Ignoring the pain from his fall, he hurriedly jumped up. “Sword, Sword Saintess! What are you doing!” 
Alice leapt out, but her strike missed. 
Without speaking, she attacked Clin again. 
“High-tier Magic Defense!” 
“Snap!” 
With a single strike, Clin’s most proud defensive magic shattered into sparkling fragments. 
Fragile as anything. 
Seeing this, Clin steeled his heart and shouted, “Avril, you all hide in the castle quickly! The Sword Saintess is acting strangely! Hurry!!!” 
He had a strong sense that the Sword Saintess intended to kill him, to kill all of them! 
Upon hearing this, the remaining members of Avril’s family quickly fled first. 
How could they care about anyone else? 
The remaining residents and soldiers were all stunned, fearfully moving closer to the Sword Saintess. 
Because a large number of goblins had already broken through the gate and swarmed into the castle square. 
But Lin Tian had given the order: they were not to act now. 
These people were to be killed by the Sword Saintess. 
The residents were finally relieved because Alice was blocking all the goblins. 
They felt completely safe. 
Even the children stopped crying. 
Lin Tian rode a flying dragon and slowly landed on the city wall, saying, “These people, to you, are demons, Alice. 
For ten years, you endured daily hardship and pain to protect them, dedicating yourself fully. Yet, because of one failure, they kept saying you blasphemed and should be nailed to the cross! 
If they’re not demons, who are? Remember, the God is with you.” 
Upon hearing this. 
Alice slowly turned her head, looking at the residents. 
This look scared the residents so much their hearts almost stopped! 
They all felt something was wrong, “Sword, Sword Saintess, don’t listen to the goblin’s temptation. We didn’t say we wanted to nail you to the cross!” 
“Yes, yes, yes, that was Avril saying it to gain prestige!” 
“That young woman is the real villain. If you want to kill, kill her. We still believe in you!” 
The residents fearfully explained. 
But Alice didn’t believe any of it. She had already heard it while hiding. 
Indeed, it was Avril who said it, but it was met with enthusiastic approval from all the residents. 
They even said they would build a monument to warn future generations. 
Not to blaspheme. 
Alice completely turned around, facing the residents and soldiers, holding her sword, slowly approaching. 
The commander of the soldiers stepped forward to beg for mercy, “Sword Saintess, we were wrong just now. We can…” 
Suddenly, the commander’s voice stopped abruptly. 
A blood line appeared across his head. 
Then, half of his head slid to the ground. 
He died on the spot! 
“I will use the methods I once used to slaughter monsters to deal with you, demons…”  
Alice directly charged into the crowd, cutting them down like slicing vegetables. 
Her sword never had a moment to dry, always stained with hot blood. 
Miserable screams echoed throughout the castle square, “No, Sword Saintess!! Don’t kill me, I apologize!” 
“I’m sorry! Please spare me!” 
“We admit our mistakes, can you let me go? Let my child go at least!” 
A large number of residents knelt behind, praying that Alice would show great mercy. 
But she had never shown mercy to monsters before. 
It was the same now. To her, humans were demons, monsters. 
No matter how much they begged, it couldn’t quell the anger that had been building up inside her. 
After a brief commotion, the square fell silent. 
Except for the goblins in the back, there were no signs of life among the thousands of people. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but remark, “Hmph, this plot is somewhat similar to Jesus back then, isn’t it? Saving people all his life, only to be nailed to the cross by those he saved.” 
However,  
Alicenia did not possess the unwavering kindness of Jesus. 
Rather than being forced to death, she preferred others to die. 
Inside the castle, 
Avril and the others were packing up, preparing to escape through a secret passage. 
Lin Tian had already sent Gobu Kuang and the others inside to hunt them down. 
Then, he hurried to follow, to avoid them being overpowered. 
In a luxurious bedroom, Avril was packing her father’s relics, “Why did it turn out like this? Even the Sword Saintess betrayed humanity! Goblin, I will kill you!” 
At that moment, the sound of the floor shaking came from outside the bedroom. 
Avril immediately became alert, holding a magic orb. 
“Boom!” 
Gobu Kuang smashed through the wall, sending Avril flying. Fortunately, she landed on the bed, or she would have lost half her life. 
“Heh heh heh, the boss will be very happy if I capture her, right?” 
Seeing Avril struggling to get up on the bed, Gobu Kuang’s eyes lit up. 
However, she was a magic genius. She reacted immediately, “High-tier Magic · Multiple Light Wheels!” 
Several light wheels slashed towards Gobu Kuang. 
Forcing him to retreat repeatedly, his axe could only block part of his body, and he was covered in blood marks. 
If it weren’t for his high defense and tough skin, he would have been shredded. 
Regaining control, Avril directly activated infinite fire mode, “High-tier Magic · Punishing Spear!” 
“High-tier Magic · Air Cannon!” 
“High-tier Magic · Ominous Hand!” 
… 
For a moment, Gobu Kuang was forced to retreat, unable to get close. 
He also cast a spell, “Evil Hand!” 
Two arms glowing with blue flames extended from his back, reaching out towards Avril! 
Grabbing one of her small feet, he swung her towards the wall! 
She spat blood from the impact, feeling dizzy. 
She couldn’t resist for a moment. 
Another hand grabbed her neck, trying to choke her unconscious and take her away. 
Her face began to turn purple. 
“Super-tier Magic · Soul Drain!” 
In despair, Avril used a large amount of energy to cast a super-tier magic she hadn’t fully mastered. 
Anything that touched her had its soul temporarily drawn out! 
A control-clearing and counter-control skill. 
Gobu Kuang’s eyes rolled back, losing consciousness and standing still. 
Avril was also thrown to the ground, panting as she crawled up, feeling both relieved and proud, “Hmph, want to kill me? You go die first, you ugly goblin!” 
She then cast a magic light ball, sending Gobu Kuang flying dozens of meters away! 
He broke through the wall and flew from the high castle to the outer square. 
Avril used a magic potion to recover from the pain and fatigue. 
She cursed, “That damned slut, she actually betrayed humanity. Otherwise, how could I have fallen to this? When I become a Grand Archmage, I’ll settle the score one by one!!” 
With a face full of unwillingness and anger, Avril prepared to go to the secret room exit to meet her family. 
When she got downstairs, she found goblins had already entered. 
“Did the people outside die so quickly?!” 
Avril found it hard to believe. 
Suddenly, a hero variant, along with several big variants, charged upstairs! 
Faced with such an attack, she calmly activated her magic orb, “High-tier Magic · Multiple Light Wheels!” 
In an instant, 
The group of goblins was dismembered into pieces! 
With a face of disdain, Avril walked down the stairs through the corpses, but then noticed something. 
A small green figure flashed by the door. 
“Another ant?” 
Avril followed, not because she would chase down a low-level goblin. 
It just happened to be on her way to the secret room. 
When she reached the living room door, she saw a small figure cowering and crying behind the door. 
“Don’t kill me, woo woo woo, I won’t dare anymore, can you spare me?” 
The small goblin cried, trembling, with snot and tears all over its face. 
Pitiful and disgusting. 
Avril frowned in disdain, “Hmph, today you’re lucky. Don’t let me see you again.” 
She ignored it and walked directly to the basement. 
It was too disgusting. Killing it would dirty her hands. 
Besides, meeting her family was more important. The soldiers outside were all dead, and if the goblin army broke in, it would be dangerous. 
But just as she passed by. 
The small goblin’s eyes revealed a cold, evil killing intent! 
It suddenly jumped onto Avril’s back! 
Biting down hard! 
Avril screamed in pain, almost fainting, full of terror, “Ah! It hurts, what is this!” 
Holding her neck, she staggered back, leaning against the wall, barely able to stand. 
From her neck, blood flowed profusely, uncontrollably. 
“Am I going to die? Damn little goblin!! I don’t want to die!” 
Avril’s pupils trembled, her body convulsing, feeling suffocated! 
Seeing the warm blood on her hands, her legs gave way, and she sat on the ground. 
With no strength left, she couldn’t use high-tier healing magic, and the low-tier ones were useless. 
She started crying loudly, “Grandfather, someone save me, I’m dying!” 
With her crying, her heart beat faster, pumping blood out even quicker. 
Her neck turned into a river of blood. 
She hated the little goblin in front of her for pretending to be pitiful! 
“It’s all your fault, you evil, despicable goblin. Why did you bite me? I didn’t even kill you!” 
Avril wept, as if uttering her final words. 
The small goblin suddenly spoke, “Kekeke, little girl, your biggest mistake was being too arrogant.” 
He was not a low-level monster. 
He was Lin Tian.
