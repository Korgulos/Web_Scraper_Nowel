Chapter 183: The Black Witch’s Divination, Sweating Profusely! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Her? She’s a female? A female!?” 
Veronica’s mouth hung open as she spoke in disbelief. 
Goblins never had females, but right in front of her was an adorable, obedient, and playful little girl. 
She looked completely different from the hideous and terrifying goblins. 
Lin Tian nodded. “Yes, there’s no need to be surprised.” 
“Wait, are you sure? When I was still human, I discovered that some men would dress themselves as women to seduce other men into having relationships with them.  
And guess what? The men who got seduced ended up being the ones who got screwed!” 
As Veronica spoke, she almost burst into laughter, but there was clear disdain and disgust in her tone. 
Gobu Yue quickly refuted, “I’m not like that at all, and besides, I…” 
Lin Tian cut in, “Don’t worry, we’ve checked. Gobu Yue is indeed a true female goblin. Since you were once human, you must know that legend, right?” 
“If a female appears among the goblin tribe, the goblin who mates with her will become… the Goblin God…” 
Veronica suddenly became serious, lowering her voice as she spoke each word deliberately. 
Gobu Yue blinked her big eyes, listening intently. 
She hadn’t realized that she could have such an effect. 
However, Veronica’s attitude suddenly shifted, and she spoke mockingly, “Hmph, even a fool knows that this legend is just meant to ridicule goblins as the weakest and lowest creatures. The Goblin God? A god is a god, and no one can become one.” 
“But…” 
Looking at the real female goblin in front of her,  
she couldn’t help but feel suspicious, her eyes fixed intently on Gobu Yue. 
Lin Tian frowned slightly, growing a bit impatient. “So, do you know or not?” 
“I truly don’t know the situation in front of me, but there are a few people who might.” Veronica paused after speaking. 
Lin Tian quickly pressed her, “Who are they? You don’t have the luxury of being mysterious right now.” 
“No, I just want to confirm something with you. Can you grant me a simple request? All I ask is that Rebecca be locked in my room.” As Veronica spoke, a sinister glint flashed in her eyes. 
Hearing this,  
Lin Tian thought for a moment. Since Rebecca was already under his control, it wouldn’t change anything. 
What harm would come from locking them up together? 
He agreed immediately, “No problem.” 
Veronica, sensing his agreement, continued, “Very well. I once had three servants, known as the Black Witches. They can predict the future and perform divination. All I need is some magic power, and I can summon them.” 
The Black Witches had no combat abilities and hadn’t participated in the Battle of Laiyang. 
So, they were still hiding in the Great Tomb. 
However,  
Lin Tian remained cautious. Giving her magic power was akin to raising a tiger, an extremely risky move. 
But then he remembered the Demon Sealing Sword. As long as he provided her with just a tiny bit of magic power, it would be enough to summon her servants. 
To be safe, he ordered, “Little Yue, go call the One-Eyed Owl back. Let her help keep things in check.” 
“Okay, Boss!” 
Gobu Yue donned her cloak and hurried out. 
Veronica sneered, “Hmph, you’re the ruler of a powerful monster empire now, yet you still lack the courage? Are you afraid of me? Or are you scared of the Black Witches? Don’t worry, they don’t have any combat abilities.” 
“Of course, I’m going to keep an eye on you. Let’s be clear, okay?” 
Lin Tian spread his hands, making his intentions obvious. 
He wasn’t afraid of any sort of provocation. 
As long as he had thick skin, there was nothing to fear. 
Veronica gritted her teeth in frustration. 
Suddenly, Lin Tian seemed to remember something, a wicked grin spreading across his face until it nearly reached his ears. 
Seeing this, 
Veronica grew truly fearful, forcing herself to shrink back. “You! What are you planning? You despicable, evil, shameless goblin! I’m nothing but bones—an undead! Are you really going to stoop so low as to violate even bones? I can’t imagine how twisted your desires are!” 
“You’re overthinking it. I have no interest, but if you don’t behave, I wouldn’t mind using that to humiliate you.” 
Lin Tian spoke irritably. His tastes had improved significantly now. 
If the target wasn’t exceptional, he had no interest. 
In the entire city, whenever he went out, women of all races would throw themselves at him, some even stripping in the streets to offer everything. 
Their goal was simple—to latch onto Lin Tian so that not only they but their entire race could walk freely and arrogantly in the Goblin Empire. 
This was quite a headache, but Lin Tian planned to deal with it later. 
He wanted them to understand the consequences of trying to outsmart a goblin. 
It wasn’t long before 
the One-Eyed Owl arrived. Her voice preceded her, “What’s going on, Little Tian? Need my help? My appearance fee is pretty high, you know. Can you afford it?” 
Hearing that voice, 
Veronica was shocked again, even doubting her own ears! 
“One-Eyed Owl? I didn’t realize it before, but is this the same One-Eyed Owl from the Dragon Slayer Guild? When did you…!!!” 
She remembered mentioning this to Lin Tian before. 
This was a creature that had hunted her multiple times, and she had barely escaped. 
Why was it here? 
And why did it seem so familiar with Lin Tian? 
In a short span of time, two things had already left her utterly shocked. 
When the One-Eyed Owl walked into the dungeon, she finally confirmed her suspicions. 
Seeing Veronica, the One-Eyed Owl paused in surprise, “Oh? Isn’t this the Demon King of the Great Tomb? I hunted you several times! I didn’t expect you’d actually get captured!” 
“That’s right, Big Sis. You say your appearance fee is expensive? Name your price.” Lin Tian chimed in, playing along. 
Of course, it was just a joke. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s lips curled into a slight smile, “Those guys from Osius were just telling me to marry you. Why don’t you just marry me?” 
Hearing this, Lin Tian almost couldn’t keep up. 
What did she mean by him marrying her? 
“Wait a minute, Big Sis, I’m a man. Shouldn’t you marry me? I’d definitely agree, come on, let’s have the wedding right away.” Lin Tian responded, accepting the offer immediately. 
How could he refuse such a good deal? 
Smack! 
The One-Eyed Owl smacked Lin Tian on the head, hard. “What are you dreaming about, you little brat? Trying to take advantage of me? I’m worried your little body wouldn’t hold up! Hmph!” 
“Lin Tian, how did you do it? What have you been up to lately!?” 
Veronica, who had been silent, couldn’t hold back her curiosity any longer. 
A powerhouse with a combat strength of 13,000, someone she had always kept a respectful distance from, was now so familiar with Lin Tian. 
Hearing her question, Lin Tian didn’t bother hiding anything. “Nothing much, just swallowed up the War Empire, and then gave that so-called Saintess, Joan of Arc, a bit of a beating.” 
“What? You even swallowed up the War Empire! And you dared provoke Saintess Joan of Arc too? Are you crazy?!” 
Veronica was so stunned she couldn’t stay calm. 
Such explosive news was simply too overwhelming. 
She muttered in disbelief, “You actually provoked Joan of Arc, a demigod! Do you have no idea of the overwhelming power of a demigod? It seems you’re not far from death. Don’t drag me down with you!” 
She had been planning to escape during the chaos if Lin Tian was ever overthrown. 
If Joan of Arc killed him, she’d undoubtedly be doomed as well. 
It was sheer madness. 
“Enough with the chatter. I’ll give you the magic power, so hurry up and summon your servants.” 
Lin Tian’s tone suddenly turned cold as he extended his hand and transferred some of his magic power to her. 
Immediately, 
Veronica began to activate her summoning ability. A black vortex appeared before them. 
Soon, the Black Witches began to take shape. 
She didn’t dare pull any tricks; they were all smart enough to know this was the best approach. 
And she knew Lin Tian’s personality—if she pushed too far, it wouldn’t end well. 
“Lord Demon! You’ve finally summoned me. Are you okay? Where’s Lady Rebecca and the others?” 
Three hunchbacked, hideous, eyeless witches appeared. 
The leading witch held a single eye in her hand, which provided the shared vision for all three. 
Seeing Veronica bound in chains, they grew anxious. “Lord Demon, you…” 
Then they turned their gaze toward Lin Tian and the others, fear overwhelming them as they stumbled into a corner, too terrified to make a sound. 
Seeing this, Veronica sighed. “You three, perform a divination on that goblin. Focus on its evolution.” 
“Heh, how interesting, such a bizarre creature.” The One-Eyed Owl commented from the side, watching with amusement. 
The Black Witches hesitated, filled with confusion. 
After being scolded, they quickly set to work. 
They removed the eye from their hands, placed it within a magic circle, and began to dance around it in a ritualistic manner. 
They chanted strange incantations under their breath. 
The eye emitted a dazzling light, and in the next moment, the dungeon around them transformed into an endless black void! 
In the distance, a faint light glimmered. 
It seemed to be the answer they were seeking. 
The group appeared to be traversing through this vast starry sky, rapidly closing in on the answer. 
Yet the closer they got, the further it seemed. The Black Witches danced faster and faster, their chanting growing more intense. 
An hour passed swiftly. 
Veronica’s expression turned grave. “For a divination to take this long, what on earth…” 
The more significant the subject of the divination, the longer it took. 
This was the longest divination she had ever witnessed. 
Suddenly, 
the bodies of the Black Witches began to tremble violently, moving so fast they became a blur! It was as if they were dancing at ten times the normal speed. 
Pffft! 
Finally, just as the group reached the light and returned to reality, the three witches collapsed to the ground, spitting blood. 
The eye exploded as well. 
Seeing this, Veronica couldn’t help but ask, “What happened? Did you see the goblin’s evolution method?” 
“Ah… Lord Demon, that goblin… that goblin is the god prophesied in the Laiyang Plains!!!” 
“They previously divined that a god would be born on the Laiyang Plains. Who would have thought it would be him!” 
“Oh my god, my eyes! My eyes couldn’t withstand the overwhelming power. His future… I can’t see it!” 
The three witches spoke in pain and shock, their voices filled with despair. 
Lin Tian grabbed one of them by the collar. “So you’ve been talking all this time—what about the evolution method?” 
“Your evolution method is unique. You won’t evolve as a goblin; you will evolve into a god! The method… the method is…” 
As the black blood continued to spill from the witch’s mouth, she died before she could finish her sentence. 
Seeing this, 
Lin Tian almost cursed out loud. Could the plot really be this ridiculous? 
“Your evolution method requires you to devour gods!” 
On the ground, another black witch managed to say this before she too died on the spot. 
Fortunately, there was still one more left. Lin Tian quickly held onto her. “Oh god, please don’t let this one die too. Tell me the details!” 
The last black witch, with blood oozing from her mouth, mumbled indistinctly, “You need to devour a certain number of demigods to become a demigod, and then devour… gods…” 
After saying this, she also finally died. 
Lin Tian wiped the sweat from his forehead and let go. 
Luckily, the plot wasn’t as absurd as he had feared. 
Still, it had him sweating bullets. 
… 
I bet devouring doesn’t mean literally eating here… &gt;:)
