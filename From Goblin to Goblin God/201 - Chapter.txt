Chapter 201: I Give Up, Joan of Arc You Schemer! 
TL: Sungmin  
He turned his head. 
What he saw were a pair of glowing, sinister red eyes. 
Immediately, a sense of fear crept up on him.  
“You… you…” 
Before he could finish his sentence. 
Veronica controlled the Night Demon at once.  
“You’ve said enough…” 
“Mmph! Mmph!” 
Instantly, 
From the sky, the black aura surrounding the Night Demon morphed into numerous black wraiths! 
Their hollow eyes and mouths were extremely eerie. 
They reached out toward Zolt’s group, grasping at them! 
“No, don’t come closer! What are you doing!” 
“Veronica, you despicable, shameless fiend! You’ve lived for a thousand years as an undead, and you repay kindness with betrayal!” 
“Aaaaah! Help me, my soul… it’s being torn away…” 
As soon as the black wraiths swept through the air! 
The ten elite members of the Giant Elephant Empire under Zolt all turned into stiff, twisted corpses, collapsing onto the ground. 
Their eyes were hollow. 
Their souls had already become part of the Night Demon. 
They were annihilated, wiped out in an instant—strong warriors with a combat power of over 9,000, though their strength mainly came from controlling puppets. 
But, judging by how easily the Night Demon wiped out the Dragon Slayer Guild members, it didn’t make much of a difference. 
This was pure domination. 
Everyone witnessing the scene couldn’t help but take a few steps back. This method of killing was too bizarre! 
In such a short time, no one could comprehend what had just happened or think of any countermeasures. 
If they were attacked now, there were only two words left: “Wait to die!” 
However, a black rift unfolded in the sky once again, pulling the Night Demon back into it! 
It was clear that the Night Demon was still struggling, yearning to escape. 
Fortunately, it was finally dragged back, and everything returned to normal. 
“Your Goblin Majesty, go ahead and lock me up again. I know that fighting against you will lead to no future victory, even if I win now. My request is simple: I’ve dealt with them for you. Can you let Rebecca stay with me?” Veronica spoke as though she were a loyal subordinate. 
This maneuver. 
Everyone was left utterly stunned. 
Sara was utterly confused. “Why would she… clearly, the Night Demon she just summoned could have defeated everyone and ruled this kingdom…” 
“What the hell did you do to her! Did you break her brain or something?” the One-Eyed Owl couldn’t help but exclaim. 
Every face was filled with complete bewilderment! 
Gobu Kuang chuckled. “I knew Boss had a way to handle it!” 
“Ugh, you idiot. Boss didn’t even make a move,” Gobu Tian said helplessly. 
Lin Tian smiled lightly and replied, “Your request is reasonable. Gobu Jian? Make sure you do your job.” 
“Yes, Boss. It won’t happen again.” 
Gobu Jian had already gathered a large army of goblins, but it was completely unnecessary. 
He picked up the Magic-Sealing Sword and, suppressing his fear, walked up to Veronica and began absorbing the remaining magic power. 
No one expected her to be so terrified, given how often Lin Tian had toyed with her. 
They all thought she was a useless weakling by now! 
In just a few seconds, all her power was drained. 
It was clear her magic had already been depleted. 
Veronica’s expression was deeply complicated; she even considered praying to the gods! 
After all, she had lost the earlier gambit, and it was clear that Lin Tian wasn’t falling for her ploys. 
So, she abruptly changed her plan, killing Zolt’s group to show her loyalty, hoping to earn Lin Tian’s favor through this “offering.” 
“You’re wondering why I won’t give you a chance to free yourself, aren’t you? It seems, Demon King, that you’re slowly starting to try and please me.” Lin Tian spoke smugly. 
Veronica froze for a moment, then couldn’t help but ask, “Lin Tian, you’ve wronged me, so why are you still so guarded against me? Without me, would you have achieved what you have today?! I’ve already let go of past grudges, and I only wish for the simple life of freedom I crave. Is that too much of a threat to you?!” 
Hearing the despair and grievance in her voice. 
If she still had tear ducts, she would have been crying already. 
Lin Tian raised an eyebrow and corrected her, “First of all, you never did me any favors. When I first entered the Great Tomb, it was the Cannibal Eagle who looked after me. Later, when you gave me a position, it was only because you wanted me to fight against the Lionheart Empire as your cannon fodder.” 
“You…!” 
Veronica’s expression shifted slightly, surprised that Lin Tian had known this all along. 
“Besides, I don’t like people who can predict and scheme because they are dangerous—like you.” Lin Tian’s voice was cold. 
People like her were hard to deal with—just like him. 
So he knew exactly who should be kept around and who shouldn’t. 
Fiona simply wanted her people to survive. 
The One-Eyed Owl was just a battle-crazed maniac. 
Lia, Gobu Slayer, and Katheryn had long since become mere playthings. 
None of these people posed any real threat. 
And Gobu Kuang and the other three—no need to even mention them. 
Veronica was filled with despair and unwillingness, but she had no retort. Finally, she said, “I’ve already admitted that I’m not your match. Can’t you at least give me one chance, Your Goblin Majesty?” 
Lin Tian didn’t respond. 
He simply watched as Gobu Jian escorted Veronica back into the undestroyed depths of the dungeon. 
At that moment, Veronica was utterly filled with despair. 
But suddenly. 
Lin Tian’s voice rang out, “Let her go, Gobu Jian.” 
“Yes, Boss…” 
Gobu Jian followed orders decisively. 
Yet Veronica was stunned, in disbelief at the voice she had just heard!!! 
The despair that had weighed her down vanished completely. 
In its place was a renewed sense of vigor! 
She immediately snapped her head around. “You…” 
“I was just waiting for the moment when you’d finally lower yourself, and willingly submit at my feet. Besides, Rebecca is mine now too, so there’s no harm in letting you go.” Lin Tian shrugged as he spoke. 
He intentionally delayed his decision to release her, making Veronica regain hope from the depths of despair. 
This feeling would be etched in her memory, making her even more grateful. 
Without hesitation, Veronica dropped to her knees. “Your Majesty, I’ve lived for over a thousand years and seen countless strong beings, but you are the only one I truly acknowledge! Not only do you have the power to become a god, but your methods are also unbeatable!” 
“Hmph, is that so… Words are meaningless. I can let you and Rebecca live a simple life in the countryside, and I can ensure humans accept you. But when the time comes for you to die for me, you mustn’t hesitate. Because if it’s not you, then it’ll be Rebecca who dies…” 
Lin Tian’s tone suddenly turned sharp and cold. 
Veronica was incredibly excited. “Of course! Your Majesty, I will gladly die for you!!” 
“Come out, Rebecca. If you love me, stay with this woman for now. But if she ever tries to harm me, you’ll be the first to fight her—until you’re killed. Okay?” Lin Tian spoke in a tone full of deep emotion. 
Rebecca, who had been hiding, suddenly appeared.  
“My love, I’ll do anything you say!” 
She then turned to Veronica.  
“Let’s go.” 
“Alright!” 
Veronica was trembling all over, barely able to contain her excitement as she left the city with Rebecca. 
They headed toward the human-occupied regions. 
Alice, watching their backs, said solemnly, “Are we really letting them go like this? It’s clear from what just happened that Veronica is much stronger than we imagined.” 
“If she really wanted to flip the table, she wouldn’t have recalled the Night Demon just now.” Lin Tian replied. 
He didn’t care about losing Rebecca—what mattered most was Veronica’s potential to disrupt things. 
There would be great use for her later. 
He remembered her battle with the old Pope, when the Pope had summoned the archangel Gabriel. 
Gabriel had vowed to settle the score with these monsters. 
That wasn’t just an idle threat. 
That was a real angel! 
While angels weren’t gods, they were still on par with them in terms of power. 
If their army marched, even ten million goblins would just be fodder for leveling up. 
But the aberrant creatures Veronica summoned had the power to fight back. 
And if he could capture a few angels, well, that would be an incredible reward. 
Sacrificing one Rebecca wasn’t a big deal. 
Looking at the ruined palace, Lin Tian dismissed the damage. He had been planning to rebuild it for a while anyway. 
Lin Tian spoke indifferently, “I’m going to sleep. You all can do whatever you need to.” 
The chaos of the three kingdoms had come to an end. 
Sara was still in shock and disbelief. This goblin had far surpassed her imagination. 
He had surpassed anyone’s imagination. 
Like a little kitten, she hurried to follow closely behind him. 
“What are you doing? I’m going to sleep,” Lin Tian said, surprised. 
Sara bit her lip, her nervous, heated breath clearly audible in the quiet night. 
Then she spoke, “My king, there’s nowhere left to sleep here. Why not come to my place..?” 
“Oh? Sure,” Lin Tian smiled faintly, realizing her will was weaker than he had thought. 
But he couldn’t blame her. 
A goblin’s ability was designed to conquer all females. 
Otherwise, she wouldn’t have worried about showing her shameful side to the people of the Troy Empire. 
Even she was embarrassed by her behavior, a humiliation that cut deep. 
In the distance. 
Osius and Grugia grumbled, “Damn it, that guy’s going off with another beauty again. I’m so jealous I could die!” 
“I don’t get it. Can goblins really use that ability to conquer women just like that?” Osius asked, his face full of envy, jealousy, and resentment. 
Grugia scratched his head and suddenly had an epiphany. “Do you think Big Sis’s personality would change if she, uh, did it with him? Would she turn into a woman who never leaves his bed? Hehehe!” 
“Watch your mouth! You’re talking behind Big Sis’s back again!” Osius’s tone suddenly became strict. 
Seeing this, Grugia rolled his eyes. “You hypocrite! Stop pretending to be so righteous.” 
“You’re hopeless!” Osius sighed repeatedly before turning around and bowing respectfully. “Big Sis, I’ll leave this one for you to deal with!” 
“Alright, but I think you’re a problem too. If I’m going to deal with one, I might as well deal with both!” 
The One-Eyed Owl had somehow appeared behind them, fists already clenched for a fight. 
One punch landed, and he couldn’t withstand it at all! 
The pain distorted his face beyond recognition! 
Everyone else scattered, finding a place to rest for the time being. 
The task of rebuilding would certainly have to wait until Lin Tian gave further orders. 
… 
Twilight City. 
Now, it had been largely overtaken by goblins. 
A massive number of soldiers were breeding here. Once each batch of one hundred thousand was raised, they were sent to Goblin King City. 
However, not far away, a heavily armed army was advancing in grand formation! 
At the very front, riding a white horse, Joan of Arc donned silver armor and held the Sword of Faith high, shouting, “Liberate the humans of Twilight City who’ve been forced to serve as goblin breeding machines!!” 
… 
Demon Sealing Sword changed to Magic-Sealing Sword.
