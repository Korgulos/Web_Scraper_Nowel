Chapter 66: Draw Your Sword, Alice 
TL: Sungmin  
“Do you see the tens of thousands of lions behind me? I won’t give you a chance. I will come in and crush your bones! For my grandfather and Alice!!!” 
Klein gritted his teeth, ready to give the order to start the battle at any moment. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian got excited. “Oh? So that’s how it is. Let me secretly tell you, the taste of the Sword Saintess was very… smooth…” 
“You! Shut up!!” 
Klein was so enraged by these words that he almost couldn’t catch his breath. 
Even the soldiers behind him were infuriated. 
The Sword Saintess was a respected figure throughout the entire empire. 
No one could tolerate her being desecrated, but now, she had been directly defiled. 
Lin Tian laughed heartily, “What, you want me to shut this mouth that has tasted those sweet lips? The taste is even sweeter than honey.” 
“You! You!” 
Klein’s eyes were bloodshot and fierce. “Your Highness, let’s charge in directly! I want to grind his bones to dust right now!” 
“Grind my bones to dust? I think you want to hear about other places of the Sword Saintess. Let me secretly tell you… even sweeter!” Lin Tian added another stab. 
Originally, he had just wanted to come over and take a look at the situation, as the dense forest below made it impossible for the dragon to hide. 
He had no choice but to expose himself. 
Encountering this guy, he decided to taunt and provoke him. 
Lin Tian felt it was boring and had only said a few words before Klein lost his temper. “Oh, look, he’s angry, he’s angry.” 
The veins on Klein’s forehead bulged, his previously elegant noble demeanor completely gone. “Your Highness!” 
“Wait, Duke. The scouts haven’t returned yet. Rushing into the Great Tomb recklessly is dangerous.” One of the Holy Guards said gravely. 
Only they had personally experienced the horrors of the Great Tomb. 
A young man like Klein wouldn’t know, and now he was losing his temper, nearly losing his mind. 
“Scouts?” 
Lin Tian was slightly stunned and threw down the head of the scout from earlier. 
It rolled to the hooves of Klein’s warhorse. 
Seeing this scene, Klein couldn’t hold back any longer and shouted, “All troops, heed my command! Charge in! Slaughter all the monsters!” 
The massive army seemed to be activated and started to move! 
The orderly steps were like the countdown to the enemy’s death, ticking away bit by bit. 
“Hahaha! Are you scared? Are you afraid! This is the consequence of angering the lions! I will crush your bones!” Klein laughed arrogantly. 
He rode his warhorse, ready to charge directly into the enchanted forest. 
But when he shifted his gaze from Lin Tian to the forest ahead, his whole body froze! 
Goosebumps rose on his back! 
In the dim forest, a pair of eerie, blood-red eyes stared at him, sending chills down his spine! 
The Holy Guards, who had been silently reciting the Bible, suddenly sensed an extreme threat and picked up their weapons! 
Out of the forest, a Cannibal Eagle slowly emerged. 
Klein, looking at it, unknowingly broke out in cold sweat. His warrior’s instinct told him this creature was not to be trifled with! 
Its appearance was like a guillotine hanging over everyone’s heads. 
Ready to fall at any moment, meaning it could kill anyone at any time! 
The Cannibal Eagle ignored Klein and looked at the Holy Guards. “Church, long time no see. Have you forgotten the pact you made?” 
“It’s the Cannibal Eagle, everyone be careful!” One of the Holy Guards said. 
The leader of these Holy Guards, the Guardian of the Sanctuary, spoke, “Cannibal Eagle, this is the Pope’s order. You have no right to negotiate with us. 
Those goblins committed unforgivable crimes and just entered the Great Tomb. We have the right to go in and exterminate them.” 
As he spoke, he raised his massive sword and pointed it at the Great Tomb! 
Imposing and majestic! 
But the Cannibal Eagle showed no fear. “Hahaha! Is that old man still alive? Your arrogance won’t last long. When that old man finally dies of old age, I’ll personally crush your skull!” 
Humans could only live for a hundred years. 
But most monsters could live for hundreds of years, and some, like the undead, could even achieve immortality. 
The strongest in the Great Tomb happened to be one of the undead. 
So they could outlast the Pope no matter what. 
“You don’t need to worry about the future. I will say this one last time: I am here by the Pope’s order to exterminate the goblins. If you dare to stop us, you will die!” 
The Sanctuary Guardian’s cold and resolute aura instantly snapped Klein and the others out of their shock. 
Upon hearing this, Klein shouted again, “All troops, heed my command, continue advancing!!!” 
“Boom! Boom! Boom!” 
The army marched forward! Unstoppable! 
The Cannibal Eagle fell silent for a moment, then slowly flew up and said, “It seems you think the Great Tomb is a place you can enter and leave as you please…!” 
Immediately, a piercing screech echoed! 
The forest began to stir! 
“Crack! Crack!” 
The sound of trees snapping and falling echoed continuously! Pairs of blood-red eyes opened in the dim forest! 
Dense and numerous, they formed an impenetrable wall! 
Moreover, dozens of Cannibal Eagles also flew up from the forest, and it wasn’t just Cannibal Eagles. 
The Feathered Serpent tribe, a type of subhuman species, also appeared. 
With the body of a snake and the wings of a bird, their overall strength was around the seventh tier. 
There was once even a Feathered Serpent God who reached the twelfth tier! 
In the forest, more and more eyes gathered, and the continuous low growls of terrifying beasts instilled fear in people. 
The advancing army, upon seeing the dense mass of crimson eyes ahead, was too frightened to move forward. 
At this moment, Lin Tian noticed that many monsters were gathering in the forest. 
There were the Tiger Clan, Goblins, the Undead, and many more. 
Even many low-intelligence monsters had come under the skill call of the Cannibal Eagle. 
Hundred-Legged Centipedes, Razor Mantises, Spore Monsters, Rock Giants… 
Nearly twenty seventh-tier monsters! 
In total, there were thousands of monsters here! 
The overwhelming pressure paralyzed the tens of thousands of Imperial soldiers, making them too afraid to advance! 
Klein swallowed hard, and after calming down, he raised his sword again, gritting his teeth, preparing to shout the charge order once more. 
However, the Sanctuary Guardian spoke first, “So, the Great Tomb has decided to shelter those goblins?” 
“You can think of it that way.” The Cannibal Eagle said contemptuously. 
Upon hearing this, the Sanctuary Guardian was silent for a moment, then turned, “Duke, withdraw the troops.” 
“Your Highness, did I hear wrong? Withdraw? The lions of the Empire would rather die in battle than become deserters! I want to kill that guy!” Klein said, unwilling to give up. 
The Sanctuary Guardian suddenly looked at him, “This is not retreating, but preparing for a bigger battle…” 
Through the gap in the helmet, Klein saw those eyes emitting a faint golden light. 
The shocking gaze made him calm down instantly. 
As if he understood something. 
Klein turned and shouted to the soldiers, “All troops, retreat! Remember, the lions are not running away, but preparing to return!” 
On the way back, Klein couldn’t help but ask, “The Great Tomb is willing to go to war with us and the Church just to shelter that guy?” 
“No, the Great Tomb is no longer afraid of the Church…” 
The Sanctuary Guardian walked a few steps ahead, saying nothing more. 
Watching them leave, Lin Tian was truly moved, “Lord, isn’t this a bit much, going to such lengths for me?” 
The Cannibal Eagle smiled indifferently, gesturing for everyone to disperse. 
Then he looked at Lin Tian, “You know, this isn’t just for you. It’s to use your situation to tell those Church guys that our Great Tomb no longer fears them.” 
“I see.” 
Lin Tian somewhat understood, but overall, it seemed the Cannibal Eagle was a trustworthy guy. 
Just as he was about to leave, the Cannibal Eagle added, “By the way, develop your tribe as quickly as possible. There’s someone very important in the Great Tomb who thinks highly of you. They asked me to tell you that if you can become the Goblin King, you will qualify to enter the true Great Tomb.” 
Upon hearing this. 
Lin Tian didn’t think there was anything particularly extraordinary about the Great Tomb. 
However, seeing the longing in the Cannibal Eagle’s eyes, it seemed there might really be something good inside. 
But for now, he had finally secured a truly safe golden period for development. 
In at most a year, he could build an army strong enough to confront the Empire! 
“The Great Tomb, indeed, has very rich resources…” 
Lin Tian said, riding the dragon back to the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
He needed to make the most of these resources to develop as quickly as possible. 
… 
Lionheart Empire, Imperial City. 
The time was the fifth day after Klein had left with his troops. 
Charles II was already busy to the point of exhaustion. “Enough already! The goblin issue hasn’t been resolved, and now there’s another mess!” 
Upon hearing this, the many ministers who had come down from the Sanctuary to discuss matters with him forced a smile and hurriedly withdrew. 
Charles II sighed continuously. 
He sat for a long time before finally getting up and heading towards the church. 
Looking through the window at the Sword Saintess inside, his eyes were full of sorrow and helplessness. 
At this moment, the Holy Mother noticed him and whispered, “Your Majesty, you are…” 
“You know the current situation. What do you think I should do?” Charles II asked helplessly. 
The Holy Mother was silent for a moment before finally deciding, “It depends on your own thoughts, Your Majesty. One side is the people, and the other is her.” 
The news that the Sword Saintess had given birth to a goblin had already spread throughout the imperial city. 
The residents were staging large-scale protests, demanding the execution of that goblin. 
Especially those villagers from out of town who had been plundered by goblins, they hated them to the core. 
Having nowhere to vent their anger, this was now the best place. 
“Kill the goblin! Nobles must set an example!” 
“The human territory cannot tolerate a goblin living!” 
“Kill it! Avenge my child! It must be killed!!!” 
“If you don’t kill it, we won’t rest for a day!” 
On the streets, outside the church. 
Countless residents gathered, expressing their hatred for goblins. 
With internal and external troubles, the Lionheart Emperor hadn’t slept for days. 
In the church. 
Finally, Charles II walked in, calmly saying, “Alice, are you feeling better lately?” 
“Your Majesty? I’m not sick, why do you ask that?” Alicenia asked, puzzled. 
She was rocking a wooden horse, upon which sat the goblin she had given birth to. 
In a few days, it had already grown to the size of a baby. 
Looking at that evil face, drooling, and frantically shaking the wooden horse, making a ‘crack crack’ sound, Charles II’s face darkened instantly. 
A naturally evil monster, the wooden horse was originally a toy for children. 
In its hands, it was violently dismantled. 
There were already two broken wooden horses piled beside it. 
He then coldly asked, “Alice, have you heard the noise outside these days?” 
“Yes, I have.” Alicenia said indifferently. 
Charles II’s expression suddenly became serious, “Then what do you think?” 
However, Alicenia didn’t care at all. “I don’t care about them. I am now just an ordinary person, no longer the Sword Saintess.” 
Hearing this. 
Charles II seemed struck by lightning. 
He finally made that decision. 
“To think you’ve changed because of a goblin. I should have nipped this in the bud back then…” Charles II said painfully. 
The sound of metal scraping was heard. 
He slowly drew the golden-hilted sword from his waist. 
Looking at Alice, he said, “Alice, step aside a bit. I might hurt you…”
