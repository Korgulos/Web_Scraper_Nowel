Chapter 103: Are You Going to Have Children for Me??? 
TL: Sungmin 
“Let me take the path that no one has thought of!” 
Lin Tian seemed to have made a firm decision. 
He bit his teeth and closed his eyes. 
,,, 
“Hey? Where’s the boss? Are you the boss?” 
Gobu Kuang looked at the large group of big goblins behind him in confusion. 
They all looked the same, so he couldn’t tell them apart. 
Gobu Tian cursed, “Can you stop being so annoying? The boss is already fed up with you.” 
“Oh…” 
After the hustle and bustle ended. 
Lin Tian finally returned to Alice and the others. 
The others hadn’t noticed, but Alice had seen Lin Tian leave earlier, so she couldn’t help but ask, “Messenger, what were you doing just now?” 
“Nothing.” 
Seeing that things might be exposed, Lin Tian quickly shook his head in denial. 
Finally, a ray of sunlight appeared ahead. 
This indicated they had reached the edge of the Great Tomb. 
“Is it coming…” 
Both Lin Tian and Alice and the others felt a bit nervous. 
They stepped out of the Great Tomb, heading towards the main battlefield. 
,,, 
“Where’s the scout? Why hasn’t he returned yet? Could he have died again? Those damned goblins, this is a declaration of war. If you don’t send them back, how will I know if you’ve accepted the challenge?!” 
Charles II, clad in bronze armor and having replaced his crown with a helmet, was cursing Lin Tian furiously in the military camp. 
Killing even a messenger was too despicable and shameless. 
The faces of the numerous commanding barons in the tent also looked grim. 
Klein couldn’t help but comfort him, “Your Majesty, don’t get angry with a goblin. He does these things precisely because he’s a goblin.” 
“I can’t wait to kill him right now!” 
Charles II’s anger surged, as he was utterly fed up. 
At this moment, a frontline scout rushed in, “Your Majesty, the goblins… have arrived!” 
“Hmph, finally here! Alice, I’ll bring you home!” 
Charles II and his men rushed out of the tent, readying the soldiers. 
Preparing for battle. 
“Boom…” 
However, when they felt the unusual, intense trembling of the ground, their brows furrowed with a sense of gravity. 
Things seemed to be beyond their expectations. 
“What is that?! Why does it give such a strong sense of discomfort to the mind and body?” 
“My God, this scale, there must be a hundred thousand goblins, and so many monsters!” 
“How is that possible? In just half a year, how could a goblin tribe develop so fast!” 
Everyone’s faces contorted into exaggerated, twisted expressions! 
It was unbelievable to the extreme, making them doubt their sanity! 
Goblin tribes couldn’t possibly unite and merge. 
These hundred thousand goblins that appeared out of nowhere made them feel like they were dreaming! 
One must know that a hundred thousand goblins could consume tens of tons of food in a day! 
A hundred tons of food could pile up into a small mountain. 
Where did so much food come from? 
Charles II gritted his teeth, calming himself, “What’s there to fear? We have a hundred thousand fully armored soldiers. Even if there were two hundred thousand goblins, we could still win!” 
“But Your Majesty, what about those two black, unsettling monsters?!” A marquis couldn’t help but ask. 
Humans, when faced with the unknown, were either filled with curiosity or fear. 
At this moment, the cardinal walked over, flipping through a bible, “Those are heretical creatures, the spawn of the Black Goat, mentioned in the bible. Tell all soldiers not to look at them directly. 
The Black Goat Mother Goddess periodically expels eggs from her body, but I didn’t expect them to appear here.” 
Hearing this explanation, everyone was still confused. 
Many had never heard of the Black Goat Mother Goddess. 
After all, it was an ancient matter. 
Charles II didn’t pay much attention and instead asked, “Where is His Holiness the Pope?” 
“He is in the rear. I’ve come to help you lead the charge and was given this.” The cardinal said, taking out a long sword. 
It was the Holy Sword of Alicenia. 
The holy sword was originally an eleventh-tier magical weapon, composed of two parts: the blade and the holy cross hilt. 
Due to the rarity of magical weapons, it had been split into two for use. 
Now, combined into one, it was named the Holy Cross Sword. 
It could now exert its true power. 
The blade was 30 centimeters longer, and the hilt was a large golden cross shape, allowing it to be held with both hands. 
Charles II’s face darkened as he looked at the sword, “Is that so? I believe it should be returned to its original owner.” 
“Don’t worry, that’s my goal. When the undead make their move, the old Pope will also take action.” The cardinal added. 
In a situation where both sides had top-tier strongmen of similar strength. 
Whoever struck first had a higher chance of failure. 
Magic and skills couldn’t be used indiscriminately, as each use came with a significant cost. 
That’s why the lower ranks were always sent to fight first; if they could force the enemy’s trump card to act first, they would be one step closer to victory. 
Moreover, the old pope was already frail and weak. The initial consumption from striking first would be irreparable. 
One action would leave him weaker. 
This was why Veronica allowed Lin Tian to wantonly deplete the resources of the Great Tomb and provided him with protection. 
Lin Tian and his army had already reached the middle of the battlefield. 
They first surveyed the surrounding terrain. 
This place was called the ‘Laiyang Plains.’ 
The area was relatively flat, with soft grass and various flowers growing on the ground. 
It was indeed very suitable for battle, with no fear of ambushes or traps. 
“Boom… Swoosh!” 
Ahead, the soldiers of the Lionheart Empire also began to move. 
Whether it was their marching or getting into formation, the thunderous sounds were uniform and synchronized. 
The silver armor reflected the dazzling white light under the sun, 
dazzling to the extreme. 
A strong military presence exuded from them, 
full of oppressive force. 
However, Lin Tian’s side remained very calm. 
They waited for the enemy to approach. 
Charles II immediately locked his eyes on the low-level goblin standing at the forefront and asked, “Is it him? Is it really just a low-level goblin?” 
“That’s right. I encountered that damned beast before!” Klein gritted his teeth with a vicious snarl. 
He would never forget Lin Tian’s words and would never forgive what he had done! 
His most revered role model and goddess had been defiled by a goblin! 
He swore silently, “Alice, I will bring you home! Even if it costs me my life!” 
Charles II nodded, knowing it was enough to identify the most hateful guy. 
But suddenly. 
He saw that familiar face. 
Pure and flawless, with a pair of captivating azure eyes. 
However, the natural innocence and purity in those eyes had vanished, replaced only by darkness and coldness. 
Charles II disregarded everything else and shouted, “Alice! I’ve come to take you home, come here, child!” 
But the Sword Saintess only glanced at him without responding. 
The coldness in her eyes seemed like an icy sword piercing Charles II’s heart, “Why, child, have you forgotten your people? They need your protection!” 
“Yes, Princess Alice, do you remember me? We used to train together every day, and you often pinned me to the ground!” Klein also called out. 
They had discussed it beforehand, deciding to set aside Alice’s massacre. 
And if she could change her mind, they wouldn’t even hold her accountable. 
“Shut up!” 
Suddenly, this sharp reprimand stunned Charles II and his men. 
Alice said angrily, “Don’t mention them to me. I still have to kill more of those damn demons! I won’t come back, Charles II!” 
She had suffered for over ten years, all to protect those people. 
In the end, those people wanted her dead. 
Return? Are you insane? 
On Lin Tian’s side, not only could she communicate with God, but there was also no pressure like before. 
Which side was better was clear even to a fool. 
But ultimately, deep down, Alicenia was still evading. She knew some things could never be made right. 
So she might as well go all the way. 
“Alicenia, look at this! Have you forgotten the responsibility the church bestowed upon you?” 
At this moment, the cardinal took out the Holy Cross Sword. 
At that moment, it was clear that Alice was somewhat shaken, her expression changing. 
Charles II and his men’s eyes lit up with excitement. 
They felt there was a possibility of bringing her back. 
However, Alice only showed a disdainful expression, “Do you want to see my sword?” 
She then pulled out the Ominous Blade. 
The contained demonic energy surged into the sky! 
The entire sky visibly darkened for a moment before gradually recovering. 
The cardinal’s expression turned grave as he stared at that sword, finding it extremely troublesome. 
“That’s enough. You shameless people, is it fun to keep pestering?” 
At this moment, the low-level goblin under Lin Tian’s control spoke in a lowered voice. 
Full of arrogance and disrespect. 
Immediately, Charles II’s face turned into a hideous and terrifying expression, his words flying with spittle. 
It was as if a lion’s roar could be heard, full of hatred, “Lin Tian! I’ve underestimated you, you damned beast! To think you created so many goblins in such a short time. Truly worthy of being a beast!!!” 
“What did you do to Princess Alice?! Ahhh!” 
Klein was almost about to lose it! 
He had spent every moment recently improving his strength just to bring Alice back. 
He must personally kill Lin Tian! 
“You call yourself a king, yet you lack even a bit of decency?” Lin Tian responded irritably, directly taking the moral high ground. 
He began to point and criticize him. 
This move was a killer. 
However, Charles II was shameless now, “Hmph, you think you can lecture me about morals and decency? Don’t you know what you’ve done? Killing my people, kidnapping my people, committing all sorts of evil! I’m here today to wipe out you pests!” 
“That’s too much. What do you mean by ‘all sorts of evil’? Did we do anything wrong?” As he spoke, he turned to ask the goblins. 
They all answered in unison that they hadn’t. 
Lin Tian continued, “I am a goblin. God gave me the ability to grow stronger by consuming flesh and blood. Should I starve myself? Will you feed me? 
If I don’t capture your people, how will I mate? God decreed that my race wouldn’t have females. Will you have children for me?” 
These words. 
Immediately caused a moment of silence. Charles II and his men wanted to say something, but the words seemed stuck in their throats. 
Lin Tian added, “By stopping us, are you defying God’s will? Such audacity!” 
“Damn!” 
The humans staggered, nearly losing their balance. 
They had no idea how to refute. 
Indeed, the god who created goblins made them eat flesh and blood and mate with other species’ females. 
In a sense, stopping the goblins was defying God’s will. 
Even the cardinal was speechless, looking a bit flustered, “That’s sophistry! Since there’s nothing more to say, let’s fight!!!”
