Chapter 172: Having a Point Doesn’t Mean You’re Off the Hook (Tang Niu’s Inequality) 
TL: Sungmin 
All two hundred Titan Killers perished under the overwhelming attack. 
This sudden, incomprehensible, and unacceptable turn of events left the people of Landau dumbfounded. 
They were already bewildered by the sheer size of the massive army. What on earth was going on, with so many monsters appearing so suddenly? 
“Could it be… they were forcefully teleported here? But how could that even be possible?!” 
The people of Landau were still preoccupied with figuring out why there was such a large army. 
They didn’t even dare to think about what might become of them! 
Tulan and another Perfect Titan Warrior had already given up on resisting. 
They scrambled to Lin Tian and his group, crawling on all fours. “We surrender! We surrender, alright?” 
The surroundings fell into sudden silence. 
Tulan looked at the hideous, menacing Goblin who was actually riding on a centaur. 
He quickly lowered his head, not daring to make eye contact with Lin Tian. 
His heart pounded wildly in his chest. 
He pressed his forehead hard against the ground, praying for his life. 
Even though Lin Tian hadn’t said a word or lifted a finger. 
Such immense pressure made the once proud and invincible Perfect Titan fall to his knees and beg for mercy. 
He didn’t even consider whether he could fight against Lin Tian. 
That terrifying aura had already scared him out of his wits. 
Millions of troops, thundering steel machines, and ancient dragons filled the sky. 
Any one of them could easily crush him. 
Seeing this, Landau, still sitting in his wheelchair, cursed loudly, “What are you doing?! You are Perfect Titan Warriors, painstakingly cultivated by the War Empire, and you dare to kneel before monsters! Get up and fight! Cover my escape! Run… run…” 
As he spoke, he realized there was no one left by his side. 
Alone, he could barely even get out of the wheelchair. 
“What do you know, you worthless fool? This man here is not someone you or I can provoke! He… he is a phenomenon!!” 
Tulan turned and cursed, showing a completely different face from the one he showed to Lin Tian. 
But in that glance, he noticed Ruen from the Dragon-Slayer Guild, and his heart almost stopped! 
Ruen glared at him fiercely but said nothing. 
He felt it wasn’t his place to speak here. 
Tulan sensed trouble, “My lord, I was only following orders from the War Empire. I have no personal grudge against the Dragon-Slayer Guild, please spare me. Honestly, I was quite happy when Patrick was killed by the Dragon-Slayer Guild. That guy was always so arrogant…” 
“Yes, yes! We can still talk things over, great Goblin Majesty! The real mastermind behind everything is actually Alexander!” 
The other Perfect Titan Warrior also pleaded for mercy. 
They had no fondness for Alexander either. Becoming a Perfect Titan Warrior required tremendous effort—it wasn’t a gift. 
Watching them behave like this, Ruen found it hard to believe. These two powerful beings, who only the One-Eyed Owl could rival, were now kneeling before Lin Tian like slaves. 
They had lost all dignity, begging only to survive. 
Looking down at them, Lin Tian finally spoke, “You know, you make some pretty good points.” 
“Yes, yes! Great Goblin Majesty! Your wisdom is unparalleled. Can I follow you?” Tulan, now groveling, spoke with a sycophantic tone. 
Even Fiona felt disgusted. 
But this was human nature. What was groveling compared to survival? Some people would even eat feces to live. 
In comparison, this was easy. 
However, Lin Tian’s gaze turned cold, and he said slowly, “You do make a lot of sense, but… did you not realize who I am?” 
“You… you are the great Goblin Majesty.”  
Tulan’s heart pounded, his voice growing weaker. 
A vague sense of terror and panic began to rise. 
Lin Tian’s lips curled into a sinister smile, “You’re right. I am a Goblin, and while you make sense, it doesn’t mean I’ll let you go.” 
Such a juicy experience pack—how could he pass it up? 
He was only at level one hundred and still far from reaching one hundred and five. Otherwise, Anubis’ Soul Drain would be wasted. 
“Goblin Majesty, please listen to me, I…” 
Before Tulan could finish, Fiona’s spear pierced his throat! 
Fast, precise, and deadly! 
Blood spurted several meters into the air. 
“Ugh… you lunatic! Damn Goblin, we’ll fight you to the death!” 
Tulan clutched his throat, staggering back, his expression twisted in pain. 
In an instant! 
A bolt of lightning struck. 
The two of them instantly transformed into Perfect Titan Warriors, their roars deafening! 
But it was nothing more than a futile struggle. 
Instead, it only excited the goblins, dwarves, dragons, and other monsters into a frenzy. 
Two titans, sixty to seventy meters tall, appeared in the city. However… 
Compared to the ancient dragons in the sky, they were nothing more than insects. 
The primary purpose of Perfect Titan Warriors was merely to clear out large numbers of small fry; their combat strength was purely based on their size. 
In terms of size, how could they possibly compare to the ancient dragons? 
Immediately, a group of dragons swarmed them, and the dwarves’ steel war machines fired nitrate bombs. 
Blood splattered everywhere! 
Bill watched from the side, full of disdain. “Hmph, these so-called Perfect Titan Warriors from the War Empire, how dare they call themselves that? True ancient Titans were towering figures, reaching tens of thousands of meters tall, standing between heaven and earth!” 
The gods worshipped in this country were the twelve Olympian gods. 
The ancient Titans, like the twelve gods, had actually existed. 
And one of them was Kronos, the father of Zeus, the king of the gods. 
“It’s just that they managed to decipher one of the countless runes and created the Titan transformation magic, but even that is quite remarkable.” Adele added. 
The dwarves had a long heritage and were relatively knowledgeable about such matters. 
Lin Tian was slightly surprised; it seemed this dwarf knew quite a bit too. He thought it might be worth asking her later about Goblin evolution and the matter of Goblin deities. 
At this moment, 
Tulan and the others were already covered in wounds! 
The dragons’ claws, as large as machetes to an ordinary person, tore bloody gashes across their bodies, revealing even their bones! 
With each breath, one could see their internal organs moving inside their chests! 
It was utterly horrifying. 
“Stop… stop, Goblin Majesty, please spare me! I’ll kneel before the Dragon-Slayer Guild and apologize. I won’t dare cross you again, I beg you, it hurts so much!” Tulan’s despairing wails echoed through the city. 
But the dragons had no intention of stopping. 
They circled back and forth, diving down to claw at their prey. 
Little Black, one of the dragons, exerted too much force, crushing the massive head, over ten meters in size, into a pulp! 
Piaji! 
Brains splattered everywhere! 
The other Titan Warrior was scared out of his mind! He tried to run away. 
Adele put on her goggles and gave an order, “Exterminate the enemy!” 
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh! 
In an instant, dozens to hundreds of nitrate bombs flew over, enhanced with explosive magic. 
Their power was far beyond that of simple homemade bombs. 
The Titan Warrior’s back was riddled with bloody holes! 
His entire back was blown open. 
His internal organs were reduced to a sticky paste, spilling all over the ground. 
His massive body stiffened, then crashed down with a thunderous thud. 
“No! Somebody, save me!” 
Landau, perched on the high wall, was so terrified that he unleashed his latent potential! He scrambled and crawled, leaping out of his wheelchair. 
The Titan Warrior’s body nearly crushed him into a meat paste. 
Just when he thought he’d survived, he realized that a pair of sinister, blood-red eyes was staring right into his face. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but wonder, “Should I say you’re incredibly lucky or just short-lived? To survive all this, you’re neither human nor ghost. Even I find it terrifying.” 
Landau, on the verge of collapse, screamed hysterically, “Ahh! Get away! Get away, you damn monster! Don’t come near me! I’m a Duke! A noble!” 
“Hmph, take me to the people you’ve imprisoned.” Lin Tian gave him a kick and ordered. 
But Landau kept screaming, “I’m a Duke! Kneel before me! You lowly monsters, don’t come near me!” 
Seeing him in this crazed state, 
Lin Tian grew impatient and stomped down, crushing his hand. 
In an instant, Landau could do nothing but scream in agony, nearly losing control of his bowels, his hand glued to the ground, too scared to pull away. 
If he did, he would lose it entirely. 
He was on the verge of tears, “Why… why did you step on me…” 
“I’ll ask you one more time, where are the people you’ve imprisoned?” 
Upon hearing this, 
Landau continued to mumble to himself. 
Lin Tian stomped down again, pinning both of his hands to the ground, making it impossible for him to lift them. 
Then, 
Lin Tian placed his foot on Landau’s leg. “If you want to stay here forever, I can arrange that…” 
“No, I’ll tell you where they are…” 
Finally, the pain brought Landau back to his senses. 
But Ruen spoke up, “Uh, I also know where the dungeon is. Big Sis and the others must be locked up in there.” 
“What? Why didn’t you say so earlier?” 
Lin Tian was caught between laughter and tears. 
Landau’s face twisted with rage as he snarled, “You damn bastard! If you’d said that sooner, would I be in this miserable state?” 
Just moments ago, his mind had been on the brink of madness, and he had understood Lin Tian’s words, but his mouth responded differently. 
Ruen snorted coldly, “I wanted to see you suffer like this.” 
With that, Lin Tian lifted him up and headed towards the dungeon. 
The others followed closely behind, eager to see what kind of friends Lin Tian had. 
Upon reaching the dungeon entrance, Lin Tian kicked the door down. 
From a distance, he saw the One-Eyed Owl, pinned to the ground by a spear under the dim light. 
Ruen immediately shouted, “Big Sis! You’re still alive, thank goodness! The rookie who joined the guild back then has come to rescue you!” 
He circled around the One-Eyed Owl, unsure of what to do. 
Seeing the One-Eyed Owl in such a weakened state but still holding on, Lin Tian couldn’t help but feel a pang of sorrow. 
He tossed Landau aside, “Support her.” 
Ruen quickly complied. 
Lin Tian then sliced the spear in half and pulled the remaining shaft from the One-Eyed Owl’s body. For now, this was all he could do. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s expression twitched slightly, and then, wobbling, she stood up. 
She began walking forward. 
From start to finish, she didn’t utter a single word, resembling a soulless husk. 
“Huh? Big Sis, what are you doing?”  
Ruen looked completely bewildered. 
The One-Eyed Owl slowly approached the nearby figure of Landau, who was lying on the ground like a broken man. 
Seeing her covered in blood, Landau was terrified and equally confused. “W-what are you doing? Stay away from me! I’m a Duke…” 
“A Duke, huh?!” 
Smack! 
On the spot! 
The One-Eyed Owl, enduring her pain, swung her fist straight at Landau’s face. 
In an instant, his entire face caved in, and the teeth that were knocked loose embedded themselves into the bloody flesh of his mouth. 
Blood quickly filled Landau’s mouth, choking off his cries of pain. “You… glurk… stop it!” 
“This guy must be crazy. First, he tells people not to come near him, and now he’s begging them to stop. It’s almost laughable,”  
Ruen couldn’t help but remark. Now that the One-Eyed Owl was safe, the weight on his mind had lifted. 
… 
TL: Tang Niu’s Inequality—a meme on the Chinese internet. I think it originated when a girl accepted a guy’s gift (like a confessional gift?), but that didn’t mean she agreed to date him. Many other feminists came out in support of it, thus the term was coined.
