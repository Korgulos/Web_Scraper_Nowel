Chapter 251: What? Justice is Actually Me! 
TL: Sungmin 
“This move is indeed powerful, but I already told you—physical attacks are useless against me!” Scarlett said proudly, restoring herself to her previous state. 
“Swish!” 
In the blink of an eye, a dazzling golden sword qi slashed out! 
Even the fabric of space seemed to tear apart! 
It split Scarlett directly in two. 
The dark night lit up with a blinding radiance. 
This time, it was a pure Holy Light magic attack, completely countering the soul-eating creature, leaving it no chance to regenerate. 
It died instantly. 
Scarlett never would have thought she’d meet her end so swiftly, so decisively! 
If only she hadn’t boasted about her immunity to physical attacks! 
But alas, anyone who believes they’re invincible will always reveal their hand—such is human nature. 
Alice stood there, holding her ominous blade, her gaze filled with cold resolve. 
There was also an unspoken, striking grace that only a true swordsman possessed. 
This time, all that training hadn’t been wasted. 
She had fully mastered her strength, her combat power rating soaring past twenty thousand. 
One could say she was now the most formidable single combatant in the Uninhabited Zone. 
“Whoa, whoa, whoa! What happened here? Has Lady Alice gotten this strong in just a few days? It’s giving me that unsettling feeling again!” said the One-Eyed Owl, who had rushed over, arriving just in time to witness the scene, feeling a chill run through her. 
That feeling you get when facing an opponent against whom you have absolutely no chance. 
Osius and the others watched in utter fascination, their eyes filled with admiration. “So beautiful, so powerful, so gallant! My goddess, Lady Alice!” 
Even the watching monsters and demi-humans were chanting Alice’s name. 
“Oh, how lucky His Majesty is! If Lady Alice would just look at me with favor once, I’d die happy!” 
“Those eyes of hers, they just leave me groveling like a dog!” 
“As expected of my goddess!” 
“Long live Lady Alice!!!” 
However— 
Alice remained composed, though a hint of surprise flashed in her beautiful eyes. “Your Majesty, she’s not dead yet.” 
“Whoosh!” 
She said this while leaping quickly across the rooftops! 
In a flash, she charged toward Scarlett, who had reverted to her original form! 
“World-Class Magic! Otherworldly Mist!” 
“Shhh!” 
Scarlett conjured several magic circles, and in the blink of an eye, a dense mist burst forth! 
Her entire body vanished within it. 
And this mist spread over dozens of kilometers, soon covering a significant portion of the Goblin Empire. 
Lin Tian furrowed his brows. “Damn! How did I forget about this!” 
Indeed, fighting someone of a Great Demon King’s caliber was no easy feat. Each powerful move was followed by another, and they were all incredibly clever! 
They knew precisely how to use and combine their skills. 
After thousands of years, their skill proficiency far exceeded the norm. 
The demi-human and monster spectators were taken aback by this thick fog. 
But soon, the mist began to dissipate. 
And with the mist, Scarlett had also disappeared. 
Alice said coolly, “I’ll pursue her!” 
“I’ll go too. There are so many people outside; with more of us, it’ll be easier to track her down!” suggested the One-Eyed Owl and others. 
Lin Tian, however, raised a hand to stop them. “No, she definitely hasn’t fled outside the city. She’s not that foolish, nor would she just let this go…” 
Humiliated in front of everyone, furious beyond reason. 
There’s no way Scarlett would back down without killing him. 
After all, the opponent was a Great Demon King who had lived for thousands of years—someone who never practiced restraint. 
Among the crowd of demi-humans and monsters on the streets and rooftops— 
Scarlett had already disguised herself as a male long-armed ape, blending into the crowd. 
Coldly, she thought to herself, “So, you guessed right. If I don’t kill you today, I won’t return to the Uninhabited Zone! No one can save you!” 
At that moment, Alice spoke up. “So, she’s transformed into one of the other demi-humans or monsters in the crowd, and we can’t tell who…” 
“Why would we need to tell them apart?” 
Lin Tian’s eyes narrowed, filled with icy resolve as he surveyed the hundreds of demi-humans and monsters gathering to watch. 
Though he’d always worked hard to maintain his image, never letting others think of him as a tyrant— 
The truth was, he’d never claimed to be a good person. 
And now, the Uninhabited Zone was entirely his. 
What was it to kill a few hundred demi-humans and monsters? 
If he wanted, he could wipe them all out. 
Instantly, a large number of goblins gathered, surrounding all the demi-humans and monsters present. 
Upon seeing this, the demi-humans and monsters were horrified, every hair standing on end. 
Something wasn’t right. 
“Your Majesty, what-what does this mean?! I’m not an enemy! I came as soon as your empire opened up!” 
“Don’t kill me! I’m your loyal fan, Your Majesty! You can’t just slaughter innocents; that’s far too cruel!” 
“A tyrant! I thought you were a good person, but now you’re going to commit indiscriminate slaughter? Despicable!” 
“I’ll haunt you even in death! Damn goblin!!!” 
“I don’t want to die, please! Your Majesty, spare me, I’m begging you!” 
In an instant, the surrounded demi-humans and monsters spoke up. 
Some begged for mercy, while others, resigned, cursed openly. 
They knew Lin Tian’s ways all too well. 
They understood there was no chance of survival. 
Lin Tian’s gaze swept over them, his eyes devoid of hesitation or doubt. 
If he didn’t eliminate Scarlett now, he’d be placing himself in grave danger. 
She would no longer try to enslave his soul; she’d aim to kill him outright. 
Who could sleep soundly with an enemy who could transform into one’s bedfellow? 
He gave the command, “Alice, do it.” 
“Mm,” Alice responded calmly, channeling holy energy into the Ominous Blade. 
The light grew brighter, like the grim reaper’s scythe gleaming in the darkness. 
The crowd of demi-humans and monsters sobbed in terror, dropping to their knees and pleading for mercy, their cries heart-wrenching. 
Lin Tian barely registered their pleas. “I’m still being merciful, you see. Letting Alice handle you all means you won’t feel pain when you die.” 
“Despicable beast!!” came the anguished, despairing cries. 
“Swish!” 
With a swift motion, a radiant sword qi infused with holy power slashed forth! 
It cleaved through hundreds of demi-humans and monsters, severing them at the waist. 
Blood sprayed into the air, a fountain of crimson rising several meters high. 
Even the nearby goblin soldiers were not spared. 
The severed bodies on the ground stared at Lin Tian with venomous, resentful eyes, their gazes unblinking in death. 
Lin Tian, however, paid them no mind. 
Instead, he surveyed the corpses of the demi-humans and monsters, confirming they were all dead. 
From afar, other demi-humans and monsters watching this scene felt an icy fear pierce their spines; without a second thought, they turned and fled, not daring to come near. 
The One-Eyed Owl clicked her tongue and remarked, “You’ve got quite the ruthless streak, huh? But I like this way of handling things! Direct and brutal! So, did you manage to kill her?” 
“Hsss—” 
In the pile of corpses, white smoke rose from the body of an ape-like demi-human. 
Slowly, it morphed back into Scarlett’s form—now split in two! 
Her face twisted in pain and fury. “You! You maniac! Pervert! Tyrant! I thought we Demon Lords were brutal enough, but you’re the real demon! You even kill your own kind?!” 
Blood trickled continuously from her mouth as she spoke. 
“How can a monster like you exist in this world? I swear, I will kill you. Not just for revenge—but for the peace and stability of the world! You evil goblin!” 
“Sshhh!” 
Mist billowed forth again! 
Clinging to her last breath, Scarlett activated *Boundless Lust*, transforming into a winged magical creature and hurtling toward the Uninhabited Zone. 
Her body, for the moment, reformed completely. 
But her severe injuries would soon render the spell ineffective, and she’d revert to two severed halves unless someone healed her. 
Her destination, however, was the other Lords of Sin. 
“I’ll make you witness the true power of a Sin Lord!” 
Among the Seven Great Demon Kings, her combat strength was actually the weakest, as she was never truly skilled in battle.
