Chapter 204: The Birth of the Holy Tree Goblin! 
TL: Sungmin  
Countless massive vines extended outward, like towering hills. 
It was incredibly shocking! 
They blocked the advancing magic puppets. 
Immediately, a dozen vines tightly coiled around the three-headed dragon, like pythons winding their prey! 
The sound of tension could be heard. 
Even the Elephant King felt pressure. “What’s going on? Why does this Holy Tree feel stronger than before?” 
Before his eyes, tens of thousands of roots spread out like menacing, flailing tentacles, eerie yet powerful. 
Moreover, the strength far surpassed what it used to be. 
In just moments, the dragon let out a pitiful wail as the vines tightened. 
“Boom!” 
It shattered into pieces, crumbling like stone, scattering across the ground. 
The Giant Elephant Empire King quickly leaped away, pulling out a magical doll in midair. “Puppet Magic · Hellwalker!” 
Right then. 
A massive thousand-meter puppet emerged, with three heads and six arms, resembling the demonic form of a wrathful Nezha! 
It was engulfed in hellfire! 
The Holy Tree King remained composed. “Tree, our puppets are no worse than his!” 
“Swish, swish, swish!” 
Roots intertwined, forming a massive puppet made of trees over a thousand meters tall! 
The war reached a fever pitch. 
Both sides were locked in an intense battle, the deafening booms echoed continuously, leaving a stunning impact. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but look back at the Holy Tree. “No wonder they claim it’s unbeatable at home. I didn’t expect it to be this tough!” 
“Indeed. Even our Troy Empire wouldn’t dare invade so recklessly,” Sara added. 
These two empires were recognized in the wilderness as the most defensible and most aggressive—essentially, the strongest shield against the strongest spear. 
The clash was extraordinary. 
From a visual standpoint, Lin Tian was witnessing such a battle for the first time, utterly awe-struck. 
An army of millions paled in comparison to this. 
At that moment. 
The puppet of the tree-man was burned to ash by the Hellwalker’s flames! 
But in the next second. 
Massive roots burst from the ground, binding the Hellwalker’s limbs, making it unable to move. 
“Attack, Holy Tree Warriors!” 
Soldiers clad in light armor climbed onto the Hellwalker’s chest. 
They opened a hatch, crawling inside to find a core emitting a blue magical glow. 
Using the Holy Tree’s spears, they ruthlessly destroyed it. 
Such a powerful Hellwalker immediately turned into an ordinary stone statue. 
Unable to bear its weight, it began to crumble. 
Seeing this. 
The Elephant King roared in anger, “Don’t push me into a corner!” 
He immediately activated three more thousand-meter-tall magic puppets! 
These wielded weapons, much like the Grim Reaper, slicing through the tree roots in massive swaths with their giant scythes! 
Clearly, they were designed specifically to counter the Holy Tree Empire. 
As the battle dragged on, casualties on both sides became immense! 
Many puppets collapsed, and countless Holy Tree soldiers perished. 
Before long. 
Victory began tilting toward the Giant Elephant Empire, breaking through the Holy Tree Empire’s first line of defense, forcing them back into the city. 
“World-Class Magic · Wall of the Holy Tree!” 
The Holy Tree King urgently unleashed his power, forming a thousand-meter-tall wall of vegetation to block the puppet army’s advance. 
It temporarily halted the Giant Elephant Empire’s assault. 
Yet, the Holy Tree’s aura was dimming, its leaves falling like the desolation of autumn, casting a gloomy and tragic scene. 
It could no longer fight with its roots. 
If this continued, the tree itself would wither. 
With more than half the soldiers lost, only a few hundred thousand remained. In the end, the strongest shield could not withstand the strongest spear. 
Hearing the soldiers’ fearful and pained cries, the Holy Tree King’s face twisted with reluctance. “Tree, can’t you save us?” 
The tree remained silent. 
Suddenly, a fierce wind arose. 
Leaves, once shading the sky, now fell in great numbers! 
“Swish, swish, swish, swish!” 
The scene was incredibly shocking—so many leaves fell that for a moment, no one could see anything in front of them. There was only an endless downpour of leaves. 
The leaves piled up high, filling half the city! 
Even outside, the fallen leaves accumulated like snow, making movement nearly impossible. 
“Hahaha! What a joke of a Holy Tree! So many roots chopped off, it looks like it’s going to wither soon! Keep attacking! Break through that tree wall!”  
The Elephant King laughed arrogantly, standing atop his puppet, savoring the wind carrying the falling leaves. 
This was the taste of victory! 
The sound of the leaves colliding in the wind was the melody of triumph! 
As the last leaf fell. 
Only clusters of black fruits remained on the now bare branches. 
The Holy Tree King stood below, looking up, his face twitching, filled with confusion and terror. “Tree, what—what is happening?! Could it be that the Holy Tree Empire is about to meet its end? I beg you, help us!” 
He knelt beneath the tree, praying desperately. 
Prayer could indeed summon miracles. 
“Boom! Boom! Boom!” 
Outside, the Giant Elephant Empire relentlessly pounded the tree wall, each strike like a heavy blow to their hearts. 
Lin Tian’s expression was complicated. “Looks like it’s time to clean up the aftermath.” 
Though he didn’t fully understand what was happening with the Holy Tree, when the Giant Elephant Empire broke through, after a final desperate struggle, both sides would be severely weakened. 
There was still time to retreat and send reinforcements. 
There were no other empires nearby to seize the opportunity, and it would take any army about ten days to arrive. 
Even if given twenty days, the Giant Elephant Empire wouldn’t have time to recover its strength. 
“Wait, Your Majesty, look at the fruits on the tree. Something seems… to be moving!”  
Suddenly, Sara stopped him, her beautiful eyes filled with astonishment as she looked at the Holy Tree. 
The black fruits, each the size of two basketballs, were indeed writhing with something inside. 
“Pop…” 
A fruit dropped from the branch, landing on the ground. 
Curious villagers couldn’t resist approaching to inspect it. “A fruit from the Holy Tree?! Can we eat it? Will eating it give us divine power?” 
“I don’t know. Wait, there seems to be something inside!” 
“Look, it’s coming out!” 
The black fruit split open from the inside, a large amount of black liquid oozing out, followed by a strange creature rolling out! 
It had black-green skin, stood just over a meter tall, and its blood-red eyes gleamed with a sinister light! 
With sharp teeth and claws, it was utterly terrifying! 
“Goblin!!” 
The villagers were shocked. 
But this was different from a typical goblin—its legs were covered with what looked like root-like tendrils. 
Seeing the humans, the goblin suddenly leapt at them, tearing into their flesh. The sound of ripping skin and bone, along with agonized screams, filled the air! 
Terrified, the other villagers fled in panic! 
But they hadn’t gotten far before— 
Another black fruit dropped from the sky, and another goblin burst forth, roaring as it lunged at them! 
“Swish, swish, swish!” 
Countless fruits began to fall, like a torrential black rain! 
It was despair, suffocating and inescapable! 
The entire city, at least a million newly born goblins, swept across it, devouring anyone they encountered on sight, tearing them apart instantly! 
Because of the tree wall. 
Many people had no place to flee. They could only watch in horror as goblins ripped off their arms and bit through the necks of their loved ones! 
The scene left the Holy Tree King dumbfounded. “Goblins?! Why are there so many goblins growing from the Holy Tree?! Impossible, am I dreaming?!” 
This scene was incomprehensible, unbelievable. 
No one could accept it! 
The city descended into complete chaos and death! 
Even the soldiers couldn’t resist the goblins’ onslaught—they were all slaughtered. 
Before the Giant Elephant Empire even made it inside, the city was already on the verge of total destruction! 
“Damn it, why are there goblins here?! What is this?!” 
The Holy Tree King’s face was full of fear. Trembling, he staggered backward, tripping on the stairs and falling to the ground. 
He had thought it was a divine miracle. 
But this was a divine punishment! 
The stench of blood and the sinister laughter of the goblins echoed throughout the city. 
He had lost all hope, and the will to resist had completely abandoned him. 
“Boom!” 
At that moment. 
The tree wall was finally breached by the Giant Elephant King. “Charge in! Leave no one alive! I will make them pay!” 
A massive wave of Giant Elephant soldiers surged inside. 
However. 
They were met by a crowd of fleeing citizens. 
“Hmph, is it really this desperate? They’re sending ordinary civilians to fight us?”  
The Giant Elephant King sneered. 
But then, something seemed wrong. 
Behind the citizens were countless goblins! 
“What’s going on?! Goblins?! Where did the Holy Tree Empire get so many goblins?! Prepare for battle!”  
The Elephant King was astonished, immediately issuing orders. 
The soldiers were bewildered by the sudden development, and in their confusion, they were quickly overwhelmed by the goblins! 
What’s more, these goblins grew stronger the more they ate, evolving into hero variants and even leader variants! 
They could absorb nutrients from the earth and the Holy Tree’s power through the root-like tendrils on their bodies. 
The Giant Elephant soldiers stood no chance. 
They were overwhelmingly slaughtered and devoured. 
Seeing this, the Elephant King realized the danger. “Quick, send the puppets around to flank those goblins!” 
“Yes, sir!” 
The puppets began to move. 
They couldn’t afford to fail here because of a horde of goblins. 
Indeed. 
Once the puppets entered the fray, the tide began to turn. 
These goblins, though incredibly vicious and powerful, were no match for the puppets. 
With just a single stomp. 
Hundreds, if not thousands, of goblins were crushed. 
It was only a matter of time before they were completely wiped out. 
At this moment. 
Lin Tian was just as stunned. “Am I seeing things? There are so many goblins here?!” 
He found it unbelievable. 
Out of nowhere, the Holy Tree had somehow given birth to such an overwhelming number of goblins. 
It was truly unexpected. 
Sara pondered and said, “Your Majesty, do you remember the request you made when we first entered the city?” 
“I remember… Wait, what?! Am I really that awesome?!” 
Suddenly, Lin Tian realized what had happened. 
The tree spirit was the embodiment of the Holy Tree. 
Because he was a goblin, he possessed a special ability—no reproductive isolation with any living creature. 
But he had never thought this would apply to plants too! 
The fact that even a tree could… 
He had to admit, he was truly something else. 
“I get it now. Looks like this is an incredible stroke of luck!” Lin Tian couldn’t help but exclaim. 
Quickly, he shifted back to his original form and shouted loudly, “All goblins, hear my command! Stop attacking humans, and instead climb onto those magic puppets. Target the magic cores at their center!!!” 
His voice. 
It was as though it carried the force of a command within a program! 
All the goblins froze upon hearing it, then turned in unison to look at Lin Tian.
