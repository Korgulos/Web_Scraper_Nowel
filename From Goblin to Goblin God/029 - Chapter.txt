Chapter 29: Blocking the Bridge, Total Annihilation! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Why is there a dragon here? Wait, look quickly at the dragon’s back! It’s a goblin! Goblins can ride dragons!? How is this possible?” 
The leader of the Battle Roar Regiment couldn’t help but exclaim. This kind of thing was unprecedented! 
It was probably the first time in history that goblins had been seen riding dragons! 
Lin Tian looked at them coldly and couldn’t help but praise, “Hehe, you guys are really quick, repairing the bridge so fast, not bad, not bad.” 
After saying this, he even clapped his hands. 
The leader of the Battle Roar Regiment immediately took out a large axe from his back, “You’re the goblin who captured Lord Loder, right? I’ll kill…!” 
Before he could finish speaking, his words got stuck in his throat. 
Because that wyvern had opened its huge mouth, with a blazing fire gathering inside! 
“Dragon Flame!” 
At Lin Tian’s command, the dragon immediately spewed out a huge flame, spraying towards the Battle Roar Regiment members. 
Facing the incoming sea of fire, they even abandoned their horses and ran back! 
Turning a horse around took too long; they would have been roasted by then. 
Everyone stumbled and fell, but at least they weren’t turned into roast duck. 
When they turned and saw the newly built wooden bridge behind them, they were all furious, angrily drawing their weapons! 
After going through all kinds of hardships to build the bridge, it was now charred again! 
“Damned bastard!” 
“Get him!” 
“Slay the dragon! Capture that goblin and torture him to death! Aaargh!” 
Each of them was filled with extreme hatred, wanting to retaliate. 
Suddenly, a rhythmic rumbling sound came from behind! 
Everyone felt a tightness in their hearts! 
The Battle Roar Captain quickly turned around, only to find that a large number of goblins had surrounded them at some point! 
It was Gobu Kuang and his group. 
There were about thirty big goblins and a few lurking goblin assassins. 
“Everyone, prepare for battle! Here comes a big one!” The leader of the Battle Roar Regiment said cautiously. 
A regiment leader with a heavy expression said, “Commander, it seems we’ve been targeted for a while now. These goblins are definitely not simple!” 
First, the bridge was destroyed, and now they were being ambushed! 
Everyone understood and knew they were in dire straits! 
After all, even the Silver Blade Regiment was annihilated, and Kasimov was dead. 
They had no absolute confidence in handling this. 
“That tall one must be the Goblin Hero. I’ll take care of him! Bain, you’re an assassin, fast, go find the Sword Saintess!” 
The Battle Roar Captain charged with his axe, clearing a path for Bain. 
Wearing light armor, Bain nodded forcefully, “Commander, hold on!” 
He leapt into the trees, discarding his armor and weapons to maximize his speed. 
Seeing him trying to escape, several lurking goblin assassins were about to take action. 
Lin Tian’s voice rang out, “Let him go. Focus on dealing with the rest.” 
“Ahh!” 
At this moment, the Battle Roar Captain let out a powerful, shocking roar! This increased his attribute values and attack power significantly! 
However, Gobu Kuang was not to be outdone, roaring as well, though it had no effect. 
Holding a black iron longsword, he slashed forward! 
“Clang!” 
A piercing metallic clash erupted immediately! 
And a strong gust of wind! 
The surrounding shrubs were blown to one side, giving them a “side-swept” hairstyle. 
The Battle Roar Captain’s face changed slightly, “You actually have similar strength to me! This sword, isn’t it Kasimov’s? It seems I was right…” 
“I like your axe. Give it to me!” 
Gobu Kuang sneered coldly, reaching out with his extra hands to grab it. 
The Battle Roar Captain hurriedly retreated, only to suddenly notice a figure emerging from the bushes! 
It leaped up and slashed! 
“Splurt!” 
Green goo splattered everywhere! 
A goblin assassin’s head was directly smashed! 
Due to his high attack power, he could instantly kill the fragile goblin assassin. 
Across the bridge, Lin Tian’s expression turned sinister, “You, you can do anything, but why kill the goblins I painstakingly raised?” 
Saying this, he slowly raised his left hand, adjusting the Elemental Hand Crossbow to wind element. 
This was the power absorbed while riding the dragon. 
It was perfect for testing the effect on him. 
Since it was a sneak attack, he could charge it up. 
“Whoosh!” 
A wind sphere burst out instantly! The sound of breaking through the air was incessant! 
It forcibly caused the other regiment members along the way to have their heads shaken. 
“Commander! Watch out!” 
Unfortunately, even with a warning, it was too late. The Battle Roar Captain wasn’t a speed-type knight, and it was difficult to dodge with his large axe. 
“Boom!” 
The wind sphere exploded, sending him flying several meters away. 
He spat out a mouthful of blood. 
Seeing this effect, Lin Tian was somewhat surprised, “Oh wow, internal injuries? This wind element is very effective against high-defense enemies.” 
Unlike fire and poison arrows, even if you were wearing armor, it could cause massive shock damage. 
“That damned little goblin! How can he use such terrifying attacks!” 
The Battle Roar Captain cursed as he got up and ordered, “Kill the one riding the dragon first! I feel he’s the leader!” 
“Yes!” The members understood. 
The mage among them began chanting, “Mid-tier Magic·Song of Battle! Mid-tier Magic·Domain Capture!” 
A loud and majestic song rang out, maximizing the strength of all members! 
Moreover, Domain Capture greatly expanded everyone’s skill range! 
It was extremely powerful. 
This was exactly what the Battle Roar Captain wanted, “Let’s die together! High-tier Skill·Lion’s Roar!” 
“Roar!” 
A visible red ring-shaped shockwave shot straight at Lin Tian! 
It immobilized him and the wyvern. 
It was a control-type skill, and even if one had a control immunity skill, it would take five seconds to break free. 
No matter how hard the wyvern flapped its wings, it couldn’t move. 
“Hmph, you’re dead! Mid-tier Martial Skill·Deadly Flying Axe!” 
The Battle Roar Captain coldly smiled and threw his flying axe at Lin Tian’s head! 
If that large axe hit the head, it would split it open! 
Lin Tian was slightly surprised; this guy’s combo was brainless and violent! 
If he were playing a game, he would definitely choose this type. 
However, choosing physical attacks was their biggest mistake! 
Just as the flying axe was about to strike, Lin Tian activated the skill ‘No-Blade Capture’! 
The axe seemed to pass through Lin Tian’s body, not cutting it but penetrating it! 
“Impossible!” 
The Battle Roar Captain’s eyes almost popped out! 
How could there be something so absurd! 
The other members felt like they had seen a ghost, “What kind of monster is that little goblin! Commander, we’ve hit a hard wall this time!” 
“Damn it, no time to chat, help me!” 
The Battle Roar Captain’s heart rate skyrocketed because Gobu Kuang was charging at him madly! 
Without a weapon, how could he block? 
But with a thought, he could still control the flying axe to return. 
“Ouch!” 
In the distance, Lin Tian cried out in pain as the returning axe hit his head, causing a big bump. 
The Battle Roar Captain laughed triumphantly, “Haha! Look at that little bastard’s mess! He’s got a big bump on his head!” 
He retrieved the large axe and swung it at Gobu Kuang, and they fell into a standoff. 
Or rather, a test of strength. 
Gobu Kuang’s eyes were full of disdain, “Frenzied Power!” 
He activated the skill, all four arms pressing on the weapon, muscles visibly swelling, veins popping! 
“Damn! I can’t hold on, guys!” 
The Battle Roar Captain’s veins bulged, and large beads of sweat dripped from his forehead. 
The sound of muscles tearing was crackling! 
But he still couldn’t withstand Gobu Kuang’s strength and watched helplessly as the axe blade got closer to his body! 
The drawback of a double-sided axe was apparent. 
If you couldn’t outmatch in strength, the other side of the axe would cut you. 
As he turned his head, he saw that the other members couldn’t help because Lin Tian was constantly harassing with sneaky attacks. 
Some were already dead! 
“Argh!” 
“Why is this beast so strong?! Can a hero variant reach this level?!” 
The Battle Roar Captain was about to give in, watching the axe blade cut into his shoulder! 
And it wasn’t stopping! 
Bit by bit, it dug in! 
The pain exploded in his mind! 
It felt like a girl’s first time, the pain of being penetrated bit by bit! 
“Slash!” 
Following that, his arm, along with his shoulder, was cut off! 
Normally, the intense pain would have incapacitated him. 
Fortunately, adrenaline kept him moving quickly. 
But he didn’t notice Lin Tian’s dark expression in the distance, “Damn it, this bump on my head isn’t over! I’ll give you two bumps!” 
Lin Tian then charged up the wind element again! 
This time aiming for his head! 
“Whoosh!” 
The wind blast hit directly! 
The Battle Roar Captain lost consciousness and fell to the ground. 
This was the second bump, one on his head and soon a grave on the mountain. 
“Commander!” 
A member’s attention was drawn, filled with anxiety and despair. 
Immediately, a goblin assassin took the opportunity, pierced him with a blade, and killed him! 
Gobu Kuang laughed, “This axe is great, haha! Boss, look at my new weapon!” 
Indeed, the large axe in Gobu Kuang’s hands was even more terrifying. 
He went over and dismembered the Battle Roar Captain. 
He even stomped and burst his bulging eyes. 
The rest were mostly dealt with, though one person escaped initially, which was Lin Tian’s intention. 
“Go, lure the Sword Saintess here, hehe.” 
Lin Tian then instructed, “Don’t eat yet. Gobu Shan, you go first.” 
“Thank you, boss! Thank you!” 
The grateful Gobu Shan knelt and ran to a corpse to feast. 
After finishing one, he still didn’t level up, so he devoured the Battle Roar Captain’s body. 
Finally, he reached level fifty! 
“How is it? Are you evolving?” Lin Tian asked expectantly. 
However, Gobu Shan looked confused, “Boss, I don’t feel anything, I even need to poop.” 
“Damn it! Never mind, we need to leave quickly.” 
Lin Tian rode the wyvern into the sky, surveying the surroundings to plan the best escape route. 
Otherwise, that crazy woman would catch up, and they wouldn’t escape. 
Riding the wyvern was fine for him, but what about the rest? They had worked hard to train, and if she killed them with a few swords, it would be game over.
