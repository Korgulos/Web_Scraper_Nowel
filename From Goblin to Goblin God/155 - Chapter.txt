Chapter 155: Darkspawn vs. Wind Spirit 
Alice’s expression remained cold as she looked behind her. 
She was prepared to eliminate Gobu Kuang and the others together. 
She was merely following Lin Tian’s orders to take over the Kingdom of Swords. 
She had no interest in any one-on-one duels. 
However, Darkspawn egged her on, “Come on, don’t you want to take him down? You were being suppressed by him before, weren’t you?” 
“This time, with me here, I can break down his swordsmanship for you, making you stronger and more useful to the Messenger in the future, isn’t that right?” 
“Go on, become stronger!” 
Hearing this, Alice wavered a little and finally spoke, “I’ll deal with him; you all just stay alert.” 
“That’s more like it. First, listen to my breakdown of his moves. If it really comes to it, then you can use my power,” Darkspawn said slyly. 
Alice slowly walked forward. 
Seeing this, Edward forced himself to stay calm. “Princess Alice, I admit that you outmaneuvered me in terms of strategy, but I won’t lose to you in swordsmanship.” 
“Then, here I come!” 
Edward moved with light steps, using the power of the Wind Spirit to flicker like a phantom to Alice’s left side. 
He knew that Alice wasn’t skilled at using her sword with her left hand. 
Attacking from that side would give him a significant advantage. 
But unfortunately. 
From a distance, Darkspawn saw through it and said, “Step back and watch your left side!” 
Alice, half-doubting, stepped back, adjusting her distance to keep her right hand within striking range. 
Edward was stunned, “How is this possible?! Can he predict my moves?” 
“Shing!” 
The Ominous Blade came crashing down! 
Sword Qi blasted out, carving a funnel-shaped groove several meters deep in the ground ahead, dirt and dust flying everywhere! 
Alice didn’t hold back at all with her attack. She didn’t have to worry about affecting anyone else. 
Edward nimbly dodged and seized the moment of Alice’s attack recovery to move in close and strike. 
The clash of swords rang out. 
Edward gained the upper hand, forcing Alice into constant defense, unable to counterattack. 
She found herself in the same situation as last time. 
She couldn’t break down her opponent’s moves, and the techniques she devised were easily dismantled, like a teacher correcting a student’s work. 
“It’s about time, Princess Alice. You must realize by now that you can’t defeat me!” Edward said sternly, continuing to press his advantage. 
Darkspawn sneered, “Alice, you naive child. Just because you’re a swordsman doesn’t mean you’re only a swordsman. Can’t you use your legs to attack?” 
“But that would dishonor the title of swordsman…” Alice responded in her mind. 
Darkspawn chuckled, “You humans are such strange creatures. Even when you’re about to lose, you still put meaningless pride first. If you insist on that, I can’t help you.” 
Upon hearing this. 
After Alice’s arm was slashed, she could only follow Darkspawn’s advice. 
In the middle of their sword clash, she threw in a knee strike! 
“Ugh!” 
Edward spat out saliva, his face contorted in pain. “You! Sword Technique, Qi Sea Torrent!” 
He immediately used a skill to break free and regain control. 
The Royal Sword hummed and unleashed a powerful aura, which surged forward like a torrent, amplified by the Wind Spirit! 
Alice prepared to use a skill to counter it. 
But Darkspawn stopped her, “Don’t try to counter it. You can withstand this attack with your body and strike back against the flow to deal him a heavy blow!” 
“Against the flow?” Alice still harbored doubts. 
Darkspawn said no more. 
As the torrent of Sword Qi rushed toward her, Alice mustered her courage, gripped the Ominous Blade, and charged straight into it! 
She allowed the Sword Qi to clash against her armor. 
Her body was immediately covered in numerous gashes. 
But it didn’t affect her much; Alice seized the opportunity to dash forward, aiming her sword straight at Edward’s heart! 
“What!” 
Edward was completely caught off guard. His attack had only been a bluff. 
He hadn’t expected it to be seen through. 
It was too late to dodge. 
“Lady Sylph!” Edward hurriedly called for help. 
“Boom!!!” 
A violent gust of wind erupted from him, shooting up into the sky! 
It formed a colossal tornado, twisting the clouds in the sky, a sight to behold! 
The sheer force of it was visually overwhelming! 
The Wind Spirit Sylph, in a form akin to a soul, spread her arms, attaching herself to Edward, her hair flowing wildly in the wind. 
Then, she glanced at Alice and gently waved her hand! 
“Whoosh!” 
A fierce gust, as sharp as a blade, sliced across Alice’s cheek. 
The speed was so fast that there was no chance to evade. 
At that moment, everyone, including the goblins, felt the intense fury of the wind! 
Edward held the Royal Sword, his clothes fluttering in the wind, exuding a powerful aura. He looked down on Alice with disdain and said, “Alice, the speed at which your strength has grown is beyond my expectations, but now you have no chance of winning!” 
The Wind Spirit’s power was unleashed to its fullest. 
He could now use world-class wind magic to assist him. 
“Tell me, who here can possibly stand against me?” Edward arrogantly declared, hovering in mid-air. 
Alice’s expression grew serious as she finally understood the vast difference in their abilities. 
In this state, she had no chance of winning. 
She couldn’t even unleash her Sword Qi properly; any attack would be redirected by the raging winds, potentially striking herself. 
But Alice was not one to give up easily. 
Gripping her longsword, she charged forward quickly! 
“Ignorant…” Edward muttered softly. 
With a swing of his sword, a terrifying gale was unleashed! 
“Boom!” 
The sheer force tore up a massive layer of earth! 
Yet, Alice remained standing, struggling to move forward. 
Seeing this, Edward frowned slightly. “It seems I must make you taste true pain. World-Class Sword Technique · Corridor of Pain!” 
The Royal Sword hummed as he swung it, gathering the winds into a powerful force! 
He slashed forward, creating a corridor of wind and sword energy, several dozen meters wide and stretching hundreds of meters long. 
Gobu Kuang and the others sensed the danger and retreated far away. 
Inside this corridor, the air was filled with rampant Sword Qi. 
Any living being within would be struck repeatedly by countless slashes of wind! 
They might even be torn to pieces. 
However, Alice stood her ground, continually swinging her sword to minimize the damage. 
She mocked him, “Sword Saint, is this what you call a Sword Saint? You’re nothing but a magician relying on magic.” 
In her heart, a true Sword Saint relied solely on close combat, winning with pure swordsmanship. 
Now, Edward was no different from a mage. 
“Hmph, winning is all that matters!” Edward had already resigned himself to using whatever means necessary, focusing only on repelling the goblin army as quickly as possible. 
Suddenly. 
His expression changed drastically. 
He sensed an overwhelming, evil fear growing within the area! 
Even Sylph noticed something was wrong. “She… she has a Darkspawn inside her!” 
“Darkspawn?” Edward immediately realized something, and cold sweat began to form on his forehead. 
Within the Corridor of Pain. 
A massive burst of dark energy exploded, shattering the corridor! 
“Kehehe! This is it! The feeling of being reborn!”  
Alice spoke, but the voice that came out was a sharp, sinister male voice. 
She had reverted to the form she had taken on the Laiyang Plains. 
From the hand holding the sword, half of her body was now covered in black and red flesh, a grotesque and terrifying sight.
