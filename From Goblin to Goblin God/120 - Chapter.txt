Chapter 120: Lonely Person, Lonely Tears · Gobu Kuang 
TL: Sungmin 
Lin Tian, who had been thinking about the affairs of tomorrow, suddenly froze. 
Only then did he notice Katheryn. 
Seeing her vibrant and alluring eyes, he couldn’t help but feel invigorated. 
“Oh, that… I’m still…” 
Lin Tian intended to refuse, as he had been busy until now and hadn’t yet fused a new kidney. 
He wanted to help but felt powerless. 
However, given the current situation, looking at Katheryn now, he had no reason to refuse. 
He stood up and said, “Wait a moment, I’ll be right back.” 
Katheryn was stunned, “Okay, okay…” 
Under the night sky. 
Lin Tian found his way to the palace’s carnivorous horse stable. Although most of them had been taken to the Laiyang Plains and died, there were still a few males left. 
These were all well-bred carnivorous horses. 
They were useless for many things but were quite capable in some. 
Seeing the strong, beautiful muscle lines on the horse’s body and the large grenades on its legs, Lin Tian knew he had chosen correctly. 
In this world, there might be something stronger than carnivorous horses, but for now, Lin Tian had to make do. 
He would definitely be ten times fiercer than before. 
With the flickering light of Abnormal Fusion, the horse’s kidney and Lin Tian’s kidney were swapped. 
“Snap!” 
Almost instantly, the strong legs of the carnivorous horse began to tremble, nearly causing it to collapse to the ground. 
It was so weak it couldn’t stand, only able to lean against the hay beside it, gasping for breath. 
“Damn, is it that serious, old horse? Not that exaggerated, right?” 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but sigh, but he indeed felt great! His back didn’t ache, and his legs didn’t hurt! 
Although the horse’s kidney was much larger than his, the Abnormal Fusion could change its shape to be exactly the same as his. 
The effect and ability wouldn’t change. 
Immediately, Lin Tian hurried towards Lionheart Square. 
He didn’t want to keep Katheryn waiting. 
She stood there like a beautiful pine tree on the steps. 
However, beside her, Alice seemed to be chatting with her. 
“You’re here. Alice, I’ll excuse myself for a moment.” 
Katheryn lowered her head, somewhat shy. 
She prepared to go with Lin Tian to the temple, where no one was. 
But at this moment, Alice unexpectedly called out, “Wait, Messenger, I have something to ask the Holy Mother, is that okay?” 
Lin Tian turned his head. Since she had said so, he could only wait. 
Katheryn’s panicked little heart was suddenly in disarray, having just mustered up her courage. 
Midway, it was deflated. 
The two started an awkward conversation, one sentence at a time. 
“Aren’t the stars less bright than before?” 
Alice stared blankly at the sky, speaking seriously. 
Katheryn’s expression was bitter, “Is… is that so?” 
Then Alice, very seriously, looked at her and asked, “The beef roasted by Gobu Yue seems a bit burnt, I don’t think it’s tasty.” 
“It seems… a bit, Princess Alice, what exactly do you want to say?” 
Even as the Holy Mother, she couldn’t take it anymore. 
Who could endure such an awkward conversation for over an hour? 
Alice was momentarily speechless, not knowing how to answer. 
Anyway, the atmosphere was so awkward it could create a three-bedroom apartment. 
Katheryn seemed to realize, “You–are you stopping me and Lin Tian? This is inevitable, and I don’t mind. As long as the residents can survive, I am willing to do anything.” 
After saying this, she prepared to leave with Lin Tian. 
“Wait, I didn’t mean that. The Messenger’s health has been poor lately, he might not be able to.” 
Alice, at this moment, blushed like a little girl and lowered her head. 
Her intention was not to pity Katheryn. 
Rather, she didn’t want to see Katheryn and Lin Tian engage in that kind of relationship. 
After all, she had borne a child for Lin Tian. In the true sense, Lin Tian was her husband. 
So, she was jealous. 
Lin Tian seemed to realize, “Alice, are you jealous?” 
“I’m not!” Alice immediately denied it. 
But seeing her blushing face in the firelight, even a fool could tell what she was thinking. 
Lin Tian didn’t press the matter further, “You’ve worked hard for so long, let’s go to the empire’s palace.” 
“Ah? I… you… but… how can… I meant, isn’t your health problematic? Won’t it be overloading?” Alice was flustered, speaking incoherently. 
Lin Tian patted his chest, “Don’t worry about that.” 
Just like that, the three disappeared into the darkness. 
Unbeknownst to them, Gobu Slayer had secretly followed them. 
Lia, with her keen eyes, surely didn’t miss it. She said concernedly, “Little Yue, that guy hasn’t taken care of you in a long time. He really doesn’t know how to care for people.” 
Not just Gobu Yue, Lin Tian hadn’t taken care of anyone these past few months. 
“Huh? I’m here, Sister Lia…” 
Gobu Yue was stunned for a moment, then followed along with some excitement. 
… 
On the dark and cold steps of Lionheart Square. 
A lonely person was shedding lonely tears. 
Gobu Kuang’s sorrow flowed like a river, “I really deserve to die, why did I greedily eat those few monsters, sob, sob…” 
But thinking that Lin Tian would surely help him evolve sooner, his heart felt much more at ease. 
Suddenly. 
In the empire’s palace, a few hundred meters behind the square, there seemed to be some noise. 
Gobu Kuang perked up his ears, listening carefully, “Huh? Why does it sound like Lady Alice? And the newcomer Katheryn, and Gobu Yue?!” 
“What is that sound, what are they doing?” 
As he was thinking! 
Gobu Kuang suddenly understood. 
The whole person seemed petrified, standing dazedly in place, with tears streaming down his eyes, “Waaah! Why am I always the one getting hurt?”
