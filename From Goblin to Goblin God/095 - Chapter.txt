Chapter 95: Are You Lucky or Unlucky? 
TL: Sungmin  
“Swish!” 
A large number of water demons leaped out of the lake. 
There were several hundred of them. 
Their faces were full of surprise and shock, some even had wounds on their bodies. 
“What’s going on? Have those beasts gone mad? They bite me as soon as they see me! Even after killing many of them, they still chased and bit me!” 
“Being chased and bitten by low-level monsters is nothing. I was swallowed by a big monster fish at the bottom of the lake! Fortunately, I crawled out through its gills.” 
“Who on earth is behind this?” 
The water demons’ sharp and ear-piercing voices resounded as they discussed the sudden incident. 
“Boom!” 
At this moment, the Water Demon Lord, several times larger than the others, jumped out! 
His entire body was covered in rugged muscles, with a ferocious fish face. After coming ashore, he transformed into a humanoid shape, able to stand on two legs. 
In his hands, he held a giant crocodile and a devil black fish. 
Both were powerful seventh-tier monsters. 
The Water Demon Lord’s expression was gloomy and terrifying. He crushed the two seventh-tier monsters to death. “Something is wrong, someone is controlling these beasts!” 
“Hmph, I didn’t expect you to be smart!” 
At this moment, Lin Tian and his group came down, with the Cannibal Eagle coldly speaking. 
The Water Demon Lord was slightly stunned, then sneered disdainfully after seeing clearly, “Hehe, isn’t this the little chick I plucked a while ago? How has your feather grown back?” 
He then noticed the group of goblins. 
He paid them no mind, “Ah, so you called for help. But you should get your eyes checked if you think goblins can deal with me.” 
“Hahaha!” 
The other water demons also burst into laughter, their voices sharp and creepy. 
Lin Tian gestured for the Cannibal Eagle to hold back, then walked to the front. “I am now the Grand Lord appointed by the Demon Lord. When you see me, shouldn’t you kneel?” 
The water demons glanced at each other. 
Then they laughed even harder. 
“In this great tomb, the law of the jungle rules. So what if you are the Grand Lord? If I kill you, I will be the Grand Lord!” The Water Demon Lord said grimly. 
He pointed to his toes, “With your tiny size, I feel I could crush you to death with my big toe, hahaha!!” 
“Lord, look over there, a human! And a female one at that!” 
A water demon moved to the front, eyes locked onto Alice. 
It was filled with extreme desire. 
The Water Demon Lord finally reacted, licking his lips, “Looks like we hit the jackpot today. Capture that woman!” 
The moment his voice fell. 
A large group of water demons began to shake the fins on the sides of their heads rapidly, howling and releasing piercing sound waves as they charged at Lin Tian’s group. 
However, Lin Tian let out a piercing howl in return. 
In an instant, the massive group of water demons had their ears and noses bleeding, their brains dizzy, and they lost consciousness! 
Many of them collapsed on the spot. 
Lin Tian said, “Kill the males for roasted fish, keep the females.” 
Immediately, Gobu Kuang and the others began their charge! 
Gobu Tian’s Void Dagger struck one after another, creating basketball-sized holes in the chests of numerous corpses. 
No blood flowed out, as their hearts were directly obliterated in the void. 
On the other side, Gobu Kuang acted like a crazed mage, with demon claws burning with blazing blue flames on his back! 
Through the weapons on his other four arms, he continuously fired magical attacks. 
The large blade absorbed the magic flames, unleashing fierce flame slashes! 
Although not as tangible as Alice’s Sword Qi, the resulting slashing flames burned the water demons into two upon contact. 
The axe-like weapons, looking like two giant axes, shot out two beams of magical light. 
In just four to five seconds, they could melt a water demon. 
On another front, Gobu Kuang, wielding Athena’s Spear and Shield, charged into the water demon horde, slaughtering wantonly. 
With the shield in hand, he effortlessly deflected the water demons’ sound waves, corrosive toxins, and claw attacks. 
Seizing their attack openings, he skewered them with his long spear. 
Stringing them up for roasting on the spot, he reserved some for Lin Tian. 
Lia’s God-Hunting Longbow only needed to be fully drawn and aimed at someone for three seconds before releasing brainlessly. 
The arrows would automatically track and pursue the target. 
In just thirty seconds, eight or nine water demons had their heads exploded by a single arrow. 
Because she still needed time to draw the bow and retrieve arrows. 
“What are these things! Are they really goblins?” The Water Demon Lord was stunned on the spot! 
He couldn’t believe what he was seeing. 
A berserk melee mage, a deadly assassin, a brutal warrior, and a precise archer. 
An overwhelming massacre. 
“Stop! Everyone stop!” 
The Water Demon Lord roared, ready to retaliate, when suddenly a cold light flashed before him. 
His vision turned pitch black, empty, and he saw nothing! 
The Cannibal Eagle had directly slashed his eyes blind with its wings, “Today, we will make you remember this forever!” 
“Damn chick! I’ll kill you!” 
The Water Demon Lord, listening to the direction, reached out to grab the Cannibal Eagle. 
Water demons relied on sonar for navigation, so their eyes were actually of little use. 
“Swish, swish, swish!” 
With a single spin, the Water Demon Lord’s hand turned into minced meat. 
The intense pain shot straight to his brain. 
Lin Tian felt he didn’t even need to intervene, “With a power of 4,300, Brother Birdman should be able to handle it by himself.” 
However, as long as it didn’t rain, everything would be fine. 
On rainy days, the water demon race received epic-level enhancements, with rapid recovery, super strength, super defense, super speed, and other effects. 
The weather in the Great Tomb was always gray and gloomy. 
But since there were no clouds in the sky, it probably wouldn’t rain. 
Moments later, the Water Demon Lord was covered in wounds, kneeling on the ground, completely losing the ability to resist. 
The Cannibal Eagle’s claws had dug out a large amount of flesh. 
He looked pitted and battered. 
“Crying Rain Demon, what are you waiting for?!” The Water Demon Lord cried out in pain. 
Suddenly, from an unknown direction, the haunting sound of a woman’s weeping echoed. 
It was extremely eerie. 
As the crying started, clouds began to gather in the sky. 
It started to rain lightly! 
Lin Tian’s expression changed slightly, but he didn’t think it was a big deal. 
The Water Demon Lord, however, grinned sinisterly, “Hehehe, little chick, I’m going to pluck every single feather off you!” 
On the ground, the half-dead Water Demon Lord, with eyes bleeding and body full of gruesome wounds, suddenly began to surge with power! 
His bones creaked, his body growing to six or seven meters! 
His muscles became even more terrifying, and his injuries visibly recovered! 
The Cannibal Eagle sensed trouble, “Little Tian, you and your people should retreat! It’s raining! Rainy days are his home ground!” 
“Too late…” 
Suddenly, a menacing eye appeared next to the Cannibal Eagle, glaring at him. 
A terrifying sound wave blasted out, sending him flying into the water. 
Luckily, his wings were made of metal, otherwise he wouldn’t be able to fly again. 
This was a fatal weakness of the Feathered Race. 
The Cannibal Eagle flew back up, fiercely shooting out several feathers. 
They were so sharp they could pierce through a ten-meter thick tree trunk. 
The Water Demon Lord sneered, simply sidestepping. The feathers sparked but did not kill him. 
In the rain, he had grown armor-like scales. 
He then spat out a large amount of thick, green poison straight at the Cannibal Eagle. 
“Brother Birdman, let me help you!” Lin Tian said as he finished off a male water demon. 
Hearing this, the Water Demon Lord attacked first, “Just you, a goblin?! Low-level monsters will always be low-level monsters! Die!” 
His gigantic fist exploded through the rain, crashing heavily toward Lin Tian! 
However, Lin Tian’s Life Armor activated, encasing him tightly. 
“Boom!” 
The fist only drove Lin Tian into the ground without harming him at all. 
The Water Demon Lord laughed triumphantly, “No need to dig a grave now, hahaha!” 
But then he saw something quickly approaching him from the soil. 
Lin Tian burst out, clawing down with the power of the Blood of Ruin, easily piercing the scales and injuring him. 
The Water Demon Lord felt something wrong, “My scales… Wait, what is this! What’s corroding my strength from inside?” 
In the next second, his body began to shrink, even though the rain hadn’t stopped. 
His bloodline was polluted, preventing him from using his innate skills. 
Soon, he returned to his previous size. 
With a light punch, Lin Tian sent him flying, crashing into a large boulder. 
“An impossible power! Stronger than I was just now!” 
The Water Demon Lord trembled with fear, coughing up blood, 
His chest bones were largely shattered. 
He wanted to escape! 
Madly, he ran toward the lake. Even if the monsters inside attacked him, it was better than facing the goblins! 
Each goblin far exceeded his expectations! 
“Trying to escape?!” 
The Cannibal Eagle dived, like an eagle hunting its prey, fast, accurate, and deadly! 
Feeling the pressure from above, the Water Demon Lord’s face was full of fear, “Damn it! Save me, Lake Ghost!” 
On the shore. 
A pitch-black water monster roared, lunging at the Cannibal Eagle! 
Its voice was so ear-piercing it seemed as if its throat was tearing. 
The Cannibal Eagle reacted quickly but still got his leg wounded, and in the blink of an eye, his entire leg began to turn black and wither! 
It was clearly poisoned. 
This Lake Ghost was covered in black sludge, making it impossible to see its form, and it was bound by many iron chains. 
Its green eyes glanced at Lin Tian and his group, preparing to return to the lake. 
But as it turned, it was frightened and stepped back repeatedly. 
Alice stood there, her face icy and indifferent, holding the Ominous Blade. 
“You!” 
The Lake Ghost felt an inexplicable terror. This woman in black armor, holding a weapon filled with evil aura, was not to be trifled with! 
The Cannibal Eagle urgently warned, “Alice, get out of here! The Lake Ghost is from the ghost tribe; it feels no pain and has no physical form! Those remains and chains are just its vessels. If wounded by ghost energy, you’ll quickly lose your vitality!” 
His leg was the best example. 
Completely devoid of life. 
The Lake Ghost, bracing itself, pounced at Alice. 
The next second, before it could see clearly, it was sliced into pieces! 
“Is that the smell of a ghost? Filthy and foul, but you, Alice, are still quite fragrant…” 
“Roar…” 
In the Lake Ghost’s consciousness, a disdainful voice and a terrifying dragon roar echoed. 
Two extremely powerful and frightening forces pressed down, almost shattering its soul! 
“What is this! No!” 
Finally, the Lake Ghost was forcibly dissipated under the pressure of the magic dragon and dark energy! 
Both were considered spirits, so they affected each other due to magnetic field effects. 
Seeing the unresponsive Lake Ghost, the Cannibal Eagle was dumbfounded, “How is it possible! Can weapons kill ghosts?” 
Completely confused. 
Unfortunately, the Water Demon Lord had escaped. 
“Zzzzz!” 
Suddenly, a chilling electric sound echoed, and Lin Tian pulled out the Spear of Zeus, surrounded by thunder and lightning.
