Chapter 254: Completion of the Full Moon-Class Magic Tool 
TL: Sungmin 
Yet— 
No one in the Hall of Lust responded. 
Only the sounds of Gluttony’s chewing and Sloth’s snoring filled the air. 
Scarlett’s expression darkened slightly. “Everyone, that territory is no longer a wilderness. It’s rich in resources, with humans, monsters, and orderly management. If we take it over, we can indulge there as we please!” 
“Or do you all want to watch a mere goblin stand on equal footing with you in the future? If he grows strong enough, he’ll surely be recruited by that lord!” 
Her voice bristled with urgency. 
Only the Demon King of Envy, Gallows, responded. “I’m in! Kill that filthy, lowly goblin! I’ll take everything from him!” 
Yet he stood alone. Scarlett’s face remained stormy. 
More importantly, she loathed the idea of associating with the Demon King of Envy. 
It left her physically and mentally uncomfortable. 
Hir, the Demon King of Wrath, replied with indifference, “I don’t think it matters if he’s a goblin or not. If he really catches that lord’s eye, it won’t affect me.” 
“I won’t participate in this pathetic game.” The Demon King of Greed, Ladrick, also spoke nonchalantly. 
Having long enjoyed their days of ease, they felt no interest in battles or territories. 
Each followed their own desires. 
Recently, Ladrick only craved greater knowledge to strengthen himself, not petty desires for money or territory. 
Gluttony eventually muttered, “Unlike that arrogant Nanavis, I don’t mind if a goblin is on my level. Even if he’s inferior, it doesn’t concern me.” 
As long as he could keep eating, Gluttony felt content. 
Constant hunger plagued him, leaving him no time for other pursuits. 
Unless, of course, their superior commanded it. 
As for the slothful Winnie… 
Scarlett had long given up on convincing her to help. Winnie could manipulate dreams at will, achieving anything within them. For her, dreams felt as real as waking life, so she spent her days asleep. 
“You… all of you!” Scarlett faltered, growing furious. 
The others raised their brows, staring icily at her. 
At last— 
Scarlett couldn’t contain herself and pleaded, “Fine, consider this a favor to me! Help me kill that wretched goblin! You don’t know how I was used by that creature for ten days. I tried everything I could to please him, only to end up torn in two. If Lady Nana hadn’t saved me, I’d be dead!” 
Her words stirred a flicker of surprise among them. 
No one had expected the Demon King of Lust herself to go so far to please anyone! Quite the scandal. 
Ladrick the Greedy chuckled. “Well, well. No wonder you’re like this. All right, if I have the time, I’ll go check out that wilderness.” 
“I’ll go too. If that creature annoys me, I might help you dispose of him.” Wrath Demon King Hir spoke with his usual indifference. 
In the corner, Gallows, the Demon King of Envy, sneered sinisterly. “Heh heh, Scarlett, if I kill him, would you become a flower fairy to please me just once?” 
Scarlett had felt a glimmer of hope, but Gallows’ leering gaze and vile tone left her deeply uncomfortable. 
Stammering, she gave no answer. 
“Why are you hesitating? You’d rather please a goblin than me?” Gallows’ anger flared, a glimpse of his madness showing. 
Scarlett felt a tinge of fear, uncertain how to respond. 
This only solidified Gallows’ determination to kill Lin Tian. 
He stormed out with a twisted snarl. “How dare you prefer him to me! I’ll kill him right now!” 
“Well, well. I didn’t expect you’d start scheming, dear Scarlett. That kind of crazed fool is easy to manipulate,” Ladrick smirked. 
Scarlett managed a half-laugh. “Yes… who would’ve thought…” 
Her words had unwittingly ignited Gallows’ rage. 
A lucky miscalculation. 
… 
Goblin Empire, Goblin King City 
Lin Tian had already disposed of the bodies of the demi-humans and monsters he’d slain, claiming they’d been killed by creatures from the Uninhabited Zone. 
Anyone doubting him could come forward and question him directly. 
Even those who knew he’d given the kill order dared not voice any objections. 
No other place on this continent matched the Goblin King City for survival. 
The city had now expanded to almost the size of an entire empire! 
Whereas a normal empire’s territory spanned a few hundred kilometers, the Goblin Empire’s royal city alone now stretched over a hundred kilometers! 
Various demi-humans and monsters competed for a place within its borders. 
Some even went to great lengths to flatter Lin Tian, all for a single plot of land. 
Rare and strange items poured in endlessly. 
Due to a new system Lin Tian had implemented for handling land plots, a plot priced at ten thousand gold coins quickly inflated to over a hundred thousand through speculation. 
Many who couldn’t afford it tried to go through back channels, hoping Lin Tian would gift them a plot. 
However, this malicious behavior soon backfired, leading to a collective refusal to buy any plots. Lin Tian had no choice but to sell at the original price, abandoning any further speculation. 
He couldn’t help but marvel at how this kind of real estate manipulation from his past life on Earth, when applied here, was too ruthless—even for monsters. 
… 
In the Goblin Hall, 
Lin Tian sighed in boredom and muttered to himself, “Those three… Why is it taking them so long to find a few Goblin Kings?” 
A month had already passed. 
It was almost impossible they’d been ambushed or killed, as their strength allowed them to roam the Uninhabited Zone freely. 
Even if they encountered something stronger, it would likely treat them with respect. 
At that moment— 
Bill’s voice echoed from outside the hall. “Here it is! Freshly forged magic gear!” 
He’d come to report on the newly crafted Full Moon-class magic items. 
“Take a look,” he said, unveiling a set of armor, a knuckle duster, and a blood-red spear. 
The overwhelming magical energy radiating from the items filled the entire hall, nearly suffocating. 
Lin Tian’s eyebrows lifted in surprise. “Wasn’t it just supposed to be a set of armor and a knuckle duster? Why is there a spear, too?” 
Bill grinned proudly, his mustache practically curling in satisfaction. “While mining for materials, we stumbled upon some Bloodstone. I figured, why not forge you a Blood Spear as well? It’s also Full Moon-class.” 
Bloodstone was an incredibly rare mineral. 
Legend had it that it formed from the blood of a million people seeping into the earth, where it merged into Bloodstone over a thousand years. 
Lin Tian walked down from his throne, grasped Bill’s hand firmly, and said excitedly, “Master, I’ll make sure you’re a ‘great master’ today! The royal consort selection is happening, right? Consider yourself included!” 
Hearing the answer he’d been hoping for, Bill’s beard quivered with excitement. “Hahaha! You’re too kind, Your Majesty Lin Tian. It’s an honor to craft gear for you. When is it happening? I’d like to go prepare!” 
For him, this wasn’t just a game—he was looking to get married for real. 
Given his age and unmarried status, he genuinely wanted a wife, one to share a life with. 
Lin Tian clapped him on the shoulder. “Don’t worry; everything will be arranged for you. Now, tell me—what’s different about this Full Moon-class gear?”
