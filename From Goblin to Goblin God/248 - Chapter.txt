Chapter 248: Trying to Flirt, Courting Death! 
TL: Sungmin  
Scarlett was incredibly confident in her own beauty, particularly when it came to the flower fairy.  
Back then, she had toyed with her for quite a while before reluctantly deciding to kill her. 
“Borrow money? I’m running a high-interest loan here. If you can’t pay me back, don’t expect any mercy,” Lin Tian said in an annoyed tone. 
However, his eyes couldn’t tear themselves away from her. 
She was truly stunning! 
Moreover, this flower fairy wasn’t weak either, boasting a combat power of 11,000. 
That could raise his stats quite a bit. 
Much more than the highland sheep. 
Upon hearing this, Scarlett covered her face and let out a seductive laugh, making everyone around her drool. 
She teased, “What kind of interest can one gold coin get me? Lend it to me.” 
If it were anyone else being flirted with like this, they might hesitate to lend money, but the nearby male demi-humans would’ve definitely rushed to hand over their cash. 
But this was Lin Tian, the king of the empire. 
Unless he didn’t want something, no one would dare covet it. 
“Alright, give her a drink,” Lin Tian smirked darkly. 
Watching Scarlett down the entire drink, Lin Tian’s impatience grew.  
Scarlett seemed surprised, “This drink actually tastes so good?” 
Internally, she grew a little excited, thinking that this wilderness might not be as bad as she thought.  
Once she enslaved Lin Tian, the entire Goblin Empire would be hers. 
She could drink as much as she wanted. 
Lin Tian, barely able to contain himself, blurted, “Alright, miss, you now owe me 100,000 gold coins. Pay up! Otherwise, don’t blame me for being ruthless!” 
“What?”  
Everyone froze in disbelief. 
A single drink now cost 100,000 gold coins? 
Even though Scarlett knew he was just lusting after her, she couldn’t help but retort, “Are you crazy? 100,000 gold coins! Even greed has its limits!” 
In her heart, she cursed Lin Tian’s ancestors up to eighteen generations. 
This lowly, despicable goblin had no understanding of romance whatsoever. 
Clearly, she had been the one to initiate conversation, yet he was acting like some bandit. 
At that moment, her loathing for Lin Tian reached its peak. 
But she also realized this meant that Lin Tian’s desire for her had been fully aroused. His rogue behavior was just a sign of impatience to claim her. 
This played perfectly into her hands. 
“Hmph, can’t pay up? Then don’t blame me for squeezing the value out of you!” Lin Tian sneered, grabbing the flower fairy and heading upstairs. 
Seeing that the fairy didn’t resist much, everyone else in the tavern was dumbfounded. 
“Damn, you can do that?” 
“We had no idea what the Goblin Emperor was like. I’ve learned something today!” 
“This trick is too powerful. I’m going to try it!” 
The demi-humans and monsters around were thrilled, especially the Wild Rhino demi-human and the lizardman who had witnessed yesterday’s events. They were utterly shocked. 
The Wild Rhino demi-human marveled, “I knew yesterday wasn’t a fluke. His Goblin Majesty’s flirting skills are just too incredible! Look, there’s another hottie at the door!” 
“Huh? A Black Tiger Tribe girl? No way. Brother Rhino, you go ahead,” the lizardman said nervously when he saw a dark-skinned, sharp-toothed girl walk through the door. 
The Black Tiger Tribe was notorious for its violence, often hunting stray demi-humans and monsters outside the city for food.  
They didn’t work and were completely isolated from demi-human imperial society. 
They were truly wild and barbaric. 
But after witnessing what Lin Tian did earlier, the Wild Rhino demi-human mustered his courage and approached her, “Miss, what’s wrong?” 
Before the Black Tiger girl could respond, a bunny girl quickly whispered into the rhino’s ear, “Stay away from her. If she gets attached, it won’t end well. She comes here every day asking for drinks, but we never give her any.” 
After all, the goblins were in charge here, and Gobu Shan managed this neighborhood in particular. 
Anyone who broke the rules would face dire consequences. 
“Bang! Bang! Bang!” 
“I want a drink! I want a drink! You’ve got such a big tavern, why are you so stingy? What’s wrong with giving me just one drink!” the Black Tiger girl shouted as she slammed the counter. 
Immediately, the Wild Rhino demi-human, mimicking Lin Tian, said, “Little sister, you want a drink? I can lend you the money, but the interest is steep. Want to try?” 
Hearing the word “lend,” the Black Tiger girl’s eyes flashed with mischief, “Oh? Of course I want it. How much are you willing to lend me?” 
A normal person would ask about the interest first, but not the Black Tiger girl. 
She only cared about how much she could borrow, because she had no intention of paying it back. 
“How about this, I’ll lend you ten gold coins.” 
As he spoke, the Wild Rhino demi-human placed the coins on the table. 
In a flash, the Black Tiger girl snatched them, “Thanks! You damned filthy mutts! Pour me a drink! I want the red flame liquor!” 
Since she had paid, the bunny girls could only grit their teeth and serve her despite the insults. 
When the ten gold coins were gone, the Wild Rhino demi-human rubbed his hands together and laughed, “Little sister, let me explain the interest now. You owe me 1,000 gold coins. If you don’t pay up, don’t blame me for being ruthless! I’ll squeeze every bit of value out of you for that 1,000 gold coins! Heh heh heh!” 
The male demi-humans behind him looked at him with helpless expressions. 
Who didn’t know what the Black Tiger Tribe was like? 
All they could say was, what a waste of those ten gold coins. 
However, what no one expected was that the Black Tiger girl licked her lips and provocatively asked, “Are you sure?” 
“Absolutely sure!” 
“Snort!” 
The Wild Rhino rubbed his fists, snorting two streams of hot air from his nose in a threatening manner. 
The Black Tiger girl slowly stood up, her figure not bad at all, quite sturdy. “Alright then, at the price of ten gold coins per round. If you don’t squeeze out a thousand gold coins’ worth, I won’t stop!” 
“What the hell?!” 
“Damn, is this for real?!” 
“For real?! Did I hear that right?!” 
The seven or eight male demi-humans drinking in the back jumped up in excitement! 
Unbelievable! 
He actually managed to pick up a girl! 
The Wild Rhino’s face lit up with joy. “Great! Fantastic! Brother lizard, I’m about to lose my virginity, hahaha! Long live His Goblin Majesty!!!” 
No one thought this method would actually work. 
His gratitude toward Lin Tian reached its peak. 
But then he suddenly realized, “Wait, you said one round is worth ten gold coins, so for a thousand gold coins, that’s a hundred rounds?” 
“Mm-hmm, that’s right.” The Black Tiger girl sneered. 
The Wild Rhino swallowed hard, “Uh, do I pay in installments or all at once?” 
And that was the real issue. 
The Black Tiger girl laughed coldly, “What do you think? You paid the ten gold coins in one go, so naturally, you’ll repay this all at once too! Come on, my debtor! Hahaha!” 
Her excited laughter rang out. 
The Wild Rhino’s legs instantly turned to jelly, “No, no way, I’ll die! Help!” 
The other demi-humans felt a wave of fear in their hearts, pretending they hadn’t heard anything. 
They watched as the Black Tiger girl dragged him away. 
“Hiss! Picking up girls sure is risky… I just hope the next time we see Rhino brother, he’s still alive!” 
The Lizardman sighed in relief. 
This method was clearly unreliable. 
Even if you wanted to learn it, it depended on the person.
