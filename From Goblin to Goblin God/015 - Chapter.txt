Chapter 15: The Sword Saintess’s Great Defeat 
TL: Sungmin 
Lurking for a long time, Lin Tian struck, his face full of a cold smile, directly piercing the body of the red-haired knight! 
“You! When did you!” 
The red-haired knight’s eyes widened in disbelief! 
“No!” 
Loder let out a painful shout but could only watch helplessly as the red-haired knight’s health hit zero. 
He slowly fell to the ground. 
Blood flowed everywhere. 
Finally, he became motionless. 
At this moment, the silver shieldbearer also reacted, confronting several ambushing goblins. 
Luckily, his defense was high; otherwise, he would have been killed by the ambush. 
After a few moves, he unexpectedly discovered that these goblins were not only strong fighters but also had high defense! 
There were even some using spears, making it impossible to get close. 
“Captain, these goblins are no joke! There are only six of them, and I can’t hold them off!” 
The silver shieldbearer’s terrified voice echoed as the goblins forced him to retreat repeatedly. 
At this moment, the goblins picked up burning torches and threw them at him. 
The flames ignited the fabric on his armor, burning him directly. 
“Ahhh! It hurts! It hurts so much!” 
The silver shieldbearer screamed hysterically! He threw down his shield and ran around wildly, becoming a human torch. 
“Damn goblins!!! I will kill you all!!!” 
Loder roared with heart-wrenching fury. 
Ifreya also burst into tears, even though she had never reacted like this when facing dragons. 
Now, two teammates had died directly! 
Lin Tian coldly smiled and said, “It’s time to go. The rest of you, go hunt those controlling the dragon crossbows!” 
Then, with about ten goblins, he took the two and jumped into the drainage ditch, making a quick escape! 
Just like that, Bright Town was completely thrown into chaos! 
Earlier, facing a group of dragons that had wreaked havoc on the town, they had not panicked, but now, they were completely disoriented. 
At the foot of a distant mountain. 
A large area of trees collapsed into splinters! 
The small animals were so frightened that they died from fear, not even having a chance to escape! 
The Sword Saintess was fiercely engaged in her battle! 
Several hills had been leveled. 
It was extraordinarily shocking! 
“What’s going on? Goblins dare to invade at a time like this?” 
The Sword Saintess’s tone held a hint of surprise as she coldly stared at the woman in purple armor before her. 
Now, she had taken off her blindfold, revealing deep azure eyes. 
It was as if two icebergs were in her eyes. 
The woman in purple armor was the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, transformed into human form. 
She stood about two meters tall, with a very hot figure. The armor wasn’t exactly armor but an exoskeleton grown from her flesh, very imposing. 
Her golden slit-pupil eyes were extremely sharp. 
However, her body was already covered with wounds, oozing lava-like blood. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother opened her mouth full of sharp teeth and said, “Heh heh, it seems you can barely take care of yourself, human Sword Saintess…” 
As she spoke, she reached out with her clawed hand and attacked again. 
Her speed was incredible! The force of her movement sent wood splinters flying into the air behind her! 
The Sword Saintess still handled it with ease, “Barely take care of myself? Let’s see how much more dragon blood you have left to spill.” 
“High-tier Sword Technique! Steel Gale!” 
She formed magical runes on her long sword and began swinging wildly! 
Each strike released a powerful, tangible sword qi! 
Dense and numerous! 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s pupils contracted, and she quickly covered her head to defend, the exoskeleton on her body growing madly to encase her. 
However, under the Steel Gale, the exoskeleton shattered continuously! 
Her whole body was sent flying, deeply embedding into the ground. 
The diverted Steel Gale slashed ten-meter-long, three-meter-deep cracks into the ground! 
It was a shocking sight! 
The Sword Saintess was about to pursue but was interrupted by the piercing screams of Bright Town’s residents, breaking her focus. 
Since her task was to protect Bright Town, it wouldn’t count as protection if everyone died. 
She had to turn back and rush towards Bright Town. 
“Heh heh, goblins? Thank you very much. I almost got finished by this crazy woman. I won’t let you off!” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, covered in blood, struggled to stand up. 
Transforming back into a sky-covering giant dragon, she flew towards Dragon Island. 
With a roar, the remaining dozen dragons also followed. 
Continuing was no longer necessary; the losses were too severe this time. 
“Did she escape? Never mind, I’ll personally go to Dragon Island and slaughter them clean.” The Sword Saintess looked up at the sky and whispered. 
Then she hurried into Bright Town. 
Residents emerged from the shelter, and a group of goblins was wantonly slaughtering them, bodies strewn all over the ground! 
Many female residents were even being violated by the goblins on the spot! 
These scenes fueled the Sword Saintess’s fury! 
Under her watch, Bright Town had become like this! 
“Loder! You useless fool! Can’t you even kill a bunch of goblins?” 
However, no one responded. 
The Sword Saintess’s anger intensified! She raised her longsword high into the air. 
With a roar to the sky, she shouted, “Ultimate Sword Technique! Heaven’s Finale!” 
Instantly, a powerful aura erupted from her, extinguishing all the scattered flames within a hundred meters! 
Immediately, a massive magic circle began forming in the sky. 
Swords formed from magic fell from the heavens! 
They landed precisely on the goblins’ heads! 
In less than five seconds, dozens of goblins, each as strong as an adventurer, were all dead! 
However, the Sword Saintess found it somewhat overwhelming, her body noticeably swaying. 
She could have killed them one by one without breaking a sweat, but the chaotic crowd greatly hindered her. 
A strong fighter like her, wielding such power, risked injuring ordinary residents. 
At this moment, a severely injured adventurer stepped forward, “Your Holiness, Loder and the others, they were captured by the goblins!” 
He was none other than the second-ranked in Bright Town, the leader of the Gale Heroes, Beck. 
“What?” 
The Sword Saintess was shocked. Captured by mere goblins? 
After all, he was considered her disciple! 
If this got out, it would be incredibly embarrassing. 
Beck, clutching his wound, seemed to recall something terrifying and spoke with some hysteria, “These goblins are very unusual; each one is as strong as a big variant. The red-haired knight and the silver shieldbearer are dead! Why, why did this happen!” 
Hearing this, the Sword Saintess looked to the side. 
Indeed, she saw the bodies of the two. 
“Each one as strong as a big variant? Hmph, I’ll slaughter every goblin tribe in the surrounding enchanted forests!” 
At this moment, she was enraged! 
Wild sword energy swirled around her! 
Every step she took left spiderweb-like cracks on the charred ground! 
At this time, a resident crouching in fear on the ground spoke up, “Saintess, are you leaving? What will we do if you leave?” 
“Yes, Saintess, if those evil dragons come back, what will we do? There might still be goblin remnants!” 
Many residents, trembling and crouching on the ground, were full of fear.
