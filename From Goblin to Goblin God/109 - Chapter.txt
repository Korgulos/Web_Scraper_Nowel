Chapter 109: The Power of the Twelve-Winged Seraph 
TL: Sungmin 
Rebecca, brushing past Lin Tian, only gave him a fleeting glance. 
Her gaze was filled with disdain and contempt. 
For them, Lin Tian was now just a pawn they could discard. 
They didn’t care about his life or death at all. 
“Hey, Demon Lord, I feel like I’m going to die. Can you heal me?” Lin Tian shouted from afar. 
Unfortunately, Veronica merely brushed him off, saying, “We need to enter quickly and press the attack. Stay still; someone will come to save you later.” 
Alright, alright. 
So, this was how they wanted to play. 
Murderous intent surged in Lin Tian’s eyes as he took out a world-class healing magical device. 
He healed himself sufficiently. 
Now it was time to bring out the Goblin army from the snowy plains. 
They wanted to reap the battlefield. 
He would reap them instead. 
At that moment. 
The Pope, with Kingdom Come interrupted, suffered a significant backlash and was being supported by the Holy Mother, gasping for breath. 
“From the first glance, I knew that guy wasn’t human. I didn’t expect Veronica to exploit this…”  
The Pope’s voice was hoarse, his aged appearance suggesting he might collapse at any moment. 
The Holy Mother hurriedly cast healing magic, but it was to no avail. 
At over a hundred years old, every spell he cast consumed his life force, which couldn’t be replenished. 
Moreover, healing magic essentially exhausted life force. 
Cells could only divide a limited number of times; once they stopped dividing and waste cells accumulated, a person would die. 
Thus, many people tried to avoid getting injured. 
Even with world-class healing magic, healing shortened one’s life. 
The old Pope sighed, “Don’t waste your magic. I never planned to go back alive. They’re coming…” 
In the distance. 
The terrifying dark power of the Enchanted Forest spread towards the battlefield! 
With every step Veronica and her group took, the surrounding sky lost its light, becoming extremely dim. 
“It’s been a long time, Douglas. I’ve missed you over these decades,” Veronica said mockingly. 
Rebecca still wore her arrogant expression, not taking anyone seriously. 
The creatures behind them grew increasingly restless. 
All the imperial soldiers, ordered by the cardinal, retreated behind the Pope and his group. 
With the destruction of Kingdom Come, Ifreya’s power waned significantly. 
World-class magic could no longer be maintained. 
Earlier, Lin Tian had instructed Gobu Kuang and the others to retreat with the goblins if Veronica and her group arrived. 
The old Pope, with a heavy and hateful expression, said, “Decades have passed, and you haven’t changed at all, Veronica…” 
“That only means your eyes are failing. My power is no longer the same as it was!”  
Veronica’s eyes flashed with a crimson light. 
Over the decades, several twelfth-tier creatures of her caliber had emerged. 
Sadly, many were killed by numerous Popes. 
Only she survived. 
The Pope sighed again, “What do you want? Why must you increase the slaughter?” 
“You increased the slaughter! I only wanted a piece of my former life, but you obstructed me time and again. Today, I’ll take it all back!”  
Veronica’s tone was icy, filled with resolve. 
No one starts out wanting to rule the world or a kingdom. 
She just wanted to experience life again, not dwell in the darkness with hideous creatures. 
But the Church’s doctrine of eradicating all monsters led to this outcome. 
Unlike Buddhism, which preached conversion and negotiation. 
Though Buddhists sometimes used demons as mounts, they didn’t provoke large-scale conflicts. 
Taoism emphasized balance between good and evil, yin and yang, with its own criteria for judging evil. If you weren’t evil, you could coexist. 
After all, no one chose their appearance at birth. 
Ultimately, it was the lofty authority of the gods that caused this. 
The old Pope tried to reason, “Life? But you are already dead. Staying in the Great Tomb is your life.” 
“Unreasonable! Attack!” Veronica, infuriated by his words, declared outright. 
Suddenly! 
A terrifying oppressive force against monsters surged! 
The old Pope radiated a dazzling light and said faintly, “World-class Magic: Holy Lake of Eden!” 
In the next second. 
The entire Laiyang Plain turned into a vast lake. 
Filled with pure holy water, the shimmering lake was lethal to monsters. 
Contact with it would burn and corrode their bodies. 
All the monsters began to sink into the Holy Lake, the pain unbearable when touched by the holy water. 
Let alone falling in. 
Gobu Kuang, filled with curiosity, found the forming lake beneath his feet clear and pure. 
It looked very drinkable. 
He reached out, ready to scoop some up and taste it. 
Alice shouted coldly, “Stop! I advise you not to touch it.” 
Goblin Slayer snapped, “You really are ignorant. If you drink that, your guts will rot.” 
“Damn!” 
These words shocked Gobu Kuang into silence. 
“Heretic Summoning: Hell’s Lava!” Veronica immediately retaliated. 
Several giant magic arrays formed under their feet, spreading across the entire Laiyang Plain, encompassing the Holy Lake’s range. 
Next, a vast amount of scorching lava appeared. 
When the lava met the holy water, it erupted in massive clouds of white smoke. 
The reaction between the water and lava turned into a large amount of obsidian. 
The monsters stood on the obsidian, unaffected by the holy water. Gobu Kuang’s trembling heart finally calmed down. 
The old Pope’s expression changed slightly, clearly not expecting this outcome. 
Things were more troublesome than anticipated. 
“Scared? Why not become my subordinate, like your son? At least you won’t die of old age. How about it?” 
Veronica taunted, pointing to the Corpse Pope beside her. 
Covered in corpse spots, he stood there lifelessly. 
He was once Douglas’s son. 
Otherwise, the entire church wouldn’t lack someone with power comparable to the Pope. 
The Corpse Pope was already dead; he moved only because a heretic creature controlled him. 
Thus, his power was very low, only 6,000. 
But if the control was lifted and he fully zombified, he could reach nearly 9,000. 
In that state, the Corpse Pope could use his original magic. 
However, he couldn’t think and would fall into indiscriminate slaughter. 
Veronica cast another spell, “Heretic Summoning: Dark Realm!” 
This spell targeted only her and the old Pope, pulling them into an alternate world, ensuring he couldn’t self-destruct and kill the other monsters. 
“It’s our turn now. Let’s wipe them all out!” 
Rebecca said coldly, transforming into a black and white meteor, weaving through the monks. 
Blood splattered! 
Her tail sting pierced the necks of over a dozen monks. 
The cardinal quickly cast a spell to trap her, “Damn succubus, enough!” 
He gathered super-tier magic, forming three magic arrays, “Crucifixion!” 
“Hehe~ Can you really bear to hurt me?” 
Rebecca laughed lightly, her charm overwhelming. 
Using her bewitching power, she made even the cardinal momentarily distracted. 
Let alone the other monks and imperial soldiers, who couldn’t move their legs, their minds consumed by lust, almost losing control on the spot. 
This was a powerful and qualified succubus. 
She didn’t need to fight herself; just one look could incapacitate others. 
In just two seconds of distraction. 
The golden cross attack missed, killing only a few hundred big goblins. 
“Damn succubus! I’ll never stop until you’re dead!” The cardinal gritted his teeth, his face red with anger. 
His manly pride was shattered, making him feel pathetic. 
He had lasted only two seconds! 
Rebecca laughed mockingly, “Haha? I made you feel good, yet you want to kill me? The church is full of murderous lunatics!” 
“This time, I won’t lose! Super-tier Magic: Holy Field!” 
“Super-tier Magic: Crucifixion!” 
“Boom!” 
Unable to dodge, this strike left Rebecca in a bad state, her black feathers scattering in the air. 
Blood trickled from her lips. 
She was surprised, “You… seem stronger?” 
“That’s thanks to you, putting me into sage mode!” 
The cardinal shamelessly said, never expecting to be so effective now. 
He could now repeatedly cast Crucifixion! 
He launched another attack! 
Suddenly, a cold light flashed, and Alice blocked the strike, standing in front of Rebecca. “He’s mine to kill. No need for you to intervene.” 
“Oh?” Rebecca looked at her curiously. 
She had been wary before but now felt a bit of admiration. 
Thus, they began a combined attack on the cardinal. 
Even in sage mode, he was overwhelmed and couldn’t fight back, “Damn! Holy Mother, I need to use that. We must eliminate this monster and Alice!” 
“Cardinal, hold on! The Pope isn’t out yet! Hang in there!” 
The Holy Mother shouted from the rear, healing the severely injured monks and holy knights. 
Many had their lifespans drastically shortened. 
But they all understood. 
The Pope was no longer a match for Veronica. 
The cardinal gritted his teeth, “Hurry!!! If I die now, I won’t even get a chance to fight!” 
“Ultimate Magic: Fiery Redemption!” 
A beam of holy light shot from the rear, striking the cardinal. 
It also forced Alice and Rebecca back. 
They watched him warily, unsure what was happening. 
Rebecca grew cautious, “Is this… angelic power? No, impossible…” 
“It’s the power of an angel, and not just any angel, but the power of a twelve-winged seraph. The user will be burned to ashes within ten minutes, but during that time, they gain immense power. That is redemption…” Alice said heavily, feeling the situation was dire. 
Even the Darkspawn were wary, “We should retreat. It’s only ten minutes, right?” 
But escaping wasn’t an option. 
In an instant! 
The cardinal, engulfed in holy fire, stood before them. 
Under the holy fire’s burning, Rebecca felt a fate worse than death! She could barely breathe! 
She was completely powerless to fight back. 
The sensation of death filled her mind!
