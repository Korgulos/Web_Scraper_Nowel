Chapter 52: Hero, It’s Your Turn, Don’t Run Away! 
TL: Sungmin  
Lorna was also shocked and quickly restrained the young man, “Wait! Don’t be impulsive! We need to restrain him together!” 
Several people hurriedly held the young man back. 
Otherwise, he might have ended up like the boy earlier. 
“Everyone, spread out and surround him!” Lorna commanded.  
It was clear she was also very nervous, possibly because this was her first real battle. 
After all, everyone’s first time would be like this. 
The group did as told, clearly shaken by the earlier scene. 
A vibrant life turned into a heap before their eyes. 
The Beast King Goblin, full of disdain, prepared to kill the young man. 
But as he moved, attacks flew at him from all sides! 
Arrows, magic, and even close-combat strikes left him no room to react. 
Once they spread out, the Beast King Goblin didn’t know who to attack first. 
If he attacked one, the others would focus their attacks on him. 
He was bound to get hurt. 
Seeing the current situation, Lorna smiled with relief but quickly became vigilant again, silently cheering herself on, “Come on, Lorna, stay focused. You’re a role model at the academy. Now you need to set an example and lead everyone to win this first real battle!” 
These nobles attended elite schools, taught by powerful adventurers, retired warriors, and other instructors. 
Although they had practical training under their teachers’ supervision, it didn’t really count. 
Now, this was a real battle. 
But just in those few seconds of Lorna being distracted! 
The young man still couldn’t escape being slaughtered. 
The Beast King Goblin punched the ground, transmitting force and killing the young man on the spot! 
His body twisted, as if crumpled into a ball. 
Because all his bones were shattered, he lost all support. 
“Cousin!” 
Lorna’s heart shook with guilt, “Everyone, dodge and keep attacking him! We can definitely wear him down!” 
Everyone followed her orders and started attacking. 
The effect was very noticeable. Under constant attack, the Beast King Goblin’s crocodile skin armor protected his back, but other areas began showing significant injuries. 
“Great! Keep it up!” 
“This mere goblin, your teeth will be our first trophy!” 
“Don’t let up, continue attacking! Buy Lorna time to land a fatal blow!” 
Everyone felt hopeful and went all out. 
Lorna, holding a white jade long spear, circled the Beast King Goblin, looking for an opportunity to strike with the holy spear. 
Her slender figure was hard to catch at high speed. 
Her long ponytail streamed behind her, and her serious expression was very captivating. 
“Got it!” 
As the Beast King Goblin attacked others nearby, Lorna locked onto his side, aiming for his kidney. 
She raised the spear and infused it with power, “High-tier Martial Skill · Holy Spear of Exorcism!” 
The golden spearhead glowed with holy light! She fiercely stabbed into the Beast King’s kidney! 
Immediately, he howled in pain! 
Holy power infused, and from the wound, cracks spread like a spiderweb! 
The Beast King Goblin, furious, veins bulging with rage! 
He glared at Lorna! 
“Damn woman, you were making noise the whole time, annoying me, and now you dare sneak attack me!” The Beast King Goblin gritted his teeth and said. 
Seeing the situation was bad, Lorna prepared to flee. 
But the spearhead was stuck in the Beast King Goblin’s rib, and she couldn’t pull it out. 
Others realized the danger, “Oh no, quick, save Sister Lorna!” 
As everyone rushed to attack him, the Beast King Goblin showed a sinister smile, exactly what he wanted! 
Otherwise, he could have killed Lorna first. 
Then he opened his bloody mouth and took a deep breath! 
“Roar!!!” 
He used his innate skill, Beast King’s Roar! 
It unleashed a powerful sonic attack on those nearby, causing severe dizziness! 
The terrifying roar echoed through the world! The space seemed to ripple and twist! 
Those close to him, within seconds, rolled their eyes and stood dazed. 
Blood flowed from their ears, eyes, and nostrils. 
Their brains lost all consciousness. 
Some who hadn’t fully relieved themselves today, did so now. 
Including Lorna, who stood frozen, her eyes rolling back, even foaming at the mouth. 
The Beast King Goblin, enduring the pain, pulled the spear from his kidney. 
Then, with a sweeping strike, he impaled five unconscious people, nailing them to the ground. 
The rest were swatted like mosquitoes, one ‘smack’ at a time. 
The sound of flesh and bone shattering was hair-raising. 
At this point, Lorna regained some consciousness but stumbled and fell, turning her head to see familiar faces. 
They were skewered by her spear, piled like a human pyramid. 
Their heads tilted in one direction, eyes rolled back, bleeding from their features, seemingly looking at Lorna, silently voicing their suffering. 
Lorna screamed in fear. Looking around, she found no trace of anyone else! 
She had no idea what had just happened. 
However, the pools of blood and flesh on the ground gave her a pretty good idea. 
“Why, why is this happening? This is nothing like what they taught at the academy. How could there be such a powerful goblin? Why can’t I even handle it?” 
Lorna trembled in terror, her head aching. 
At the academy, she had always been a top student, excelling in both combat skills and theoretical knowledge. 
But now, it seemed luck no longer favored her. 
She couldn’t accept such a failure. 
At this moment, the Beast King Goblin growled, “It’s your turn, annoying fly!” 
He reached out, ready to grab Lorna. 
At this critical moment, Lorna seemed to awaken, “I can’t lose! I must avenge everyone!” 
She quickly regained full consciousness, ready to rise and continue fighting. 
But the next second! 
“Crack!” 
The sound of bones shattering filled the air! 
Lorna felt a piercing pain shoot from her feet straight to her brain, “Aaaah!!” 
Looking down, she saw her feet had been crushed by the Beast King Goblin! 
Next were her hands! 
The sound of bones breaking was excruciatingly loud, causing intense pain to anyone who heard it. 
Lorna screamed with all her might, nearly losing consciousness, drooling uncontrollably, “Father! Teacher, save me!” 
On the other side of the hill. 
Stantmont’s heart tightened at hearing her pained cries for help, “Lorna!” 
He was about to rush over. 
Felomon sternly shouted, “Count! We are the commanders, we cannot fall!” 
In a battle, if the enemy leader died, it meant certain defeat! 
With morale greatly reduced, soldiers would think of nothing but escaping, losing all combat ability. 
“My daughter! Are they, are they all dead?” 
Stantmont trembled with grief and anger, his teeth nearly breaking from clenching so hard! 
Felomon was not much better off. Many of the people over there were his children or family members. 
At this moment, the silhouette of the Beast King Goblin appeared again on the hill. 
He was holding a delicate figure, but was defiling it. 
As if playing with a toy! 
Through the moonlit shadow, one could see the long ponytail swaying with the Beast King Goblin’s movements. 
It was clearly Lorna’s body. 
“Hahaha!” 
The Beast King Goblin’s unrestrained laughter echoed, then he began eating Lorna’s body bite by bite like a cucumber. 
“Damn beast!!!” 
This scene, engraved deeply in Stantmont’s eyes, made him unable to hold back any longer! 
Even though he hadn’t been an imperial warrior for many years, the battle spirit in his heart was reignited by rage! 
He raised his sword and charged through the chaotic battle! 
Felomon shouted, “Count! Come back! We are about to win!” 
But it was futile. 
If he hadn’t seen that scene, Stantmont could have held back. After all, he had led troops in battle before. 
As a leader, he understood the importance of the bigger picture. 
But those scenes, anyone would find it unbearable to see their daughter treated like that. 
“Hmph.” 
The Beast King Goblin sneered coldly, also charging towards Count Stantmont! 
His speed increased, and in ten seconds, he reached Stantmont, swinging his massive fists down! 
Count Stantmont raised his sword to block, but his strength was insufficient. 
Years without fighting had severely diminished his overall strength. 
Now, he barely had a combat strength of 1500. 
In his prime on the imperial battlefield, he had a combat strength of 3000 and could have easily won. 
But now, he was sent flying with one punch! 
He landed amidst the chaotic battle. 
“Count! What’s wrong?” 
A shield bearer, shocked, rushed to protect him from other goblins. 
But while he could fend off ordinary goblins, he couldn’t withstand the overwhelming strength of the Beast King Goblin. 
The Beast King Goblin leaped over, flinging the shield bearer aside, and grabbed Stantmont, ready to crush him. 
However, he overlooked the fact that there were no more goblins around, mostly imperial soldiers. 
Several spears immediately pierced his body! 
The Beast King Goblin howled in pain, throwing Stantmont aside and swinging his fists to repel the fully armored soldiers. 
But as more soldiers surrounded him, he began to lose ground. 
Fully armored soldiers were different from the earlier young ones, not easily killed in one blow, and they fought fiercely. 
Shield bearers blocked the front, while cavalry stabbed him repeatedly. 
One shield bearer could be flung away, but several together, their shields locked, couldn’t be broken through no matter how strong he was. 
The shields had clasps, perfect for encircling. 
However, the spears could only inflict superficial wounds, making it difficult to kill him. 
“Hero! Quick! Deliver a fatal blow!” 
On the ground, Stantmont gritted his teeth, looking back at the Wandering Hero. 
TL: Shit, poor Lorna. She didn’t even do anything…
