Chapter 205: Don’t Cry When the Time Comes 
TL: Etude 
The command embedded deep within their genes had been activated. 
This was a gene-specific effect unique to the goblin species, similar to the insect race. 
“What are you standing around for? Use your climbing ability and get up there!” Lin Tian hurriedly urged. 
These were all his offspring. 
Logically, they should have inherited his abilities. 
After all, he had the climbing skill. 
This was one of the goblin’s strengths, the ability to inherit certain basic abilities. 
As long as it wasn’t magic or passive effects, most of the abilities could be inherited. 
Hearing his command, they all began climbing up the magical puppets. 
The climbing skill came naturally to them. 
And with roots growing from their feet, the effect was even better. 
Countless goblins swarmed up the puppets. 
It didn’t take long. 
One puppet collapsed! 
Then the second, the third, ten, a hundred! 
The situation unfolded so suddenly that the Elephant King couldn’t react in time. “Fall back! Don’t let those goblins get close, keep them at a distance and destroy them!” 
He hadn’t expected there would be such a high-intelligence goblin king that could issue commands and control them. 
But unfortunately, it was too late. 
With only one or two thousand magical puppets remaining, the million goblins, having found a way, completely crushed them! 
“Are you crazy?! Holy Tree King, you actually colluded with the goblins?! This is beyond despicable!” the Elephant King yelled in frustration. 
Such a turn of events was something he never could have anticipated. 
Of course, no one had, including Lin Tian. 
The Holy Tree King, who had come closer to observe, couldn’t hold back, “What the hell are you talking about?! I’m just as baffled as to why the Holy Tree produced so many goblins!!” 
But, looking at the current situation, things still seemed favorable. 
At the very least, the Giant Elephant Empire was facing collapse and the threat of total annihilation. 
Suddenly, the two of them seemed to realize something, “Kill that goblin king!” 
Their cold gazes locked onto Lin Tian. 
“Holy Tree King, how will you repay me if I help you kill that goblin?” the Elephant King asked coldly. 
The Holy Tree King hesitated for a moment. “With things as they are, I don’t care if you incorporate us, but we absolutely cannot let these damned goblins succeed! I still need to figure out why this is happening!” 
The situation had indeed become a mystery that could only be described as one of the world’s unsolved puzzles. 
Upon hearing this, the two of them came to an agreement. 
“You hold off those goblins, and I’ll go kill their leader!” the Elephant King ordered, once again pulling out a magical figurine and activating it. 
It transformed into a flaming skeletal horse, and he mounted it, flying through the air. 
He even handed one to the Holy Tree King. 
“Where the hell did you come from, goblin?! Why didn’t I notice you earlier?” the Holy Tree King asked, his face filled with fury and hatred. 
The key point was that their Holy Tree had been polluted, which was utterly unacceptable. 
Lin Tian looked at the two coldly. “You really don’t recognize me? Weren’t you both plotting to carve up my empire?” 
“What?!” 
The two of them felt a chill run down their spines. 
In unison, they exclaimed, “The Goblin Empire?!” 
“That’s impossible! Why are you here? By the timeline, shouldn’t you be dead by now?” the Elephant King asked in confusion. 
So many powerful figures had been sent by the three great empires. There was no reason for them to fail. 
Even if he didn’t trust himself, he believed the people from the Troy Empire had absolute strength. 
Lin Tian chuckled coldly, “Too bad for you, all your people are dead. And you’re next!” 
“Bullshit! You probably escaped when your empire was taken over, trying to take advantage of the chaos, huh? Do you really think we’re as stupid as the Great Tomb or the Lionheart Empire?” the Elephant King sneered with disdain. 
With their combined strength surpassing ten thousand, they weren’t afraid of a mere goblin. 
As long as they killed the Goblin King, the rest of the goblins would fall apart, and dealing with them would be easy. 
The Holy Tree King added, “Even if our people aren’t your match, what about the people from the Troy Empire? Don’t tell me you even managed to kill the Troy Princess…” 
Someone capable of summoning Demon King-level creatures. 
Neither of them had any confidence in defeating such a person. 
They were powerful kings, but not powerful warriors. 
Lin Tian grinned, “You’re right, I didn’t manage to kill her. But that doesn’t mean I couldn’t conquer her.” 
As he finished speaking, Sara, standing beside him, removed her cloak, her sharp gaze locked onto the two. 
At that moment, it felt like they had been struck by lightning! 
The two kings nearly fell off their skeletal horses in disbelief. “Princess Sara! You! How is this possible?!” 
“Why? Did we really fail?! And why did the Holy Tree produce so many goblins?” 
Overwhelmed by shock and confusion, the Holy Tree King felt on the verge of collapse. He wanted nothing more than to stab himself and check if this was all just a nightmare! 
It was too much, completely defying common sense. 
Sara stepped forward to explain, “What else could it be? Your tree spirit had an encounter with His Majesty, the Goblin King, and it was devoured.” 
“The Tree Spirit…” 
“GOBLIN! I WILL TEAR YOU TO PIECES!!!” 
Hearing this, the Holy Tree King lost it completely. His rage surged uncontrollably as he charged madly at Lin Tian, spear in hand! 
Sara immediately raised her ancient staff, chanting, “Ultimate Summoning Magic · King of the Nile!” 
Splash! 
The sound of water splashing rang out! 
The Crocodile Demon King appeared once more, opening its massive jaws and lunging forward for a fierce bite! 
“World-Class Magic · Earth Prison!” 
In a rush, the Holy Tree King activated his skill. 
Thick branches shot up from the ground, wrapping around the Crocodile Demon King, pulling it downward into the earth! 
This magic could drag an enemy ten thousand meters underground! If the demon couldn’t escape in time, it would surely meet its end. 
The Elephant King seized the opportunity, “Super-Tier Magic · Puppet Control!!” 
A magic formation appeared, targeting Lin Tian! 
If it hit, Lin Tian would be turned into a puppet, controlled at will. 
Lin Tian sneered in disdain. After all, he now wielded the strength of ten thousand battles. 
He cast his own spell, “Hero’s Power!” 
Ancient runes circled his body like an impenetrable golden shield, blocking the puppet magic. 
Hero’s Power granted immunity to all control-type skills, including puppet magic. 
Lin Tian then drew the Spear of Zeus, shouting, “Thunder Punishment!” 
A thick bolt of white lightning as wide as a bowl struck down from the sky! 
The blinding light left everyone momentarily dazed, followed by a deafening roar of thunder. 
The Elephant King was struck down to the ground by the lightning, his entire body paralyzed, unable to move. 
Crack! 
In the next instant, the Crocodile Demon King, having emerged from the earth, opened its blood-soaked jaws and tore the Elephant King to pieces. 
He didn’t even have time to scream. 
The Holy Tree King watched in disbelief, eyes wide with horror. “Damn it, goblin! How could we fall to a goblin?!” 
This outcome was something he could not accept! 
Being defeated by the Giant Elephant Empire would have been bearable. 
But now, both their empires would fall to a goblin! 
That lowest, weakest of races! 
Now it had become so powerful! 
It shattered his spirit, destroyed his kingdom, and crushed his beliefs! 
“No!!!” 
In a desperate, grief-filled scream, the Holy Tree King was cleaved into a bloody pulp by a fishbone dagger. 
On the other side. 
Upon seeing their king’s gruesome death, the Giant Elephant Empire’s warriors turned and fled in terror! 
But they were nothing more than defeated stragglers now. 
Lin Tian gave the order, “Everyone, come back. There’s no need to chase them!” 
Both of these empires were already in his grasp; it was only a matter of time. 
The Giant Elephant Empire’s forces had been depleted, and the city was filled with nothing but common citizens. 
There was no need to worry about any uprising. 
“Your Majesty, I… I don’t even know what to say. The invincible spear and shield of an empire, just like that, gone…” Sara’s voice trembled with excitement, her body shaking slightly. 
She could hardly believe the scale of the victory, the magnitude of this honor! 
The goblin standing before her had completely shattered her worldview. 
How she wished she could be like him. 
Lin Tian smiled calmly, “I didn’t expect it either. Though I planned it all, gaining an extra million-strong army was quite the bonus.” 
“Yes, I almost forgot, this was all part of your plan, this…” 
Sara was still reeling from the shock. 
It was unbelievable. 
A single small action had won them two great empires and boundless lands. 
It was like a tiny lever shifting the weight of the entire world. 
Lin Tian gazed at the blood-soaked and desolate battlefield. 
He prepared to return, dispatching people to clean up the aftermath and seize control of the Giant Elephant Empire as well. 
Previously, Persephia had already been captured. 
There was no need to worry about puppet magic for the time being; he was certain he could acquire it. 
Right now, Lin Tian had no interest in dealing with such matters. What he wanted was to eliminate that harlot Joan of Arc, and then take down the Troy Empire. 
The lands within the wilderness were essentially his now. 
Only by slowly growing stronger would he be ready to face the powerful beings outside the zone. 
Before long. 
Gobu Kuang, Alice, the One-Eyed Owl, and the others all rushed over. 
They gazed around at the magnificent decorations of the Holy Tree Palace. 
“No way, Boss! You were only gone a few days, and you’ve already taken down a Great Empire!” Gobu Kuang and the others couldn’t help but praise him. 
Lin Tian was like a god in their eyes, but even this seemed too unbelievable. 
They found it hard to accept. 
The One-Eyed Owl, looking as astonished as a child, exclaimed, “You bastard! You keep surprising me more and more! Joan of Arc is nothing compared to you!” 
“Lin Tian, the key thing is, you didn’t take a single soldier with you when you left. How did you manage to pull this off?” Osius and Grugia couldn’t help but ask. 
Everyone was so overwhelmed with shock that they almost wanted to cry. 
This kind of achievement—surely unprecedented and unmatched throughout history. 
Lin Tian raised his hand to stop them. “No need to be amazed just yet. The Giant Elephant Empire isn’t fully taken down. Alice, Big Sis, I’m leaving it to you two.” 
“Messenger, there are definitely still a lot of militia inside. We can’t handle them with just our small group,” Alice said helplessly. 
There were easily over a million militia members. Even if they went in, it wouldn’t make a difference. 
Lin Tian replied calmly, “Don’t worry. There’s a million-strong goblin army waiting outside.” 
“What?!” 
As they looked at the massive goblin army that seemed to appear out of thin air, everyone felt like they were dreaming! 
Alice immediately took charge like a general, gathering the soldiers and preparing for action. 
Watching them leave, Lin Tian’s lips curled into a faint smile. “Joan of Arc, oh Joan of Arc, tell me, what do you have left to fight me with? Don’t cry when the time comes!”
