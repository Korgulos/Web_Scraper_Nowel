Chapter 243: The Youthful Loser Won’t Dream of the Big Sis Next Door 
TL: Sungmin  
Alice was just about to follow them inside, puzzled as she asked, “What’s wrong? Is it full in there?” 
Lin Tian replied heavily, “No, we seem to have entered the demonic forest of the Uninhabited Zone, where it’s full of monsters.” 
Fortunately, he hadn’t used Abnormal Fusion to transform into a human. 
Otherwise, they would’ve ganged up on him immediately. 
After all, within his own territory, humans had long since accepted being ruled by goblins. 
“Monsters? It’s no big deal. If they dare to make a move, I won’t hesitate to slaughter this little monster town,” Alice said indifferently. 
Lin Tian shook his head. “The situation in the Uninhabited Zone is complicated, and we don’t understand it fully yet. I suspect it’s not the chaotic mess people say it is, with no clear ruler. From the looks of this town, where demi-human monsters coexist peacefully in the tavern, it’s highly likely that a stronger monster is in control. If we act rashly, we might be swarmed.” 
Upon hearing this, Alice understood. 
Although Lin Tian had been insulted earlier, it was clear that the monsters here were united and wouldn’t attack each other. 
This meant that Lin Tian wouldn’t face much trouble here. 
But Alice was different. 
Not only was she the humans’ favorite prey, but she also wielded holy powers, a presence that every monster deeply despised. 
If she were discovered, it would spell big trouble. 
“Little girl, what are you doing out here at this late hour?” 
Suddenly, without any warning, a woman’s voice came from behind. 
Alice instantly drew her sword and swung it in the direction of the voice! 
But she hit nothing. 
Standing just over two meters away was a woman dressed in formal attire, wearing a high ponytail, with a well-proportioned figure. 
Her outfit resembled that of a modest middle-class woman, simple yet not overly plain. 
She was dressed conservatively, like a virtuous wife. 
Her delicate face appeared harmless, exuding warmth. 
Her eyes were filled with concern as she looked at Alice. 
Lin Tian was slightly taken aback. How could there be a human here? She seemed just like a kind, gentle neighbor from a small town. 
Something was off—nine out of ten things were wrong. 
And as she appeared, the dense fog around them lightened significantly. 
Lin Tian immediately opened his system to check. 
To his surprise, she was indeed an ordinary human, with almost no combat ability. 
The woman glanced at Lin Tian as if startled. “A goblin?! Come behind me, little girl! I’ll protect you!” 
Lin Tian’s lips twitched, and he spoke with annoyance, “Big Sis, even if I can’t tell what exactly you are, you’re trying to convince me you’re human in a place swarming with Demon Kings?” 
Only a gullible loser would believe that. 
“Demon King? What are you talking about? There’s no Demon King in our little town,” the woman said in confusion as she tried to pull Alice toward the tavern. 
But she couldn’t budge her at all. 
Alice retreated cautiously to Lin Tian’s side. “Just now, I clearly sensed her within my attack range, but after I swung my sword, she was suddenly outside of it. There’s definitely more to her.” 
Lin Tian stopped pretending and came clean. “I don’t know what kind of trick you’re using, but I’ve gained enough confidence in killing monsters, hehehe…” 
Thanks to the holy relic on his body. 
With Judgment Execution—a world-class holy magic skill he had acquired through Lucky Steal—he could unleash divine power. 
Which would greatly suppress monsters. 
At that moment, the commotion outside had caught the attention of those inside. The tavern doors swung open, and several people rushed out. 
Surprisingly, they weren’t monsters but actual humans! 
They looked like ordinary townsfolk. 
Seeing the goblins, they were filled with hatred.  
“Goblins?! Get the weapons, boys!” 
One after another, about a dozen men emerged, armed with chairs, bottles, and fruit knives. 
At this scene, Alice was astonished. “Your Majesty, Lin Tian, didn’t you say they were monsters? Why do they look just like regular human townsfolk? They even seem like humans.” 
“Little girl, come to us quickly! We’ll protect you. Don’t let the goblins deceive you!” the woman called out again, sounding urgent. 
Lin Tian responded calmly, “If you trust me, don’t ask too many questions.” 
There was no way to explain the system to her. 
However, Lin Tian was also surprised. 
Just earlier, the system had identified them as genuine monsters. 
But now, when he checked again, they were normal human townsfolk, all weak and powerless. 
It was indeed strange. Something was definitely interfering, altering their true identities. 
Even the system couldn’t see through it. 
Alice hummed in acknowledgment, then immediately unleashed a sword qi! 
“Shhhh!” 
A middle-aged man fell to the ground, sliced in half! 
Instantly, an elderly man and a young boy beside him collapsed, sobbing uncontrollably. “Why?! Why did you kill my son?!” 
“Papa!”  
The cries were heart-wrenchingly real. 
This reminded Lin Tian of the scenes from his earlier raids on villages. 
What kind of strange thing had they encountered this time?! 
At that moment, the woman’s eyes filled with disgust and fear. “Why did you kill him? As expected, you’re no different from the monsters you’re with. You’ve already become one yourself!” 
Alice said nothing, but unleashed two more slashes of sword qi! 
This time, the group of “humans” instantly transformed into ferocious monsters, scattering in all directions! 
The human Alice had killed on the ground morphed into a blood-red spider with eight legs. Its body and abdomen were sliced apart, and it died on the spot. 
Lin Tian was incredulous. That blood spider should have been at the level of a Demon King just a moment ago. 
Yet it had been killed so easily by Alice’s casual sword qi. There were far too many questions surrounding this. 
After thinking carefully, he started to piece things together. 
It had to be the woman’s magic—something that could completely transform herself and others into someone else, including their combat abilities and physical form. 
Even the system had been fooled by this. 
Such an overwhelming ability—if she were to ascend to godhood, wouldn’t she become a real deity? 
She could impersonate anyone, and not even the most powerful figures would be able to tell the difference! 
There was one distinct advantage, though. 
She could become any type of woman he desired! 
“It looks like I’ll have to capture you and keep you around, hehe…” Lin Tian’s lips curled into a grin. 
A man with a goal suddenly felt unstoppable energy! 
The woman’s gaze was filled with loathing and darkness. She no longer bothered to maintain the facade of a gentle, neighborly big sister. 
Glancing at the corpse of the Blood Spider Demon King, she coldly remarked, “Look at you, killing my servant—what a naughty child…” 
“So you’ve finally admitted it,” Alice responded icily. 
“Judgment… Execution!!!” 
Boom! 
In an instant, holy light exploded! 
It illuminated the entire area, causing the dense fog to vanish in an instant! 
The blast wiped out a dozen twelfth-tier monsters on the spot! 
The ground itself cracked open, creating a terrifying chasm that stretched for thousands of meters, turning everything it touched to ash! 
Only the woman and the Skeleton Demon King managed to avoid the attack. 
Lin Tian’s face was filled with a sinister smile, his eyes narrowing. “I’m very interested in your abilities. Why don’t you stop resisting and let me study you thoroughly?” 
“Holy magic?! From a… goblin?!!”  
The woman’s face was full of shock, her disbelief obvious. 
The Skeleton Demon King was equally astonished. “I’ve seen plenty of strange things in this Uninhabited Zone, but a goblin using holy magic? Now that’s a first! Fascinating!”
