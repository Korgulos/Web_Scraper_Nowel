Chapter 54: The Hunter Team Arrives! The Sword Saintess Was Deceived! 
TL: Sungmin  
“It’s impossible, this makes no sense, come here!” 
Brutal was also bewildered and angrily shouted at the Beast Goblin in the distance. 
Grabbing him by the neck, he harshly demanded, “What do you mean? Wasn’t the ring taken by him?” 
“It was him, the boss. No mistake about it.” The Beast Goblin answered painfully. 
However, looking at Felomon, it seemed he wasn’t lying. 
Brutal was so enraged that he ground his teeth and snapped the Beast Goblin’s neck! 
He prepared to kill everyone and search them one by one. 
Felomon’s heart pounded wildly; he knew the day had come. He slowly closed his eyes. 
“Whoosh!” 
A piercing sound suddenly exploded in the air! 
An arrow wrapped in white light shot from the treetops in the distance. 
It forced Brutal back several steps, leaving scars on his crocodile scale armor, and a few drops of blood seeped out. 
Seeing this, Brutal’s cold eyes looked towards the distance, where a white-clad figure holding a bow stood. 
Opening his mouth wide, he roared angrily, “Who!” 
But suddenly! 
He felt a chill on his head, and the feeling of death rushed at him! 
He quickly dodged to the side. 
“Boom!” 
A platinum holy sword heavily struck the ground where he had been, followed by a slim figure in platinum armor. 
The Sword Saintess, Alicenia! 
She slowly descended from the air, landing steadily with one foot on the sword’s hilt. 
The moment she appeared, those soldiers who thought they were doomed were so excited they almost cried! 
Because she represented the word ‘security’! 
As for the incident in Bright Town, it was purely an accident, everyone understood that. 
Besides, no one would deny the strength of someone who had won 999 times for one failure. 
Brutal looked at the woman with confusion and shock; his biological instincts told him, Danger! Extreme danger! 
A threat to his life. 
Before he could react, he felt something emerging from beneath his feet! 
He could sense a faint vibration. 
“Swish!” 
A long spear pierced through Brutal’s foot, and he endured the severe pain to pull away with difficulty. 
A man with a buzz cut emerged from the ground, wearing tight black armor, holding a long spear still dripping with Brutal’s blood. 
He looked about the same age as the Sword Saintess, around twenty-six or twenty-seven. 
Seeing all this, Brutal’s face became more and more twisted. 
He didn’t know where these troublesome, threatening beings had come from. 
“Do you really need to bully a Goblin like this?” 
Suddenly, a deep, magnetic voice sounded behind Brutal. 
Turning his head, he saw an elderly man in black leather armor carrying a shield and a sword, with short white hair and an eye patch. 
He looked at least sixty or seventy but still appeared robust and imposing. 
From his single eye, it was clear he didn’t take Brutal seriously at all. 
It was full of disdain. 
Brutal couldn’t hold back any longer and roared as he swung his fist fiercely at the old man! 
Seeing this, the old man took down his one-meter-wide sword, resembling a shield, to block. 
“Boom!” 
The impact of the tremendous force stirred up a strong gust! 
The old man stood still, just slightly surprised, “What do young people eat these days to have such strength?” 
Seeing his blow easily blocked, Brutal began to slowly seek an opportunity to retreat. 
He knew none of these people were easy to deal with! 
But just as he was about to escape the encirclement, an arrow grazed his head, nearly blinding him! 
At this moment, Felomon was overwhelmed with excitement, “Lord Sword Saintess! You’ve finally arrived! And the members of the Hunter Team!” 
He recognized them at once. 
They were legendary adventurers! Former teammates of the Sword Saintess! 
In the distance, the archer named ‘Emma’ wasn’t human but an elf. 
She was granted citizenship in the Lionheart Empire and a legendary badge. 
The spearman named ‘Marshall’ also had a legendary badge. 
The elderly man with the shield sword was a member of the imperial family, with the blood of the Lionheart imperial family. 
Named ‘Austin’, he had also earned his legendary badge twenty years ago. 
The others received theirs five or six years ago while teaming up with the Sword Saintess. 
“Didn’t expect the Hunter Team to come; I’m so lucky. Unfortunately, Count Stantmont wasn’t as lucky, sigh!” 
In his joy, Felomon also felt sorrow. 
The Sword Saintess said incredulously, “They were just a group of big variants back then, and now, they’ve evolved to the Overlord level?” 
“Damn, girl, don’t scare me! In less than a year, they went from Big Variant to Overlord?!” Spearman Marshall was taken aback. 
Before coming, he thought a group of mere Goblins was no big deal. 
Hearing this, he found it hard to accept. 
It was unprecedented! 
Alicenia responded irritably, “I said, call me Alice.” 
“Alright, girl, let’s get to work.” 
Marshall chuckled and activated his skill again, ‘Super-tier Combat Skill · Earth Walking Technique.’ 
He directly burrowed into the ground, ready to strike again. 
Brutal became cautious and watched the ground beneath his feet. 
But this time, Marshall emerged from behind, his spear glowing with a golden light as he charged up his attack! 
In that instant, Brutal abruptly turned and grabbed the spear, flinging Marshall away! 
Marshall rolled on the ground a few times, bitterly exclaiming, “Ah, I was careless, embarrassing myself in front of the girl!” 
Brutal launched an attack, thrusting the seized spear towards Austin! 
However, it was once again blocked by Austin’s shield-sword. 
It wasn’t over yet; Austin used a skill, “Scorching Ashes!” 
He spat a mouthful of burning ash, causing Brutal’s eyes to sting and lose sight. 
Next, a sharp pain came from his chest, leaving a deep gash! 
He quickly retreated. 
Austin picked up the spear and tossed it back, “Hold on to it, kid. If you can’t even protect your weapon, how do you expect to protect Alice?” 
Already feeling humiliated, Marshall felt even more ashamed. 
He recalled the embarrassing moments from their past team-ups. 
He had once pursued Alicenia and vowed to protect her in danger. 
In the end, he was the one who constantly needed protection. 
“Stop it, Grandpa Austin. We haven’t seen each other in a long time, give me some face.” Marshall said tearfully. 
He then became serious. 
The two of them began to coordinate their attacks, with Emma shooting arrows from a distance to interfere. 
Brutal’s previous arrogance and frenzy disappeared completely. 
Sweat constantly dripped from his forehead under the immense pressure, a single mistake could lead to injury or even death. 
“Damn, especially that old man. His sword is too heavy; my skin armor can’t withstand it!” 
Brutal thought, trying to find an opportunity to escape. 
Unfortunately, he was so suppressed that he had no chance, and there was still an extremely dangerous woman who hadn’t made a move yet. 
While he was contemplating, an arrow from a distance precisely hit his eye! 
Blood splattered! 
Suddenly blinded, he couldn’t defend against the attacks anymore. 
Taking this opportunity, Austin and Marshall both launched a full-force strike! 
The spear pierced through Brutal’s neck from the side, even emerging from the other side! 
The shield-sword left a horrifying gash on his stomach, exposing his internal organs. 
Brutal screamed in pain, taking a deep breath, “Roar!!!” 
He used Beast King’s Roar again, but this time it was enhanced! 
The effect was the same. 
Austin and Marshall, being too close, were knocked unconscious by the terrifying sound waves! 
Alicenia had been waiting for this moment, which was why she hadn’t attacked. She swung her holy sword, piercing Brutal’s chest! 
“Super-tier Sword Skill · Star and Moon Slash!” 
“Boom!” 
A scorching holy light exploded, creating a hole in Brutal’s chest! 
One could even see the scenery behind through the hole. 
Brutal writhed in pain, grabbing a Goblin and devouring it, activating a new innate skill. 
‘Brutal Nature.’ 
By consuming his kin, he could undergo a high-efficiency healing process. 
The wounds began to heal at a speed visible to the naked eye. 
Austin and Marshall quickly recovered and moved aside. 
Watching him, Marshall couldn’t help but exclaim, “This guy, pierced through the neck and chest, still won’t die?” 
“After all, he’s an Overlord-level. Now a finishing blow will kill him.” 
Alicenia slowly walked over, ready to strike. 
Seeing this, Brutal was so frightened that he crawled back, filled with fear of this woman! 
He quickly pleaded, “Wait! I’m just here for the magic ring, I don’t want to fight. I’ll go back to the Great Tomb now, okay?” 
The Great Tomb was another name for the largest enchanted forest to the west. 
It mainly housed a real ‘tomb’ where creatures feared across the continent lived. 
Hearing this, Alicenia couldn’t help but ask, “Did you say, the Great Tomb?” 
“Yes, yes, I’m just here to retrieve my magic ring, I have no intention of fighting with you all. Blame him for taking my stuff!” 
Brutal now behaved like a compliant child, trying to reason. 
Seeing him point at Felomon, Marshall asked, “Count, what magic ring of his?” 
“I really don’t know. I swear on my knight’s honor, I’ve never touched that thing.” 
Felomon felt wronged, wondering when he had ever stolen something from a Goblin. 
Being labeled as the bad guy. 
Hearing this, Brutal was genuinely baffled. The Beast Goblin had said it himself. 
Unfortunately, he had just killed him and couldn’t ask now. 
But Alicenia sensed something was amiss, “It’s him, it must be him! That extremely troublesome guy!” 
“Who? The Goblin you mentioned earlier? Not this one in front of us?” Austin quickly asked. 
Alicenia thought for a moment and shook her head, “No, this guy says he’s from the Great Tomb, looking for the magic ring, but he is a Goblin living around here.” 
The abduction of over a hundred people from Bright Town indicated. 
It had to be the Goblins living around here who did it. 
It’s impossible to believe that someone came from hundreds or thousands of kilometers away from the Great Tomb just to capture a hundred people. 
“So, this guy was lured here from the Great Tomb by that one’s scheme, hoping we’d weaken each other?” 
At this moment. 
Everyone felt a chill run down their spine! 
Could a Goblin really pull off such a scheme?
