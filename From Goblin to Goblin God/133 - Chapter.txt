Chapter 133: Enhancing Strength, Exchanging Skills 
TL: Sungmin 
“You useless waste, still not dead??” 
“Shush!” 
In the blink of an eye, the Goblin King was once again in Lin Tian’s face. 
His eyes, filled with murderous intent, looked at him with a strange expression. 
But instantly! 
He sensed a strong threat and quickly retreated backward. 
Seeing Gobu Kuang and the others emerging from the shadows, he became highly vigilant! 
Each one of them exuded a fierce aura. 
They were not the high-tier types that could be born in his tribe! 
In disbelief, he asked, “You, you are goblins from which tribe? Wait! You are not from my tribe?!” 
At that moment, he realized. 
“Boss, you finally figured it out.” Lin Tian said with a mischievous smile. 
At first glance! 
The Goblin King noticed an unprecedented terrifying demonic aura emanating from Lin Tian! He was definitely an extremely powerful demon! 
What had he been tormenting just now! 
A mere low-tier form, yet hiding such power. 
He had a premonition he would die here! 
The Rebirth skill now needed a long time to restart, and if he died now, he would truly die! 
“Death Sandstorm!”  
The Goblin King quickly used his skill to buy time to escape. 
He couldn’t die yet; how could he die here? 
His future was limitless! 
As long as he evolved again and again, he could become invincible! 
However. 
Facing the massive sandworms, Lin Tian directly took out the Spear of Zeus, “Divine Thunder Punishment!” 
Although he couldn’t summon lightning here, the stored lightning was enough to cut a path! 
“Boom!” 
A surge of purple lightning burst forth, carving out a wide, straight path through the sandstorm. 
The ground scorched black, and the sandworms on both sides were paralyzed by the electricity, unable to move. 
In almost an instant, Lin Tian and the others rushed in front of the Goblin King, blocking him. 
Gobu Shan’s evil bones unfurled, sealing the entire passage. 
Forming a wall. 
“Don’t force me!” 
The Goblin King prepared to counterattack on the spot but was suppressed by Gobu Kuang’s magic beam attack, retreating repeatedly. 
Lin Tian stabbed fiercely with his spear, and the once-indestructible exoskeleton cracked with one hit! 
With a little more force, he pierced through. 
A large amount of green viscous liquid flowed out, extremely foul-smelling. 
The Goblin King grimaced in pain, “Ah! My exoskeleton, impossible!” 
While shouting, he planned to use his hardest mandibles to bite Lin Tian. 
These black, shiny pincers could even chew through alloy. 
“Shush!” 
Suddenly, a long spear directly pierced his mouth, pinning his head to the bone wall. 
It was Fiona. 
The valiant spear could easily shatter his bones. 
“Let me go, I am a Goblin King, you damned bunch, kneel before me!!” 
The Goblin King screamed in pain, starting to release his skill Command. 
Even goblins not of the same tribe would be controlled by him. 
Goblin Slayer, being of half-human, half-goblin blood, could only control other goblins through the king’s genes sensed in her blood. 
But the true Goblin King was different. He could indiscriminately summon all non-king types with just a skill activation. 
A strange energy wave rippled out. 
Gobu Kuang and the others were all covered by the summon. 
However, it had no effect. 
Because they actually belonged to the Goblin Slayer tribe, and with a king leading them, they wouldn’t be affected by another king. 
“You all?! But this guy? No king’s signal in your body, why aren’t you affected by my control?” 
The Goblin King, in shock, couldn’t understand the situation. 
Lin Tian had never been controlled by Goblin Slayer, and during this period, he had reached the level of a king type without her suppression. 
Though the exact reason was unknown. 
It was certainly closely related to the titles he gained from his interactions with Gobu Yue. 
Unfortunately, he and Gobu Yue couldn’t evolve. 
But their strength conversion far surpassed overlord types. 
Lin Tian coldly looked at him, licking his lips, “I really like your ability the more I see it. Let me see if I can obtain it?” 
“What are you going to do? Wait, I am the Goblin King, don’t kill me, I can serve you! Ahhh!” 
“Rip…” 
Along with his screams, there was the eerie sound of bones and flesh separating. 
Lin Tian fiercely bit off a chunk of flesh from his ugly face. 
However, his exoskeleton was very hard, making it extremely difficult to bite. 
The Goblin King was in excruciating pain, never having suffered such treatment during his long, patient growth. 
Finally, he understood why everyone hated goblins so much! 
He started eating him alive! 
In no time, he had been gnawed half to death, with thick blood oozing from his broken bones. 
“Damn goblin! Stop biting me, it hurts so much!!!” 
The Goblin King screamed shrilly, his whole body convulsing. 
Lin Tian took small bites, fearing that he might consume all the flesh before acquiring the skill. 
‘Ding, congratulations on obtaining the passive skill · Rebirth!’ 
Only then did Lin Tian stop. 
The Goblin King, not yet dead, still had the will to live, “Is it enough? Just spare me, I can…” 
“Alright, Gobu Kuang, just eat him whole.” 
Lin Tian cut him off, giving direct orders. 
There was no way to spare such a creature. If he escaped, he would certainly retaliate fiercely. 
He had to be completely eradicated to avoid future troubles. 
Moreover, the primary purpose this time was to evolve Gobu Kuang. 
“Wait! What are you…!” 
Before he could finish, Gobu Kuang tore off his limbs and stuffed them into his mouth. 
Even parts he couldn’t chew were forcibly swallowed. 
Until nothing remained. 
Nearby. 
Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan devoured the corpses of adventurers and powerful goblins. 
They, too, evolved into overlord variants. 
[Gobu Tian: Lv81<br/>
Race: Goblin<br/>
Profession: Shadow Assassin<br/>
Title: Elf Child, Hunter in the Shadows…<br/>
Health: 1800<br/>
Strength: 899<br/>
Defense: 790<br/>
Skills: Merging into Darkness (completely invisible when stationary in shadows), Shadow Assault (control shadows to attack with 80% of the user’s strength), Ambush, Backstabber…<br/>
Equipment: Void Dagger<br/>
Overall: 6900] 
Overall, there wasn’t much change, but several powerful skills were added. 
Previous skills were, of course, retained. 
Evolution didn’t cause skills to disappear. 
[Gobu Shan: Lv83<br/>
Race: Goblin<br/>
Profession: Bone Warrior<br/>
Title: Undying Battle Bone, Elf Child…<br/>
Health: 2500<br/>
Strength: 810<br/>
Defense: 1000<br/>
Skills: Evil Bones<br/>
Equipment: Athena’s Spear and Shield, Evil Bones<br/>
Overall: 6910] 
He didn’t have many special skills now, but his Evil Bones could change freely, controlling attacks at will. 
They could stab into the ground for a surprise strike, launch long-distance attacks, or transform into a shield. 
One skill equivalent to countless others. 
At this moment. 
Gobu Kuang finally began to change, his bones creaking. 
He was visibly shrinking. 
Dirty bone spikes and tumors on his body fell off. 
He even shed a layer of skin and flesh completely. 
Emerging in a new form from the decayed shell. 
He now resembled the initial state of the Goblin King. 
Like Piccolo from Dragon Ball, his deep green, lizard-like skin was granular. 
However, he was more robust, resembling a classic bodybuilding champion. 
He also grew four arms. 
The two hands on his back that once held demonic flames had withered, transforming into blue and purple veins. 
These extended to all four arms. 
Giving him a highly aesthetic biological appearance. 
Now, with these four hands, he could conjure magic balls effortlessly. 
His combat power directly surged to 8,000! 
Even surpassing Lin Tian in some aspects, as he consumed the most flesh and transformed into the ultimate goblin tier. 
The King Variant. 
He gained two new innate skills: ‘Dim Beam’ and ‘King’s Domain’. 
Evolving from High Pressure Domain to Demonic Domain, now to King’s Domain. 
Dim Beam was purely a magical attack. 
King’s Domain was a buff effect, weakening opponents’ attributes and enhancing his own. During the domain, all his skills would be amplified. 
For instance, Dim Beam could amplify to ‘Ultimate Dim Light’, causing blindness and loss of all senses in the target. 
Not only could he amplify himself, but also his teammates. 
Lin Tian’s Ruinous Howl could amplify to ‘Ultimate Roar’, with greater range and power. 
Seeing the sharp-eyed, imposing Gobu Kuang. 
Everyone felt a bit unfamiliar. 
He looked different from his previous big, dumb self. 
“Boss, I finally got smaller! Hahaha!” 
However, when his familiar, honest voice rang out, everyone knew they had overthought it. 
He was still himself. 
Lin Tian smiled in satisfaction, “Good that you got smaller, let’s move on.” 
Fiona sighed in awe, “I never expected goblins to have such great potential. If every tribe developed like yours, the world might be ruled by goblins.” 
“Easy to say, but for thousands of years, when have goblins ever ruled the world or caused significant impacts? They’re not even a match for your race’s talents.” 
Lin Tian replied. 
If he hadn’t been a transmigrator, he would have died during his first transmigration. The Goblin Empire talk was nonsense. 
Their potential was great, but the difficulty of developing them was hellish. 
Unlike centaurs, who easily exceeded 6 to 7,000 in strength upon maturity. 
Nor humans, who, with a large population, produced top-tier geniuses and strong individuals. 
These geniuses would then pioneer skills, knowledge, and equipment. 
Leading other humans to grow stronger. 
They were far from gods, born as world rulers, their existence meant to toy with the lives of the weak. 
To toy with the world’s rules. 
Lin Tian then mounted Fiona and began heading out. 
It was about time to go back. The strength of the Goblin Empire had developed beyond expectations. It was time to annex those countries that previously caused trouble. 
To declare to the continent the establishment of the Goblin Empire. 
Upon reaching land. 
This time, Gobu Kuang directly activated King’s Domain, unfolding a magic array about 500 meters in range. 
The sandworms in the area dared not emerge. 
They could strut through easily. 
On the way. 
Lin Tian, naturally displeased with Gobu Kuang’s strength surpassing his own. 
After a long time, he reopened the system store. 
This time he had 500 life points, enough to exchange for many items.
