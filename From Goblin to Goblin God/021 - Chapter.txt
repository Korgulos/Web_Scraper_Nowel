Chapter 21: The Arrival of the Imperial Knights 
TL: Sungmin 
Lin Tian, unhurried, continued speaking, “Harassment is not an attack. You just need to stay far away and let them see that there are dragons around Bright Town.” 
The purpose of this move was simple. 
It was to keep the Sword Saintess and the incoming human reinforcements occupied. 
To let them know that dragons might launch another attack at any time, preventing them from going out to search for goblins. 
This would buy enough time to cultivate a large number of third-generation goblins. 
“So, we do the harassing, but what about you guys? I really want to hear why a group of small goblins dare to target that mad woman.” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother asked again. 
Lin Tian thought for a moment and said they needed to create a large number of hero-level goblins to fight against Bright Town. 
After saying this, 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother also weighed the pros and cons. Generally speaking, she wouldn’t lose any more dragons, and the battles would be fought by goblins later. 
Finally, her eyes lit up with satisfaction, “Alright, let’s join forces then.” 
“In that case, may I ask you, Dragon Mother, to arrange a ride for me? How do I get back?” 
Lin Tian asked somewhat awkwardly. It was so high and so far away that it looked quite daunting. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother snapped her fingers, and a wyvern flew over, “From now on, she will be at your service, staying with your tribe. Remember to treat her well; she’s just reached adulthood.” 
A personal ride? No, a personal dragon?! 
Lin Tian’s heart raced with excitement. This was amazing! 
He hadn’t expected such a pleasant cooperation with the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother! 
As he mounted the wyvern and was about to leave, he couldn’t help but ask, “By the way, Dragon Mother, since you’ve reached your breeding period, I haven’t seen any other ancient dragons like you on this island. It can’t be…” 
Compared to the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s size, these wyverns… 
Even if the whole dragon went inside, she probably wouldn’t feel a thing, right? 
“Are you trying to make me eat you? These wyverns compared to me are like you low-level goblins compared to humans.” 
“At most, you have a year. After that, I have to return to the ancient dragon clan to lay eggs. So, hurry up.” 
After saying this, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother turned around to enjoy her feast of cattle and sheep. 
A year? 
Lin Tian thought for a while; it was about right in this world. 
But according to what she said, there was a place similar to this dragon island composed of ancient dragons? 
How many such gigantic dragons would there be? 
Even the Sword Saintess probably couldn’t match them. 
Just thinking about it made him fearful. 
Then he rode the wyvern back to the tribe. 
The intelligence of these dragons was about the same as low-level goblins, so they could understand simple commands. 
Handling them was also quite easy. 
“So, this is what freedom feels like?!” 
Above the clouds, Lin Tian felt he was riding the wind, not the dragon! 
Passing through the white clouds, the blue sky seemed within reach. 
Diving down at high speed, the splashes of water sparkled, forming small rainbows. 
After an exhilarating journey, he finally arrived at the enchanted forest. 
“Alert!!!” 
Gobu Tian of the Tian Kuang Tribe shouted, his heart pounding as he watched the huge figure swooping through the sky. 
Lia was equally shocked, “A dragon! It’s a dragon! Why is it here?” 
“A wyvern? Has something happened in Bright Town?” Loder also asked in confusion. 
The wyvern circled above the tribe, each flap of its wings making the trees sway, almost uprooting them. 
Loder struggled desperately, “Let me go! If it breathes dragon fire, we’re all dead!” 
“Dragon fire? What?!” 
Lia also began to panic, trying hard to open the cage. 
At this moment, they heard Lin Tian’s voice, “Everyone, calm down. It’s me, I’m back.” 
The wyvern slowly descended, landing in a haystack at the edge of the tribe. 
Lin Tian got down and gently soothed it, “Rest here for now, don’t wander off.” 
“Snort!” 
The wyvern snorted as if agreeing. 
“This, this is impossible! A trash goblin can actually ride a dragon?!” 
Loder’s eyes almost popped out! 
He’d rather believe he was dead than accept what he was seeing! 
Beast tamers were rare throughout the empire, and dragon tamers were even rarer. 
Yet now a low-level goblin had ridden a dragon back. 
If he had a stick, Loder would have knocked himself out. 
Seeing this, Gobu Yue and the others breathed a sigh of relief, “Long live the boss! So cool!” 
“This guy, is he really a goblin?” 
Lia couldn’t help but smile bitterly; her heart had almost jumped out just now. 
Gobu Tian and Gobu Kuang were so excited, waving their arms and shouting. 
“Boss, where did you go?” 
Gobu Tian asked curiously, eyeing the resting dragon. 
Lin Tian didn’t explain much and instead asked, “How is the breeding work I asked you to do?” 
“All done, boss.” 
Gobu Yue spoke up, saying that in the past few days, they had released the elves one by one for impregnation without any incidents. 
Lin Tian nodded and then went back to his hut and fell asleep. 
He had been traveling a lot recently and needed some rest. 
At least the greatest danger had been pushed back a bit, allowing him to take a breather. 
… 
In Bright Town. 
After more than half a month of reconstruction, the town had mostly recovered. 
However, to mourn the dozens of people who died and to serve as a reminder to everyone, their tombstones were placed in the middle of the town. 
Everyone who passed by saw them, constantly reminding them that an attack could happen at any moment. 
The Sword Saintess stood alone atop the highest bell tower in the town, her hands holding a sword behind her, standing tall and majestic like a statue. 
She often stood there without moving for an entire day. 
Many people tried to persuade her, but her response was that it was her negligence that led to the deaths of so many people. 
She shouldn’t have focused solely on slaying the dragon and ignored the issues within the town. 
Suddenly! 
A rapid clatter of hooves sounded outside the town! 
The Sword Saintess’s body moved slightly but then resumed its position. 
She lightly leapt down from the bell tower, over ten meters high, and quickly dashed to the city wall to greet the approaching group. 
The Imperial Knights! 
All of them were elite warriors carefully cultivated by the imperial family! 
There were fifteen of them in total, which, compared to an adventurer team, was equivalent to a Diamond-level force. 
They were divided into three parts: the Silver Blade Knights and the Battle Roar Knights. 
Each of these two teams had seven members. 
The remaining one was the Death Knight, Kasimov. 
He wore a pitch-black, tattered medieval armor, obscuring his appearance, but the chilling aura he exuded was very intimidating. 
He seemed like a misfit. 
“Even Kasimov is here? Looks like things are getting interesting.” The Sword Saintess spoke softly. 
Upon seeing her, the members of the knight teams took off their helmets and bowed deeply, “Sword Saintess.” 
“Do you think I wanted to come? Such a fuss for that guy.” Kasimov said coldly. 
Then he walked into the town alone without speaking. 
The Silver Blade Captain had curly red hair, a handlebar mustache, and a roguish look. He smiled and said, “Sword Saintess, it’s an honor to see you again. I admit I am once again captivated by your beauty. How about giving me a chance?” 
“Shut up, you curly-haired fool. You’re just a worker for the imperial family, and you dare to speak to the Sword Saintess like that?” 
At this point, a bald middle-aged man nearby spoke angrily. 
Despite being bald, his armor couldn’t hide his strong muscles. 
Indeed, his baldness made him stronger. 
He was the leader of the Battle Roar Knights. 
The Silver Blade Captain looked aggrieved, “What are you talking about? Who wouldn’t be attracted to the Sword Saintess? In this world, is expressing love not allowed anymore? Oh no! It’s too dark! Too cruel! Too despicable!” 
“Get lost, you pervert.” The Battle Roar Captain grumbled, pushing him away. 
At this moment, the Sword Saintess spoke, “Since you have arrived, stay here. I need to personally go to the enchanted forest.” 
“The imperial family said they want Loder alive or dead, but he’s likely dead. So could you please bring his body back?” The Battle Roar Captain quickly called out. 
Upon hearing this, the Silver Blade Captain snorted, “Dead or alive? If goblins captured him, even his bones would be gnawed clean. Our task is to slay the dragon and then wipe out those goblins.” 
“I understand. Give me three days, and I’ll slaughter all the goblin tribes in the surrounding enchanted forest!” The Sword Saintess’s voice had a hint of anger. 
Everyone felt a chill in their hearts. 
They dared not say anything more. 
But suddenly, a terrifying dragon roar sounded from the distant sky! 
The earth and sky trembled! 
“What is that thing? It’s huge!” 
“Don’t tell me we’re here to slay that thing!” 
The knights were stunned, involuntarily taking half a step back. 
The Silver Blade Captain’s roguish expression returned, “It’s an ancient dragon? No wonder even the Sword Saintess couldn’t handle it properly.” 
“My goodness! I’ve always heard ancient dragons were huge, but this is too big! Prepare for battle!” 
The Battle Roar Captain’s voice reached a high pitch as he commanded. 
Everyone drew their weapons, remaining on high alert. 
The Sword Saintess also stopped her departure, staring coldly into the distance. This time, she would personally slay that creature. 
But they were at a standoff for a long time. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother didn’t come too close to Bright Town. 
She just circled around the town, flying for about an hour before leaving. 
“What’s the situation? Could it be observing us?” 
“Probably. These beasts might be preparing for an attack.” 
“Damn it, causing trouble as soon as we arrive. If it’s going to attack, let it come quickly so we can deal with it and rest!” 
Everyone remained on high alert, their nerves stretched taut. 
The Sword Saintess then prepared to take action herself to kill those goblins and restore her reputation. 
But the Battle Roar Captain called her, “Wait, Sword Saintess. If I’m not mistaken, that was a female dragon, right? Which means there could be a male dragon on Dragon Island.” 
“If two dragons come out, we might not be fully prepared to handle them, at least not to ensure the safety of all the residents.” 
Upon hearing this. 
The Sword Saintess was about to say something but then swallowed her words. 
Last time, only the female dragon had caused significant losses on Dragon Island. 
If it dared to covet this place again, there might indeed be two dragons, or even more. 
But she couldn’t suppress her urge to eliminate those goblins and clear the enchanted forest. 
She said, “Isn’t Kasimov still here? He has the strength.” 
“That lunatic? Let’s not count on him. Since he returned from Death Valley, he’s been like a different person.” The Silver Blade Captain spoke irritably. 
Back then, the Death Knight Regiment received orders to hunt down enemy invaders in Death Valley, but only Kasimov returned. 
Later, they learned it was the strongest knight team from the enemy empire. 
Kasimov’s return proved his formidable strength. 
The Sword Saintess was displeased but ultimately held back. She didn’t care about Loder’s life or death, but she had to restore her lost honor. 
She pondered, “Then I’ll stay here. The Silver Blade Knights will be responsible for hunting down the goblins who captured Loder.” 
“That works. As expected, the Sword Saintess is thoughtful. We’ll start the search tomorrow!” The Silver Blade Captain smiled knowingly. 
In the following days, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother continued to harass Bright Town, putting immense pressure on them. 
Some residents even moved directly into shelters, afraid to go out. 
Meanwhile, the Silver Blade Knights rode their warhorses into the nearby enchanted forest, starting to cleanse and inspect the goblin tribes. 
They slaughtered any goblins they encountered. 
Doing their best to find Loder.
