Chapter 186: Arrival at the Troy Empire! 
TL: Sungmin 
“I!” 
Seeing everyone around her becoming increasingly aggressive. 
Joan knew she had no other choice. Indeed, the state of the Goblin Empire was truly different from what she had imagined! 
She even felt a tinge of envy. 
Then she said, “I naturally won’t go back on my word; cutting off my own limbs is no big deal!” 
“Divine Domain, activate!” 
Whoosh! 
In an instant, the ground revealed seven dazzling magic circles, radiating in brilliant colors. 
They spread out for a kilometer, an utterly breathtaking sight! 
Moreover, golden runes floated within these magic circles, incredibly peculiar, as if they were alive, dancing around like lively spirits. 
The One-Eyed Owl and the others felt a heavy pressure, as if they could barely breathe. 
Even Lin Tian was on high alert, asking, “What are you going to do?” 
Joan coldly snorted, “Don’t compare me to you lowly monsters and fallen beings! Without a solid reason, I wouldn’t kill you. This time, I’ll concede defeat.” 
After speaking, she controlled a rune, allowing it to slowly approach her arm. 
The moment the rune merged with her arm, a sharp “crack!” echoed out! 
A piercing sound of bones breaking. 
But it wasn’t over yet. 
Three more identical runes approached. 
Her other limbs were all broken as well! 
Joan collapsed to the ground, sweating profusely from the pain, and said with difficulty, “I’ve fulfilled my promise!” 
Immediately, she controlled four more runes to come near her. 
In the blink of an eye, her broken limbs were restored! 
It was miraculous! 
Shocking! 
A kind of power never before seen! 
Everyone was dumbfounded, utterly incredulous. 
Even Lin Tian was speechless. Indeed, she had broken her limbs, but it didn’t stop her from healing them instantly. 
Following that, the Divine Domain was closed. 
Joan gave Lin Tian a cold, indifferent glare, “I’ll keep watching you! This time was just a mistake. Next time, I will ensure your death!” 
As she finished speaking, the sound of hooves echoed in the sky. 
A white-winged unicorn appeared, stepping through the air, carrying Joan away. 
“This is the power of a god? Without logic, unrestrained, overwhelmingly powerful…” 
Lin Tian muttered, still in shock from what had just transpired. 
The gap between mortals and gods was truly insurmountable. 
The One-Eyed Owl was still trembling with fear, “Luckily, that woman holds to her so-called justice. If she had wanted to kill us earlier, we wouldn’t have survived.” 
This was the very thing she had feared before. 
The divine domain of a god. 
Unless you escaped during the moment it was being cast, you would undoubtedly die. 
“As far as I know, every demigod’s Divine Domain is different, and the gods’ domains are even more unimaginable,” Osius added, still shaken. 
Having traveled through many nations, this was the first time he had witnessed a true Divine Domain. 
Just standing within it felt like having your head placed on a guillotine! 
A gleaming blade hanging above. 
You could die at any moment. 
Lin Tian stared at the distant figure of Joan, deep in thought, “Is there really no way to fight against these demigods?” 
He needed to devour demigods to evolve, but the overwhelming power gap was simply impossible to bridge. 
Moreover, he had to find a way to kill Joan! 
Otherwise, he wouldn’t be able to swallow this humiliation. 
The Goblin Empire would become a laughingstock, allowing humans to cause havoc within its territory. 
The One-Eyed Owl spoke slowly, “The heroes of Troy—their Hero’s Power can shatter a demigod’s Divine Domain, creating a mutual counterbalance. However, the people of the Troy Empire are exceedingly arrogant, and asking for their help is out of the question.” 
“I see, perhaps there’s a way.” Lin Tian squinted, thinking of something. 
Earlier, the Troy Empire had sent envoys, proposing a collaboration. 
As it happened, they should be arriving soon. 
With that, everyone returned to the main city. 
Many of the monsters and demihumans were in a state of panic, terrified by Joan and afraid to leave their homes, some even considering moving away. 
“Is the Goblin King dead, killed by Joan?” 
“Do you even need to ask? She’s a demigod! They must all be dead. We should escape while Joan hasn’t returned!” 
“Pride comes before a fall! To provoke a demigod, especially Joan, who is famous for punishing evil and upholding justice! That woman’s insane. If you’re marked by her, it’s all over!” 
For a moment, the entire city was abuzz with anxiety. 
At this time, Lin Tian arrived at his statue and said in a loud voice, “Everyone, don’t panic. Joan will never step foot in this city again! I promise you!” 
“Huh?! The Goblin King isn’t dead!” A demihuman exclaimed in surprise. 
Quickly, everyone gathered around to take a look. 
To return alive after facing a demigod truly shocked them. 
They all felt much more at ease. 
Lin Tian continued, “Don’t worry. Joan of Arc? When the time comes, I’ll show you all that even a demigod is only fit to kneel before a Goblin!” 
“Hmph, overestimating yourself. You’re just a mere goblin, yet you dare speak so arrogantly? That’s a demigod! How foolish and ignorant!” 
At this moment, the entire Boarmen tribe, several hundred of them, had packed their belongings and were preparing to leave. 
Their leader, looking shrewd, said, “Bunch of fools. I won’t be sticking around to collect your corpses.” 
They hurriedly made their way toward the city gates. 
“Boom!” 
In the next second. 
The gates slammed shut with a thunderous noise, startling the Boarmen and causing their hearts to leap with fear. 
The boarman leader panicked immediately, “What… what are you doing? Is the Goblin Empire so shameless? You won’t even let us leave? Everyone else is watching!” 
The demihumans and monsters around looked tense. 
Some were starting to panic. 
Lin Tian signaled to Gobu Kuang, who quickly led his men to surround the Boarmen. 
Lin Tian then said, “I said the Goblin Empire allows free passage, but if you choose to leave, don’t do it with a foul mouth. I could hear you spreading rumors and causing unrest from a mile away.” 
“S-sorry, Your Majesty the Goblin King! I didn’t mean to insult you… it’s just a habit of mine to speak like that…” 
The boarman leader, terrified, fell to his knees, his whole body trembling with fear. 
He kept his head low, not daring to look Lin Tian in the eye. 
Lin Tian snorted, “Remember this in your next life: you can eat whatever you want, but you can’t just say whatever you want.” 
The boarman leader nodded frantically, “Y-yes, I’ll remember that.” 
Suddenly, he realized something was wrong, “N-next life? Your Majesty, please, give me a chance!” 
“No, no, you misunderstood. I’m not just going to kill you. Do it.”  
Lin Tian made a hand gesture indicating execution. 
Rumormongers who stirred up unrest could not be allowed to live. 
This had to be a public execution. 
Amid the screams of the Boarmen, the entire tribe—men, women, and children—was slaughtered. 
The other monsters trembled in fear. 
Lin Tian continued, “If you don’t believe that Joan will never come back, you’re free to leave this city. But if you return, you’ll have to pay a 90% tax…” 
Hearing this. 
The crowd looked conflicted; only a few believed him, while others were still considering it. 
Some had already packed up and were cautiously making their way out of the city. 
But just as they were about to leave, they saw, from afar, a massive caravan arriving outside the city gates, forming a line so long it seemed endless! 
“W-what’s going on?” 
“Those people… they look human! But they’re not soldiers; they’re merchants!” 
“Oh my god, it’s the Giant Elephant Empire! The Holy Tree Empire! And… the Troy Empire! How is this possible?! Why are their caravans coming here?!” 
The demihumans were stunned. They had never seen so many caravans from different races coming to the Goblin City. 
Such a massive trade caravan could only mean one thing. 
This city was incredibly safe! 
Even safer than other monster empires, second only to the super monster empires like the Insect Empire or the Elf Empire. 
But entering those empires was extremely difficult for other demihumans and monsters, and staying there long-term was even harder unless they were strong, well-connected, or highly valuable. 
But now. 
The Goblin Empire had attracted trade caravans from three human great empires, showing that the safety level here had surpassed even the super monster empires. 
Seeing this. 
The monsters who had planned to leave quickly stepped aside. 
At the forefront of the caravan was the Troy Empire’s delegation, bearing their iconic ‘Golden Triangle Eye’ banner, symbolizing Troy’s sacred relic, the ‘Eye of Millennium.’ 
The triangle represented courage, honesty, and love. 
Leading the group was a contingent of Trojan heroes—muscular, dark-skinned men walking barefoot. 
They resembled Egyptians, though they were not quite the same. 
The women, on the other hand, had very fair skin. 
They wore luxurious gold jewelry, such as bracelets and anklets, which reflected their nation’s distinct cultural essence. 
A hallmark of Trojan heroes was the ‘Eye of Millennium’ mark, which could appear anywhere on their bodies. 
As for where the mark would appear, it was random. 
However, this group of Trojan heroes had been carefully selected, ensuring that their marks were hidden. 
To avoid giving themselves away. 
“Greetings, Your Majesty the Goblin King. I am the president of the Troy Empire’s Merchant Guild. We will strictly follow your rules and ensure no mistakes are made.” 
At that moment. 
A slender, captivating young woman with fair, bare feet stepped forward to speak. 
Lin Tian stared intently at this group, relieved with his system; otherwise, he would have been completely in the dark. 
Were these merchant guild members all so ridiculously powerful? 
Their average combat power was 9,500! 
The highest among them, even surpassing 10,000. 
And it was this delicate-looking guild president who had the highest power.

Seeing this overwhelming combat power, which was even 999 points higher than the One-Eyed Owl’s. 
And similar to Veronica, also a Spirit Summoner. 
Lin Tian almost cursed out loud. Were these people playing dirty? Was this a trade mission or a declaration of war?! 
Sending such a powerful group into the city—no need to guess how malicious their intentions were. 
But there was no rush to tear off the facade. Now that he knew their true intentions, he could seize the initiative and slowly dismantle these people.
