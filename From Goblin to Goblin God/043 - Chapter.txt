Chapter 43: The Sword Saintess’s Tears 
TL: Sungmin 
“Alright, I agree with you. I just didn’t expect a low-level goblin to possess such intelligence to communicate this way,” Lilith said straightforwardly. 
A trace of a sly smile flashed in Lin Tian’s heart. 
It definitely couldn’t be rushed now; to test it, he had to slowly develop her feelings. 
He then explained the situation there and made some agreements with them. 
Lilith and the others were arranged perfectly, to the point where they felt a bit moved.  
“I appreciate your actions. As long as the invaders in your cave aren’t too strong, we will do our best to help,” Lilith said. 
“Then, here’s to a pleasant cooperation,” Lin Tian extended his hand. 
At that moment, Lilith’s expression showed a surprising change. 
Human-like habits! 
Although she was a vampire, she had been human before becoming one. 
Lilith then added, “No wonder the Sword Saintess was driven to isolation by you. Of course, we mean strong opponents like her.” 
“I understand. By the way, what’s the deal with the count you mentioned?” Lin Tian asked tentatively. 
After all, it was akin to cuckolding someone’s wife, and several at that! 
If he was very strong and came for revenge, it would be disastrous. 
Lilith’s face showed obvious sadness as she said, “He is our husband, a vampire who has lived for thousands of years. Unfortunately, he is imprisoned in the temple by the Church… The Church spared us from punishment as we were forced to become vampires.” 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian roughly understood. 
Since he was imprisoned by the Holy Church, there was no need to worry about him escaping for now. 
Lin Tian looked at her and said with concern, “Don’t worry, when I become strong enough, I’ll go overthrow the Church. You see, even a Saintess of the Church has been completely subdued by me.” 
“Really, really?” Lilith’s face showed the expression of a virtuous wife, not expecting someone to be willing to help her husband. 
Lin Tian nodded, “Absolutely true. You’re also tired, go rest now.” 
He then supported her delicate, fair hand and led her into a small cave. 
The vampires behind them looked at Lin Tian differently. 
After Lin Tian left, he heard the group of vampires discussing. 
“Oh my, how can I see romance and responsibility in a goblin?” 
“Seriously, I could cry, who understands?” 
“After wandering for hundreds of years, now given a place to settle by a goblin. Madam, don’t you think he is reliable?” 
The group of vampires, being women, immediately switched to gossip mode. 
Lilith, however, remained steadfast, “Stop it. We belong to the Count, we can’t do this. If anyone talks about not waiting for the Count to come out, I can’t help her.” 
At the cave entrance, Lin Tian slowly revealed a smug smile. 
This was the charm of a virtuous wife. 
Maintaining chastity, resisting strongly, but ultimately falling step by step into the clutches, unable to extricate herself. 
It was almost like gaining a virgin bride. 
Lin Tian left the small cave with a wicked smile, planning to take a nap. 
For now, there was no rush. 
… 
In Bright Town, the tavern was brightly lit all night. 
Many people stayed up, waiting for news from the Cold-Blooded Mercenaries. 
But by dawn, there was no news. 
The tavern owner sighed, “I think they failed too. Everyone go rest, I can’t hold on any longer. If you want to drink, serve yourselves and remember to pay.” 
Upon hearing this, the others didn’t show any sign of fatigue. 
Instead, they were filled with fear. 
They couldn’t accept the repeated defeats! 
Even the vampires, who were immortal, had failed.  
Only holy attacks could cause fatal damage to them. 
Slowly, everyone’s eyes turned to the Wandering Hero. 
He was now the only Diamond-level adventurer here. 
Feeling the pressure of their gazes, the Wandering Hero quickly said, “Why are you all looking at me? I’m here to slay dragons, who cares about those goblins! If you want to fight, can’t you gather all your strength and attack together?” 
“But how would we split the bounty?” The bald man asked. 
Most adventurers, nine out of ten, were in it for the money. 
Otherwise, who would risk their lives? 
The goblin disaster had nothing to do with them, it was all about the bounty. 
The Wandering Hero snorted, “Do whatever you want, I’m not interested.” 
“Coward.” 
A voice suddenly echoed in the tavern, then quickly faded. 
The Wandering Hero was so angry he jumped up, “Which bastard! Am I a coward? Am I! I’m here to slay dragons; goblins are trash not worth my time!” 
No one in the tavern responded. 
Just when they thought the tavern had quieted down, several voices rang out again, “Coward.” 
“Who the hell are you fooling?” 
“Diamond-level? More like dog shit!” 
This caused the tavern to erupt into a noisy uproar. 
In a corner of Bright Town, there was a dilapidated little house. 
The interior was simple, with a gray little bed, a cracked wooden table, and a single stool. 
In the corner was a dusty platinum longsword and a pile of armor. 
Because of the loud commotion in the tavern, the Sword Saintess slowly woke up. 
At this moment, her golden hair was disheveled, not knowing how long she had been lying there. 
Though awake, she didn’t sit up. 
Her blue eyes stared blankly at the ceiling, lost in thought. 
Suddenly, she noticed something under the door crack. 
It was an envelope from that mysterious person. 
After hesitating for a long time, the Sword Saintess decided to check it. 
Throwing off the covers, she had already removed her armor and was wearing a casual white nightgown. 
Her slender waist seemed like it could be gripped with one hand. 
The nightgown only covered up to her thighs, revealing a captivating expanse of white skin. 
Her jade-like feet were as tender as a baby’s skin, an excellent product for soaking in milk. 
However, there were faint scars on the soles of her feet. 
These were from when she realized she had been tricked at the broken bridge and had to sprint back dozens of miles within half an hour. 
At the time, she didn’t notice her feet had become a bloody mess. 
When she got out of bed, the Sword Saintess staggered and almost fell. 
She smiled bitterly, “How long have I been lying here? I can’t even feel my legs.” 
She then picked up the letter. 
Upon seeing the image of a lion with its mouth wide open on the cover, she knew who had sent it. 
It was from the Emperor of the Lionheart Empire, Emperor Lionheart. 
To: Alicenia 
I heard your powerful sword will was defeated by a group of goblins. I know that isn’t the case. 
You were defeated by yourself. I told you long ago, don’t be too hard on yourself. 
Sometimes it’s okay to go wild, to forget yourself. 
Be like a lion. 
…—Emperor Lionheart, Charles II 
Reading these lines, a blue tear, as blue as the ocean, inexplicably rolled down the corner of the Sword Saintess’s eye. 
She had even forgotten that her name was Alicenia. 
“Yes, I am Alicenia. I am not just a sword, I am a person.” 
Alicenia muttered to herself, her expression subtly changing. 
From her ocean-like eyes that embraced her people, it wasn’t tears that flowed. 
It was herself. 
She was crying for herself. 
After a long daze, her gaze finally turned to the dusty sword in the corner. 
At this moment, the tavern was still noisy. 
The Wandering Hero, exhausted from arguing with everyone, was left breathless. 
He was being verbally attacked from all sides. 
An old man then spoke up, “This coward, I’ve had enough of him. Hiding in the corner pretending to be a master for so long, and what do we get? A worthless piece of shit!” 
“Old man, do you want to die?” 
Finally, the Wandering Hero could no longer bear it. A white ball of light appeared in his hand! 
He was ready to use force to shut them up. 
But then he saw a familiar figure standing at the door, tall and imposing like a mountain! 
The Sword Saintess!! 
The Wandering Hero quickly retracted his attack, forced a smile, and bowed, “Sword Saintess! It’s great that you’ve recovered!” 
“Sword Saintess!?” 
Everyone turned their heads, and upon seeing it was the Sword Saintess, they almost jumped with excitement! 
But no one forgot their respect, all bowing in greeting. 
In the Lionheart Empire, only the Emperor received the same level of respect as the Sword Saintess. 
Her path of protection was admired and respected by everyone. 
Alicenia gestured for them to be quiet, “I am glad you have come to support Bright Town. Everyone, it’s time to put an end to this. I will not give them any more chances to breathe!” 
She had originally planned to deal with Dragon Island and then the goblins alone. 
Now, with so many people, it was much easier. 
“Ah, this…” 
Hearing this, everyone looked a bit embarrassed. 
Support? 
They weren’t here for charity work! 
But since the Sword Saintess had spoken, they were too embarrassed to clarify. 
The tavern owner sighed, “Are you still adventurers? If you are willing to help, you can drink all the wine in my tavern! Drink until you’re full!” 
“Alright!” 
“We’ll do whatever the Sword Saintess says!” 
“Clear out those who threaten Bright Town!” 
“Boss, you are generous. Actually, we would follow the Sword Saintess anyway.” 
Hearing everyone’s fighting spirit, two more groups of adventurers walked in from outside. 
The leader was named ‘Edison’, dressed like a western gunslinger, with a simple flintlock pistol at his waist. 
But he was a Diamond-level adventurer, leading a team called ‘The Gunslingers’. 
The other group was also Diamond-level. 
Edison spoke first, “I am willing to help the Sword Saintess uphold the path of protection. It’s just a little effort, count me in.” 
“Diamond-level! Great!” 
Someone exclaimed with joy. 
But some were indifferent, “With the Sword Saintess in action, isn’t it a given we can handle a bunch of goblins?” 
Upon hearing this, everyone realized. 
They all sighed, “I almost thought he was showing off. Isn’t he just here to help out?” 
With the Sword Saintess doing the heavy lifting, wasn’t everyone else just assisting? 
Or rather, they were just freeloading for glory. 
“No, this time we will split into two groups. One will deal with the goblins, the other with Dragon Island.” 
Alicenia interrupted them. 
Edison, who had been deflated, straightened up again, “Humph, who did you say was here to freeload? Don’t team up with me.” 
“Sword Saintess, how should we split the teams?” the Wandering Hero asked.
