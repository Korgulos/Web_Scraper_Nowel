Chapter 245: Take the Initiative When You See Someone Attractive! 
TL: Sungmin  
“How about this?!” 
One of the Alices immediately activated her holy power, with several rings of light rising from her feet to shield her! 
The wind howled! 
Without a doubt. 
The other Alice could do the same. 
Even the holy power could be mimicked—not just mimicked, but perfectly replicated! 
The Skeleton Demon King stood by, laughing coldly, “How about that, country bumpkin? Scared stiff by our master’s power, huh? If you kneel and beg to be her slave, maybe—just maybe—our master will let you off~” 
The Lust Demon King was considered one of the milder Great Lords of Sin. 
After all, she was obsessed with pleasure. 
Regardless of gender, age, or even species—be it beast, human, or monster—if she found someone appealing, she would seduce them and copy their form as a template. Later, she could transform into that person at any time. 
This allowed her to seduce others again and again. 
It was because she found Alice’s appearance exquisite that she had shown up, hoping to lure her in. 
And most importantly, the Lust Demon King was even more potent than a goblin in that regard. 
Through intercourse, she could absorb her partner’s soul, strengthening herself. She could kill them or turn them into her slaves. 
“Lin Tian, don’t worry about me. You go back first. I don’t believe she’ll follow us all the way back and keep hanging around,” Alice said gravely. 
The other Alice chimed in, “I won’t be going back. If you see me again, attack me immediately!” 
The Skeleton Demon King continued to sneer, “Kekeke, this is the price of angering our master! So, what are you going to do now?” 
“What to do? Double the pleasure—what do you think I should do?” 
Suddenly, the tense atmosphere was shattered by Lin Tian’s mischievous laughter. 
With an evil grin on his face, he said, “Come on, Alice, get on the ground. I want to see if a great Demon King will let herself be humiliated by a country bumpkin like me…” 
Before he could finish speaking, both Alices were already prepared. 
Lin Tian’s face froze. He had miscalculated—the Lust Demon King was notorious for being shameless, and this method wouldn’t work at all. 
So, he changed tactics, “Lust Demon King, huh? Anyway, your magic won’t work while you’re engaging in… ‘fun.’ Let’s see if you can hold out without giving yourself away.” 
“Thud!” 
Immediately. 
One of the Alices’ expressions changed visibly. 
Slowly, white smoke began to rise from her body as her true form reemerged. 
Scarlett couldn’t believe it, “How… how did you know about my abilities?” 
Although she could copy someone’s memory, it would vanish after she reverted back to her original form. 
That’s why she hadn’t directly copied Lin Tian’s memory to find the answer—she would’ve forgotten it right afterward. 
“Bang!” 
Without warning, Lin Tian smashed the Skeleton Demon King’s head to pieces. 
He extracted the core of its magic power and crushed it into dust. 
She couldn’t allow a third party to know about this incident. 
“Alice, come here,” Lin Tian called out. 
Immediately, Alice moved over and took Lin Tian’s hand, no longer daring to let her guard down around Scarlett. 
This ability was pure trickery—almost impossible to counter. 
The only way to expose her was to force her to reveal herself. 
Even though she would revert to her true form after “fun,” the real danger lay in being killed by her soul-stealing skill during the act. 
Scarlett continued, “I have no desire to keep tangling with you. Tell me how you knew about my power, and I’ll let you go. After all, I’m not interested in that desolate place you come from.” 
“Big sis, I’ve already told you everything I know. What else can I do if you don’t understand?” Lin Tian responded helplessly. 
A hint of murderous intent flashed in Scarlett’s eyes. “Hmph, then I’ll just have to kill you. But don’t worry—I won’t kill you outright. I’ll enslave you first! Then, you’ll tell me everything with your own mouth… and you’ll regret it! Hahaha~” 
With that, a mist formed, and she vanished into it. 
Lin Tian and Alice turned and headed in the opposite direction. 
Finally, they reached the outskirts of the Zerg Empire. 
“Though her power is really troublesome, at least it’s all over,” Alice said with relief. 
That situation had been pretty uncomfortable. 
She had known she was the real Alice, but couldn’t prove it. 
Yet, when she looked over at Lin Tian, she saw his face clouded with concern. “Is it over? I don’t think so.” 
“Huh?” Alice was puzzled. “Next time we meet her, we’ll just attack first. What’s there to worry about?” 
“The next time we meet her, she won’t appear as herself. She’ll disguise herself as someone else.” Lin Tian sighed. 
That meant he’d have to hold back and resist certain temptations in the future. 
Otherwise, he could easily fall into her trap. 
He couldn’t afford to let his guard down, not even around his own allies. 
This meant no more… ‘fun’ with beautiful ladies—not even with his own people. 
He might as well become a monk. 
After all, he was a goblin! 
“Big Sis Demon King, I was wrong, okay? Please, don’t do this to me! There’s nothing I’m afraid of—except for this! I admit I’ve lost, completely and utterly!”  
Lin Tian spoke with a tone full of helplessness, almost on the verge of tears.  
With a thud, he dropped to one knee. 
He had lost—truly lost this time. 
After outwitting others so many times, this time he had been outwitted! 
Becoming a monk would be worse than death! 
Even monks might sneak a taste, but he couldn’t afford to. 
At this moment, Alice hesitantly bit her red lips, stammering, “D-don’t worry… If I stay by your side, you won’t fall for her trap. You just need to… with me…” 
“Thank you…” Lin Tian forced a smile, but deep down, he felt nothing but agony. 
What was the point of only having Alice? He wasn’t human, and he wasn’t some kind of upstanding man. 
He obviously craved more. 
Otherwise, when he transmigrated as a goblin, he would’ve been satisfied with just one. 
“Alice, I’m suffering,” Lin Tian sighed deeply, deciding to rest up in the Zerg Empire for now. 
But Alice’s face couldn’t hide her joy. From her perspective, this meant she could spend more time with Lin Tian in certain ways. 
“Goblin King, why do you look so troubled?”  
Inside the ant queen’s underground palace, the Ant Queen asked, full of concern. 
Lin Tian glanced at her. “Come on, haven’t you been eager for this? I’ll fulfill your wish today!”  
His chances to engage with other people would become fewer and fewer in the future. 
So, he needed to cherish those in front of him. 
Since the Ant Queen was still safe and wouldn’t be mimicked by the Lust Demon King, he could indulge for now. 
Hearing this, the Ant Queen was filled with excitement, “Goblin King, I’m truly honored!!!” 
However, after the act was over, the Ant Queen writhed in pain on the ground, crying out in agony, “It hurts! It hurts! Goblin King, what have you done to me?! Help me!” 
Sizzle!  
The sound of burning rang out—it was a sound Lin Tian knew all too well. 
The result of a holy-type attack on a monster! 
Lin Tian had just finished putting on his clothes when he suddenly realized, “How did I forget this?! Lust Demon King, you want to mess with me? Fine! I’ll make sure you suffer the consequences of never being able to enjoy yourself again!” 
Since he now possessed holy power, he could infuse others with divine energy, which was lethal to monsters. 
Luckily, he had tested it on Alice before.  
She was human, so it didn’t harm her. 
“This fusion ability really surprised me… So, I don’t need to hold back. I should take the initiative whenever I see someone attractive?”  
Lin Tian pulled out a bottle of super recovery potion, pouring it to heal the Ant Queen’s injuries. 
As long as he wasn’t engaging with someone for pleasure but treating it as a skill attack,  
he wouldn’t fall prey to the Lust Demon King’s soul-stealing technique.
