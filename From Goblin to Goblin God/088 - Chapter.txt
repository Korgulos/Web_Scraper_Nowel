Chapter 88: Opening the Magic Tool Vault, Three Magic Tools! 
TL: Sungmin  
Over the past few days, Lin Tian had been persistently coaxing, day and night, tirelessly working. 
He finally managed to get the key to the kingdom’s magic tool vault from Adele. 
Though the dwarves hadn’t crafted any new magic tools for decades, there should still be some stock left. 
At the very back of the grand palace, a golden door came into view. 
A hammer was carved in the center of the golden door. 
This was the magic tool vault. 
Upon reaching the door, Lin Tian inserted the key and, as Adele had instructed, turned it two and a half times to the left, and then another two and a half times. 
Then he sang a dwarven folk rap and performed an ancient dance. 
A golden eye on the door opened, scanned Lin Tian’s secret command, and finally opened slowly. 
“Boom, boom, boom…” 
Lin Tian’s heart raced with excitement. Magic tools, extremely rare items. 
Once he obtained them, his strength could change dramatically. 
However. 
The scene before him was completely different from what he had imagined; there was no blinding golden light. 
The inside was empty, covered in cobwebs and dust. 
Rows of massive tool racks held nothing. 
Lin Tian cursed in frustration, feeling happy for nothing. 
It seemed that this damned lazy kingdom had done nothing for years, living off their past achievements, selling off all the magic tools. 
No wonder they lived such comfortable lives. 
But at the very end, Lin Tian still found three magic tools. 
[Life Armor: A living armor that feeds on the host’s blood, possessing strong defense and a protective instinct. It can autonomously detect and defend against enemy attacks.] 
[Ominous Blade: Crafted from the spine of a magic dragon. The deeper the user’s obsession, the more powerful and terrifying the strength it can unleash.] 
[Eye of the Darkspawn: Created from an unknown creature’s remains by dwarves with their miraculous forging skills. It can see through all things, but be cautious of being controlled by it.] 
Lin Tian gently caressed these three magic tools. 
They all responded. 
They didn’t seem to be dead objects but rather three living beings. 
“Is this the power of the dwarves? It feels more like creating life than forging weapons!” 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but marvel at such magic tools. 
The Feitu Magic Ring on his hand couldn’t compare at all, as it was merely crafted by the Ghoul Tribe. 
He immediately put on the Life Armor. 
It looked like a black, shapeless mass. 
No matter how much he fiddled with it, he couldn’t figure out how to wear it. 
Suddenly, Lin Tian thought of something, “If it feeds on the host’s blood…” 
He cut his finger and dripped a drop of blood on it. 
Sure enough, the black mass began to turn into fluid, crawling up his body from the bleeding finger. 
It covered his entire arm, then his whole body! 
Lin Tian’s vision was obscured, he couldn’t see anything, feeling tightly wrapped all over. 
A suffocating sensation, like being entwined by a python, overwhelmed him. 
When the armor adapted to Lin Tian’s body, it slowly shrank into a black crystal-like pendant hanging around his neck. 
Lin Tian felt as though he had established a connection with it. With a thought, the pendant would instantly unfold! 
His entire body would be covered in a layer of crystal-like black armor, and the armor’s style could change freely. 
Full armor, light armor, a flashy, over-the-top edgy armor—anything was possible. 
“Not bad.” 
Lin Tian was fairly satisfied, though he wasn’t sure how high the defense level was. 
Since it was a living being, wearing it didn’t increase the attribute panel’s strength. 
He then picked up the Ominous Blade beside him. 
It was also completely black, exuding a chilling aura of death, somewhat similar to a katana. 
A streak of crimson seemed to flow in the center of the blade. 
It felt like the heart of the weapon. 
The moment he picked it up, Lin Tian felt an overwhelming sense of oppression and couldn’t control the blade. 
“Forget it, I’ll save it for Alice.” 
Lin Tian thought. He didn’t like using melee weapons. Even if his attribute panel was strong, his swordsmanship and combat skills were weak. 
This was an undeniable fact. 
He couldn’t compare to Alicenia and the others. 
As for the last item, the Eye of the Darkspawn, it was set in a golden triangle and had been staring at Lin Tian from the beginning. 
Its scarlet pupil, the entire eyeball filled with bloodshot lines. 
Extremely eerie. 
From its gaze, it seemed to be speaking constantly, but definitely not saying anything good. 
Lin Tian got goosebumps. Though the other two were living beings, they weren’t this creepy. 
Even if it was a world-class magic tool, he didn’t really want it. 
Of course, if he didn’t want it, he could give it to others in the tribe later. 
He packed it up. 
Unfortunately, there were only these three items in the entire magic tool vault. 
Lin Tian thought, “Forget it, I’ll have to make these lazy people restart the Apollo Forge and forge more magic tools for me.” 
These guys weren’t dwarves at all; they were lazybones. 
The Apollo Forge for forging magic tools had been collecting dust in the city for decades. 
Lin Tian planned to have Adele revise the policies. They had to forge at least twenty magic tools daily. 
Lin Tian would stay here for at most two months, and taking back a thousand magic tools would actually be considered few. 
The next day. 
“My dear, I’ve finally found you. Today is my coronation ceremony. Come with me, my beloved queen~” 
Adele’s makeup was elaborate today. 
She wore a crown, white silk gloves, a brand new ceremonial robe, and a stunning hairstyle. 
Every smile and gesture mesmerized the male guards, making them unable to look away. 
Seeing their lustful gazes, Adele sneered, “Don’t you know your size and weight? Stop staring. If I tell you the truth, you’d just feel inferior.” 
She then tightly held Lin Tian’s hand, and the two of them sat in a purely mechanical steam carriage, beginning a city-wide parade. 
After they left, the soldiers’ faces were full of surprise and jealousy. 
They whispered, “Damn, is it true? The guy who’s been causing such a stir in the city recently?” 
“No wonder the queen, no, the empress, is so infatuated. I can’t imagine that kind of size!” 
“Why the hell is he so much more impressive than me? We’re both dwarves!” 
“I wish I could cut it off him and attach it to myself. I wouldn’t even need to work; all the beauties would come to me.” 
From a distance, Adele probably couldn’t hear them. 
But Lin Tian, with his keen hearing skills, could, and he couldn’t help but puff out his chest. 
The racial advantage was really something. 
However, the current situation was a bit awkward. 
A coronation should be just that. Why a city-wide parade? 
Wasn’t that only for criminals? 
After leaving the palace gates, the streets were lined with dwarves, and the windows of the houses were packed with them. 
They all held flowers, congratulating the new king on his ascension. 
Because for three days, all alcohol consumption in the city would be on the royal family’s tab; of course, they were happy. 
“Oh my, ten years ago, I thought the queen was a budding beauty, but today, she looks like a fully bloomed flower!” 
“Tsk, tsk, tsk, she’s more beautiful than fine wine!” 
“Long live the queen! I’d rather drink your nectar than wine for a lifetime!” 
Countless male dwarves shouted, unabashedly expressing their love for Adele. 
Meanwhile. 
The female dwarves all fixed their gazes on Lin Tian. 
Their eyes turned into heart shapes, “Is what the queen’s sister said true? Is that handsome guy really the most manly man in the city?!” 
“He broke the record in dwarf history. I wish I could shape myself into his form!” 
“I’m fed up with my useless man at home. Lord Dennis! Please have mercy on me!” 
“Oh no, I really want to shape myself into his form!” 
The female dwarves acted like crazed fans, not caring about anyone else, even their families. 
Ever since Lin Tian and Adele’s sister separated, she had been searching everywhere, spreading the word about Lin Tian’s size due to his lack of distinctive features. 
This news caused an uproar. 
The information was explosive; it was a record in dwarf history, something unimaginable. 
Everyone would care a bit. 
When the men looked at Lin Tian, their faces were dark, expressing their jealousy vividly. 
Suddenly! 
A female dwarf ignored the obstacles and ran into the street, stopping the queen’s industrial carriage. 
“Dennis! You two-timer, didn’t you say you only loved me? How dare you lie to me!” 
The intruder was Little Mei. 
She stood there, looking righteous. 
Adele frowned slightly, “My dear, who is she?” 
Lin Tian gave a wicked smile, ready to have some fun, “Her? Just a bootlicker, not worthy of being compared to you, my dear.” 
Adele naturally believed him. After all, what female dwarf wouldn’t love Lin Tian? 
From those just understanding love to those who hadn’t reached menopause. 
They would all be madly in love with Lin Tian. 
Mainly because Adele and her sister had experienced the Goblin’s God’s Blessing ability. 
That’s why. 
“A bootlicker? I wonder who’s the real bootlicker. Do you remember how you used to be? You didn’t dare speak against me. If you want my forgiveness, get over here quickly!” 
Little Mei acted arrogant, thinking she could still control the situation. 
The entire city fell silent. 
Lin Tian didn’t say a word, looking at her like she was an idiot. 
The awkward atmosphere spread. 
Little Mei felt so humiliated that she almost cried, “Why is it like this? You were chasing me before, why didn’t you tell me how amazing you were earlier!” 
Defeating the ghouls was the highest honor in the Dwarf Kingdom in decades! 
And suddenly, inexplicably being called the manliest man in dwarf history. 
How could she not be moved? 
Her family had scolded her for not seizing the opportunity, letting such a good catch slip away. 
“Where did this girl come from, is her brain damaged?” 
“Heh, doesn’t she know her worth? Even I couldn’t get him, and she thinks he would chase her?” 
“Has her skin gotten that thick? What a disgrace.” 
The female dwarves around started to attack her. 
They felt insulted by Little Mei’s actions. 
However, Lin Tian then spoke, “Little Mei, it’s not impossible for me to forgive you. Kneel down, roll your eyes, make an ahegao face, and loudly say to everyone: Master Dennis, please shape me into your form!” 
Hiss! 
In an instant. 
The whole city was in an uproar! 
Everyone showed expectant expressions, their faces full of mischievous smiles.
