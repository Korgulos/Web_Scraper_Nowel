Chapter 153: These Two Guys Are No Good 
“That person… gives me a very strange feeling…” 
Watching Lin Tian walk away, a trace of confusion appeared on Joan of Arc’s pure, fair face. 
She felt something was off but couldn’t quite put her finger on it. 
Alexander, having regained his composure, said, “Get this mess cleaned up immediately. Your Majesty, Joan of Arc, please come with me. Everyone is already waiting for you.” 
“My apologies…” 
Joan of Arc offered an apologetic smile. 
She followed him to the War Hall to attend the Demon King Subjugation Council. 
Since they had killed Fischer and used the materials obtained to create various magical artifacts, they had developed a taste for it. 
Now, they planned to continue subjugating other Demon Kings. 
The loot from these battles would not only solidify their empire’s position but could even allow them to catch up with those semi-divine nations. 
However, to subdue a Demon King-level boss, the involvement of Joan of Arc, who possessed semi-divine blood, was necessary. 
This was the only way they stood a chance. 
It was also the only way they could maintain ties with a semi-divine bloodline ruler. 
… 
On the way back. 
Lin Tian, supporting the weak Grugia, couldn’t help but ask, “Brothers, who was that Joan of Arc just now? What’s her background?” 
“Huh? You don’t know about Saint Joan of Arc? She’s an incredibly great person.” 
Osius, also helping to support Grugia, replied in surprise. 
In this continent, who hadn’t heard of Joan of Arc? 
Someone began explaining, “Legend has it that she’s the child of the main god Athena, born on earth; otherwise, there’s no way she could have achieved so much.” 
“She led an army of three thousand slaves and gradually dismantled the Solon Empire, which had a million elite soldiers. Truly a miracle of war.” 
“So young, with an unprecedented level of awareness, she established a nation of freedom and equality, without a single noble or clan.” 
“Nineteen years old! When I was nineteen, I was still practicing slow hand movements, while she was already leading troops and founding an empire. How shameful!” 
Everyone sighed, full of admiration for her. 
Osius added, “Kid, it was thanks to your quick thinking earlier that Joan of Arc took pity on us. By the way, did you see who unleashed that powerful lightning attack?” 
At these words, everyone pricked up their ears. 
Thinking back, without that lightning attack, they might all have been dead. 
Lin Tian quickly shook his head, “Did it? I didn’t see any lightning earlier.” 
No matter what, he was still a goblin and could never truly integrate into human society. 
Once the One-Eyed Owl’s wounds healed, and he learned her combat techniques, it would be time to leave this place. 
Developing his Goblin Empire was the most important thing. 
… 
Time passed quickly, and two days later. 
The One-Eyed Owl was still lying in bed, her breathing weak. 
Her injuries were too severe. 
Lin Tian felt somewhat guilty, “Still not better with the super healing potion?” 
“That stuff is very difficult to concoct. Several alchemists haven’t slept, and Osius is also helping. It requires more than three hundred ingredients and nineteen refining processes just to make one bottle.” Grugia said heavily. 
His injuries were just ordinary external wounds, and he had recovered quickly. He was fine now. 
Lin Tian also furrowed his brow. It wasn’t just sympathy for the One-Eyed Owl; staying here wasn’t getting him anywhere. 
On the sickbed. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s delicate, valiant face was quietly resting, her eyes closed. 
A few strands of hair partially covered her face. 
Her body was wrapped in bandages. 
Since arriving here, this might have been the most peaceful she had ever been. 
“They’re here! Move aside, quickly!” 
At this moment, Osius’s hurried voice came from outside the door. 
He rushed in, holding an alchemical cauldron, not caring about the heat. 
Seeing this, everyone quickly stepped back. 
Grugia frowned, “So fast?” 
“Skipping the preservation and bottling steps speeds things up a lot. Give me a hand and pour the potion over her wounds.” 
Osius, panting heavily, explained. 
In the cauldron, which was over three meters wide, a faint red glow shimmered. 
The entire room was filled with the scent of the potion. 
Lin Tian and Grugia began unwrapping the bandages on the One-Eyed Owl, revealing her wounds. 
They lifted the alchemical cauldron together and started pouring the potion onto the wounds. 
They mainly focused on the injured areas: her arms, ankles, waist, and so on. 
“What’s going on? There’s only that little bit?” 
Lin Tian remarked, expecting there to be much more. 
But it was less than a mouthful of water. 
Osius snapped, “What do you know? This is already the amount of ten super recovery potions.” 
Immediately, the One-Eyed Owl’s entire body began to glow with a red starlight. 
The once blurry fists began to regenerate muscle and bone! 
In an instant, she looked almost as good as new, perhaps even more delicate! 
In no time, it was as if she had been restored to her original state. 
However, the potion had no effect on consciousness. 
They believed she would wake up soon. 
Everyone kept vigil by the bedside, their eyes fixed intently on her. 
Gradually. 
That beautiful eye slowly opened, curiously taking in the surroundings. 
“Whoosh!” 
Suddenly, the One-Eyed Owl sprang up like a zombie, her demeanor cautious. “You bastards, showing your true colors now? Planning to take advantage of me while I was unconscious?!” 
“Today, I’ll beat all of you until you can’t stand again!!!” As she spoke, the One-Eyed Owl prepared to strike, raising her fist. 
Grugia quickly retreated in fear, “Hey, hey, why are you hitting me first? Big Sis, you’ve misunderstood! We just used a super recovery potion on you and were waiting for you to wake up!” 
“Yeah, we wouldn’t dare make a move on you even if we had ten times the courage.” 
“Innocent, we swear…” 
Upon hearing this. 
The One-Eyed Owl looked at her fully restored limbs and finally believed them. “Where are those bugs?! I need to go finish them off!” 
“Big Sis, things aren’t as you think. You were framed by the Landau family.” Osius quickly explained. 
Then, he looked toward Lin Tian. 
Lin Tian recounted the entire situation, including how they had gone to Twilight City to wipe out the Landau family. 
However, he left out the part about his fight with the Ironhorn Chieftain. 
The One-Eyed Owl patted Lin Tian, “I see. Thanks for that; I was almost taken out back then. That feeling, hahaha! It was exhilarating!!!” 
“Huh?” This left Lin Tian somewhat confused. He asked in bewilderment, “What do you mean?” 
“Didn’t expect you to have another trick up your sleeve. I almost thought I was going to be killed.” The One-Eyed Owl said as she rubbed her growling stomach. “Where’s the food? I’m starving! Go get me something to eat!” 
“Oh! Right away!” The group dispersed in a hurry. 
Lin Tian, however, felt something was off, “You were…” 
“I was still conscious back then, just a bit muddled.” The One-Eyed Owl said, but she acted as if it was no big deal, quickly tidying up to head to the guild hall. 
She left behind a deeply conflicted Lin Tian. 
Damn, I didn’t expect to be exposed like this. I underestimated this woman’s resilience, thinking she was completely out cold. 
He quickly called out to her, “Big Sis, so you…” 
The One-Eyed Owl glanced back at him, “So what? Don’t worry. In the Dragon Slayer Guild, we don’t care if you’re a demon or a monster. As long as you’re accepted, you can join. Some members even have demi-human blood running through their veins.” 
“Grugia, that bald guy—strictly speaking, he isn’t human either; he’s a Titan.” 
With that, she casually walked away. 
The table was already filled with delicious dishes. 
But the One-Eyed Owl first headed for the beer barrel, poured herself a large mug, and downed it in one gulp! 
She looked at everyone, “What are you all standing around for? Aren’t we going to celebrate my resurrection?” 
“Oh, right, right! Everyone, drink to your heart’s content!” Grugia, stunned for a moment, excitedly brought out a large number of cups. 
Osius ran outside again, instructing the restaurant owner to bring in more dishes. 
The group split into several tables, holding their beer, ready to start eating. 
Grugia looked around, “Hmm? Where’s that rookie? Such a noob, not even eager for food.” 
He said, getting up to look for Lin Tian. 
The One-Eyed Owl, however, said, “You all eat. I’ll go get him.” 
She headed to the guild square but didn’t go toward the dormitory area. Instead, she leapt onto the rooftops. 
With a few quick steps, she darted through the sprawling buildings. 
She arrived at the city wall. 
She shouted coldly, “Hey! Where do you think you’re going, kid? I just came back to life and am celebrating. You’re ignoring that? Want to die?” 
“Crack, crack…” 
Her fists clenched, making a crackling sound. 
Lin Tian paused slightly, stopping in his tracks. 
His identity was already exposed, and even though the One-Eyed Owl had said what she did earlier, he still intended to leave. 
He thought of this outing as an opportunity to gather information about the War Empire. 
And also about Saint Joan of Arc. 
“Big Sis, I’m different from you all. If you knew my true identity… I think we’ll meet again on the battlefield in the future.” 
Lin Tian said, his eyes filled with a heavy burden. 
Though they were labeled as lunatics by humans, they were still human in the end. 
Their values and worldviews were different. 
And when ideologies clash, conflict is inevitable. 
However, the One-Eyed Owl burst into wild laughter, “Ha ha ha! You brat, who are you talking to? Meet me on the battlefield? Pfft!” 
“You think I’m weak? If you’d told me earlier that you could fend for yourself, I would’ve flattened that bug tribe long ago!” 
“I don’t care who you are or what your identity is, but for now, you’re still a member of the Dragon Slayer Guild. So come back and have a drink with me! Tonight, I’m going to drink you under the table!” 
Then, with a slightly more serious expression, she added, “If you really want to leave, I won’t stop you. But remember, you can always return to this city…” 
Hearing this. 
Lin Tian wavered. Perhaps this was the only place in human territory where he could appear legally. 
If that’s the case. 
What was he waiting for? 
“Hmph, do you think I really want to leave? You haven’t even taught me the breathing technique yet, Big Sis!” Lin Tian’s lips curled into a slight smile as he spoke. 
At the same time, the One-Eyed Owl grinned back, “Hahaha! Fine, drink me under the table, and I’ll teach you! Think you’ve got what it takes?” 
Back at the guild hall. 
Grugia quickly made room for him, “Rookie, you finally showed up. I ordered a special dish just for you—you deserve some thanks!” 
“Yeah, yeah, come and try it!” Osius added, standing up with a big grin. 
They were being extremely hospitable. 
Lin Tian didn’t hold back; it felt just like before. “Oh? What kind of dish?” 
“This dish is called ‘Hero’s Might!’ Legend has it that those who eat this dish will become unparalleled heroes! Whenever a man’s spirit is at its lowest, he’ll eat this dish.  
After eating it, he’ll regain his confidence, become like a war god! A great hero! Conquering those powerful foes that were once unbeatable!” Grugia explained enthusiastically. 
Osius quickly brought the entire plate over to Lin Tian. 
Seeing the steaming dish, which looked like some kind of stew, Lin Tian didn’t find it strange. 
The appearance certainly couldn’t compare to what he had eaten in his previous life. 
But hearing such grand claims about it, he felt compelled to try it. 
It couldn’t be that bad, considering he had saved these guys and this was their way of repaying him. 
Little did he know. 
He hadn’t noticed the mischievous grins Grugia and Osius were trying to suppress, their eyes glancing slyly at one another.
