Chapter 3: Female Goblin!! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Kehehe.” 
Upon emerging, the Goblin Priest gave a sinister smile, its hollow, crimson eyes glaring at Lin Tian. 
Then it turned to leave. 
Taking this as approval, the small leader prepared to start a fire, ruthlessly stomping on Lin Tian a few more times. 
As if treating him like an object. 
They were going to roast him alive! 
This was the harsh reality: death was always imminent. Who would still dream of transmigrating? Better to wash up and go to sleep. 
Of course, Lin Tian had expected this. After all, he had transmigrated into a goblin and had access to its memories. 
He quickly spoke, “I can make weapons! Please let me join you!” 
When speaking to these goblins, it was best to keep the language simple and stiff, otherwise, they wouldn’t understand. 
Hearing this, the Goblin Priest halted its steps. 
It walked back to Lin Tian in a very bizarre manner, using its long, blackhead-covered nose to sniff him repeatedly. 
Then it said, “No scent of lies. Release him. What kind of weapons can you make?” 
The higher the rank of the goblin, the more intelligent it became, and its speech patterns were closer to humans. 
“Simple iron tools are no problem. That way, when we encounter monsters or humans, we can win.” 
Lin Tian stood up, his gaze resolute. 
He had casually watched a few episodes of “Alone in the Wild,” which included iron forging. He basically understood the process. 
Upon hearing this, the other goblins’ eyes sparkled with shock! 
Iron tools! 
Of course, they knew what those were—the tools humans used to slaughter them! 
When they encountered those, they would bleed, sometimes losing limbs. 
“Great! We can kill humans and never run out of meat!” 
“If we have ironware, can we attack the elf tribe to the north?” 
“I prefer elves over humans, kehehe!” 
The Goblin Priest was also astonished, letting out an evil, sharp laugh, “Kehehe! Then hurry and make them!” 
“I’m very tired. I’ll do it tomorrow.” 
Having run for half the night, Lin Tian was already exhausted, gasping for breath. Searching for iron ore and forging iron would be too much. 
Mainly, this body was too weak. 
Immediately, the goblins began to get displeased, becoming irritable, feeling deceived. 
The small leader even pressed a stone spear against Lin Tian’s stomach, ready to disembowel him with a bit more force. 
The Goblin Priest also looked slightly ferocious, “If you can’t make ironware, you won’t get any food!” 
With that, it returned to the shack. 
That old creature was extremely cautious, never participating in battles. In its youth, it only focused on breeding and wouldn’t come out unless necessary. 
Lin Tian had no right to make demands now. He could only find a haystack to rest, calm down, and think. 
To seek revenge, he couldn’t rely solely on his own strength. 
This goblin tribe could be useful. 
But he had to kill that small goblin leader who dared to step on his face first!! 
And from the conversation earlier, there was an elf tribe to the north. If he could mate with the elves, his power would greatly increase. 
Thinking about this, he gradually fell asleep. 
… 
“Wake up, wake up…” 
In the midst of his sleep, Lin Tian was awakened by a gentle voice. 
Opening his eyes, he saw a goblin wrapped in a tattered cloth robe sitting beside him, the hood almost covering its face. 
It was smaller than a regular goblin. 
Seeing Lin Tian awake, it tightened the robe, as if afraid of being seen. 
“Are you hungry? Here, take this.” 
The small goblin handed him a lump of something black and grimy, trembling slightly. 
It was clearly the skin of some creature, still with bloodstains on the fur. Disgusting to the extreme. 
A pile of dung would look more appealing. 
Seeing Lin Tian unmoved, the small goblin seemed disappointed. “This is all I got, but it’s delicious. Try it.” 
Hearing this, Lin Tian looked not far away and saw that the goblins had caught a wild boar and were sharing the meat. 
So, this piece of boar skin was all this small goblin had to eat today. 
It might not have eaten for several days. 
Lin Tian felt touched but suddenly grew cautious, “Wait, why are you giving this to me?” 
Under normal circumstances, such a low-level goblin would not help others when it couldn’t even feed itself. 
Too unusual! 
“I… I don’t know…” 
The small goblin seemed confused by the question, feeling as if it had made a mistake. 
Lin Tian didn’t think too much about it and checked its attribute panel.

(Note: Not the heroine, just a convenient tool) 
“What!!” 
Seeing these titles, Lin Tian couldn’t help but exclaim in shock! 
What were these?! 
It was known that goblins didn’t have females! Yet a legendary female goblin had appeared! 
In human legends, a male goblin could become a Goblin God by mating with a female goblin! 
Of course, this was just a mockery since goblins would never give birth to females. 
To reproduce, they had to mate with other creatures. 
Hearing his shout, the goblins who were devouring raw meat and drinking blood only glanced at him and then looked away. 
They perfectly embodied the saying “minding one’s own business.” 
Lin Tian gradually recovered from his shock. No wonder this little guy was so intelligent. 
Seeing his reaction, the small goblin was frightened and sat on the ground, “I-I-I meant no harm, I just wanted to give you some food, sob sob…” 
“Cough cough, sorry for scaring you. Thank you for the food. Let’s eat together.” 
Lin Tian quickly apologized, realizing he didn’t need to speak so simplistically with her. 
He then tore the boar skin in half, stuffing one part into her mouth and swallowing the other himself. 
Though it tasted terrible, it undoubtedly helped restore his strength. 
The small goblin ate slowly, savoring it as if it were a gourmet meal. 
Lin Tian wiped his mouth and extended his hand, “From now on, I’ll be your boss, and I’ll look after you.” 
“Boss?” 
The small goblin was stunned. In this tribe, she was ostracized not just because of her weakness but also because she couldn’t communicate with other goblins. 
Like a normal person trying to fit in with a group of idiots. 
So the newly arrived Lin Tian piqued her curiosity, prompting her to try and communicate. 
“Okay, boss! I love watching the moon, so call me Gobu Yue. What’s your name?” 
The small goblin said excitedly. 
She even gave herself a name? 
Goblins didn’t have names unless they were high-ranking. After thinking for a moment, Lin Tian said, “My name will be Goblin.” 
His surname was Lin, so he simply chose Goblin. 
Gobu Yue nodded vigorously. 
It was about time Lin Tian got down to business. He and Gobu Yue climbed a large tree next to the tribe, surveying the surroundings. 
The area was dense with forests, a few kilometers from the valley. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but ask, “Gobu Yue, have you seen any black and yellow stones covered in dust and very hard?” 
“Um, sorry boss, I haven’t seen any.” 
Gobu Yue thought for a while and replied, looking somewhat disappointed. 
Lin Tian could only nod. This weak goblin had probably never left the tribe and wouldn’t know about iron ore. 
The valley likely had some, but crossing the magic-infested forest was too dangerous. 
He could only use the Life Simulation System. 
“System, start Life Simulation.” 
[Life Simulation System is starting. Current scenario: Integrating into a new tribe. 
You shamelessly took on a small goblin follower, forming a close bond and finally feeling a bit of warmth. 
But due to the pressure from the Goblin Priest, you had to risk searching for iron ore in the valley. 
On the way, you encountered a fleeing herd of deer. It turned out to be a pack of Tier 2 Shadow Wolves. Gobu Yue died protecting you from the wolves. 
After much hardship, you finally reached the valley. There was indeed iron ore, but it was occupied by elves. 
(Option 1: Leave to be safe, return in disgrace, score -5 points) 
(Option 2: Take a chance and try to secretly mine some iron ore, otherwise, you won’t be able to explain to the Goblin Priest, score 15) 
(Option 3: Search another place, score unchanged)] 
Since it was a life simulation, dying wouldn’t matter. Lin Tian chose the second option, especially since Gobu Yue had died. Such a valuable goblin shouldn’t be wasted. 
So he would try any risky option. 
[The sharp-eyed elves discovered you. You were shot in the shoulder by an arrow and died from infection a few days after returning. 
The other goblins feasted on your corpse. 
Summary: Your weakness led to this outcome, causing the death of your follower and yourself. 
Score: 15 points (out of 100) 
Reward: 15 Life Points 
Life Simulation complete. Time elapsed: 7 days.] 
“Boss? Why are you not talking?” 
Gobu Yue’s curious voice pulled Lin Tian back from the system. 
He replied, “Just lost in thought. Let’s go back.” 
Since iron ore was found in the valley, he could only rely on the system for now. 
Lin Tian checked the function of Life Points. 
As expected, transmigrator systems were quite similar. Life Points could be exchanged for various items. 
The lowest level included ironware. One Life Point could be exchanged for an iron sword, iron armor, or a potion. 
With 15 Life Points, he could get several iron tools. 
That was the plan. 
First, he would appease the Goblin Priest, then suggest sending other goblins to search for iron ore. 
Gradually establishing his authority, he would take over the tribe. 
This was the first step towards avenging himself on humans, the bearded man, and the nun in white robes!
