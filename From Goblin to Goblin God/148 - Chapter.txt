Chapter 148: Exposed Identity, One-Eyed Owl Near Death! 
TL: Sungmin 
Lin Tian hurriedly shouted from behind, “Big Sis! That’s enough, your hands can’t hold out much longer!” 
It wasn’t just that her hands were about to be ruined. 
If her hands were crippled, she wouldn’t be able to fight back and would be beaten down. 
Lin Tian wasn’t confident enough to think he could defeat a tank-like high-defense, high-attack chief of the Ironhorn Tribe! 
However, the One-Eyed Owl showed no signs of stopping. 
Laughing madly, she said, “I’m really on a high right now! I can’t stop! Hahaha!!!” 
Each punch sent blood splattering! 
Some belonged to the rhinoceros beetles, some to her. 
The blood splattered on her flushed face, adding a touch of seductive color, her eyes misty and almost dripping with desire! 
At this moment, her state was like that of a woman in the throes of ecstasy! 
She laughed in a delirious, indulgent manner. 
She wanted more! 
One after another, over a hundred rhinoceros beetles were beaten to a pulp! 
Until the One-Eyed Owl’s fists could no longer hold, her flesh and bones shattered and scattered all over the ground. 
She finally stopped. 
Dragging her arms, which could neither be lifted nor controlled, she retreated to Lin Tian’s side. 
She sighed, “So tough! So satisfying! I’ve never fought prey like this before!” 
“Big Sis, are you really crazy? Let’s retreat first!” 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but speak, incredulous at her recklessness. 
However, the One-Eyed Owl calmly replied, “Retreat? No way, I’m not leaving. Continue!!” 
She planned to single-handedly hold off the remaining hundred or so rhinoceros beetles. 
Lin Tian’s expression changed slightly, “What are you going to use to block them? You can’t stop them anymore. Isn’t it better to call the guild and flatten this place?” 
“Kid, are you kidding me? My legs are still fine!” 
The One-Eyed Owl said spiritedly and charged towards the rhinoceros beetles! 
“Her hands are crippled! Let’s attack! Kill her!” 
“Damn human!!!” 
“I’ll suck your brain! Your fluids!” 
For a moment, these rhinoceros beetles thought they could finally kill the One-Eyed Owl. 
But she unexpectedly delivered a high kick! 
She brutally shattered the skull of the foremost rhinoceros beetle, its brain splattered! 
Its two eyes popped out like peas, its face grotesquely disfigured. 
It died on the spot. 
The One-Eyed Owl continued, if she couldn’t use her fists, then she’d use her legs! 
Her leg skills were even more formidable than her punches. 
She could suppress such a large group of iron-hard rhinoceros beetles! 
At that moment, Lin Tian finally understood the difference between himself and these people. 
He sought stability, aiming to grow strong and laugh last. 
But these people didn’t care who survived in the end; as long as they lived, they wanted to enjoy what they loved to the fullest! 
Until death! 
Although it didn’t concern him much, it pained him to see this. This couldn’t go on; they had to leave and seek help. 
Because the Dragon Slayer Guild’s hunting missions were usually completed solo. 
Just like this time, especially since the One-Eyed Owl herself was involved. 
No one else had thought to come along. 
However, 
The journey back and forth would take nearly two hours. 
Could she hold out? 
“Why are you still standing there, you rookie! If it weren’t for you holding me back, I could have used a different fighting style! Get lost! Do I have to spell it out for you!” Finally, the One-Eyed Owl spoke up. 
Kicking the rhinoceros beetles as if they were footballs. 
Although these rhinoceros beetles were almost dead, only a few still alive. 
But the strongest Ironhorn Chief hadn’t made a move yet. 
Moreover, the One-Eyed Owl’s legs were also mangled, especially the left one, which had been used too many times. 
Some bones were already shattered. 
Because of her sense of responsibility, she couldn’t retreat. Since she had brought this ‘rookie’ Lin Tian, she had to ensure his safe return. 
She just wasn’t good with words and didn’t say it. 
Suddenly. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s pupils contracted, sensing an approaching threat! 
But it was too late to dodge. 
The Ironhorn Chief charged in a sneak attack, its sharp horn fiercely striking her from the side! 
“Crack!” 
Three ribs broke! 
And pierced her lungs and liver! 
Floating in mid-air, the One-Eyed Owl couldn’t find a leverage point to break free. 
She could only be pushed forward rapidly by the long, hard horn. 
All obstacles in their path collided into the One-Eyed Owl. 
“Boom!” 
A meter-thick oak tree was snapped by the One-Eyed Owl being pushed into it. 
Then another two, three trees! 
The hard granite was shattered into pieces! 
Whether it was huge rocks or trees, the One-Eyed Owl swept through them like a bulldozer’s blade, clearing everything in her path. 
A wide road, over a thousand meters long, was cleared! 
It was a shocking sight! 
“This dumb kid… already scared stupid… not leaving… so damn foolish…” 
The One-Eyed Owl, with her remaining eye, watched Lin Tian from afar. 
Her vision was blurred, her head swaying with no strength left to support it. 
Even cursing Lin Tian was a struggle, her words slurred and unclear. 
Gradually. 
She closed her eyes. 
Seeing the unconscious One-Eyed Owl, the Ironhorn Chief’s face was full of pride. “Hmph, female human, no matter how strong you are, you have limits. Accept the wrath of the Ironhorn Tribe!” 
She wasn’t foolish; when her fists were crippled, she could have easily escaped. 
But given Lin Tian’s displayed strength, escape was impossible. 
So she chose to fight to the death. 
“Although usually unapproachable and self-serving, I didn’t expect you to have such a strong sense of responsibility.” 
Lin Tian’s voice slowly rose. 
He had approached the Ironhorn Chief from behind. 
Seeing the dying One-Eyed Owl, he was quite moved. 
The Ironhorn Chief turned around. Although only two or three meters tall, every movement made him seem like a mountain shifting! 
The ground rumbled. 
He looked at Lin Tian with disdain, “A weaker human? You don’t seem to be as strong as a single hair of that female!” 
“Indeed, I’m not as strong as her, but if I decided to kill you… you might not survive!!!” 
“Whoosh!!!” 
Lin Tian reverted to his original, fearsome goblin form! 
A terrifying demonic aura surged into the sky! 
It stirred the entire forest! 
The Ironhorn Chief’s expression changed dramatically. He stepped back several paces, exclaiming, “You’re a demon! And such a powerful one!” 
Such a terrifying demonic aura was unprecedented! 
It only appeared on extremely evil and brutal demons. 
But upon closer inspection. 
He couldn’t help but laugh, “A goblin? You really scared me there. I thought you were some formidable demon, but you’re just trash…” 
“Buzz!!!” 
Suddenly, his ears burst, blood splattering. 
His mind went blank. 
Lin Tian had used his Ruinous Howl, then immediately drew out the Spear of Zeus. 
He thrust it fiercely into the Ironhorn Chief’s mouth. 
“Sizzle!” 
Powerful lightning surged in! It also summoned a massive thunderbolt, splitting the earth! 
He hadn’t intended to use the Spear of Zeus to kill this guy, and it certainly couldn’t penetrate. 
So, elemental attacks were bound to be effective. 
Sure enough, 
After waking up, the Ironhorn Chief lay on the ground, emitting the smell of roasted insects. 
But he quickly stood up, slightly surprised, “You don’t seem to be an ordinary goblin? You can actually summon lightning!” 
Though slightly injured, he was mostly unharmed. 
He began to attack. 
Each claw swipe could easily topple a meter-thick tree! 
The force was terrifying. 
Lin Tian dodged swiftly, a sinister smile on his lips. 
After some time, he activated his latest skill, Anubis’ Soul Drain! 
He landed another ten-second strong control. 
This time, he aimed at the gaps in the Ironhorn Chief’s carapace! 
He drew out the Spear of Zeus and stabbed it in fiercely! 
“Splurt!” 
It pierced accurately, fluid spurting! 
Earlier, Lin Tian had used the Blood of Ruin, which, although it mainly countered holy attributes, weakened the opponent’s physical strength as well. 
It just needed some time. 
He had spent some time wearing him down. 
Sure enough, now his attacks could pierce the opponent’s body, albeit not deeply. 
But it was enough. 
He summoned the lightning! 
Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside! 
The Ironhorn Chief woke up with a jolt, “Impossible! My defense is broken?! What kind of weapon is that!” 
After the electric shock, his movements were sluggish, muscles paralyzed, organs failing. 
Continuing to fight, the outcome was uncertain. 
“Right, let’s see what I can steal from you.” Lin Tian’s lips curled into a smile. 
He activated Lucky Steal again. 
This guy had nothing on him, no equipment, so what he stole was probably useless. 
‘Congratulations, you’ve obtained the Ironhorn Chief’s wife!’ Lin Tian was dumbfounded, holding a heavy black object. 
He could barely hold it steady, 
A slightly smaller-than-average rhinoceros beetle. 
And it had a large belly, filled with many eggs. 
It was about to give birth. 
“Wife! What have you done, put my wife down!” 
Seeing this, the Ironhorn Chief was dumbfounded, shouting in anger. 
He charged madly, overflowing with killing intent! 
Lin Tian held the Spear of Zeus to the female rhinoceros beetle’s neck, “Stop, one more step and I’ll kill her on the spot!” 
“Don’t be impulsive, what do you want? I’ll let you go, is that enough?” The Ironhorn Chief, frightened, stopped, not daring to move rashly. 
In their tribe, the male rhinoceros beetles were responsible for fighting. 
Female rhinoceros beetles were like dung beetles, without long horns, and their shells weren’t very hard. 
Their combat strength was very low. 
Lin Tian could easily kill it. 
The Ironhorn Chief, both shocked and enraged, dared not do anything. 
This maneuver. 
Lin Tian was left speechless with shock as well. 
Lucky Steal was ridiculously overpowered! 
Only now did he realize that this skill was ‘conceptual’—he could steal anything that held deep emotional value to the target. 
Even their wife! 
Seeing the female rhinoceros beetle trembling in fear, its big eyes filled with terror, Lin Tian didn’t have the heart to kill it. 
In the past, he would have killed the female rhinoceros beetle first, enraged the Ironhorn Chief, and then looked for an opportunity to counterattack. 
But now he asked, “Earlier, you said humans deserve to be killed and spoke of revenge. What do you mean?” 
“You don’t know? Well, you are a goblin. 
Our Ironhorn Tribe has always endured silently, living in Oakwood Forest of about ten kilometers, never provoking others, advocating peace. 
We even often shared our winter acorns with the children of nearby villages who came to gather fruits. 
But humans, recently, infiltrated our camp and killed our children! How could I not be furious!” 
The Ironhorn Chief spoke, gritting his teeth, his entire body trembling! 
He was shaking with rage. 
Upon hearing this. 
Lin Tian could already confirm his suspicion. 
Someone was targeting the Dragon Slayer Guild, aiming to kill the One-Eyed Owl!
