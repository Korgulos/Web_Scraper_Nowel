Chapter 239: Journey to the Uninhabited Zone! Searching for the Sword Tomb 
TL: Sungmin  
“And what about us? Brother Tian, I want a Sun-Class weapon too!”   
Osius hurriedly exclaimed, his eyes gleaming with excitement. 
Grugia stammered, “If that’s too much to ask, then at least give us a chance at the royal city’s concubine selection. After all, a Sun-Class weapon is too valuable.”   
“Yes, yes, I agree! I’d be satisfied with just the concubine selection opportunity!”   
The other members of the Dragon Slayer Guild eagerly echoed, their eyes filled with anticipation.   
Lin Tian shot them a glance, “I’m serious right now. As for you guys, focus on leveling up first. The magic crystals in the Yeti Valley are there for the taking—eat until you reach level 100, then learn world-class magic. As for the Sun-Class weapons, we’ll see about that later. We don’t even know if we can scrape together a full set yet.”   
“What?! Those magic crystals taste like piss crystals, they’re disgusting!” Osius complained bitterly, his face full of reluctance.   
The One-Eyed Owl glanced coldly at them, “Not eating? Well, then prepare to eat shit. If you die, you won’t even get a chance to enjoy that royal concubine selection.”   
Her words were like pearls of wisdom. 
The Dragon Slayer Guild members acted as if they had been injected with adrenaline, rushing to boost their levels.   
Humans, unlike goblins, couldn’t level up by devouring corpses—they could only rely on killing enemies.   
This was the case for most powerful species.   
However, magic crystals were like experience fruits, effective for any race.   
Once the group left, Lin Tian summoned Lia.   
“Your Majesty, Gobu Yue already informed me—you want to help us increase our combat power, right?”   
Lia sat gracefully in the grand hall, looking troubled. She continued, “I’m an elf. I can’t learn magic, nor am I skilled in close combat. No matter how strong the equipment is, my abilities will be limited. I’m sorry, but I might end up being a burden.”   
Seeing how considerate everyone was, Lin Tian felt quite comforted. He responded, “Do you have any solutions, then?”   
At this point, Lin Tian didn’t have any good ideas.   
After all, he had only unified the wilderness. He hadn’t become an all-powerful god.   
However, Lia had always been sensible and tactful. If she could help improve their strength, she would undoubtedly try.   
If it truly couldn’t be done, he could simply leave her in charge of managing the empire’s internal affairs. 
“My father was once the chief of a small village in the Elven Kingdom, but he angered the elven nobles, which is why we fled to the wilderness. To improve my combat power, I’d need access to the Elven Kingdom’s exclusive magic and equipment. Unfortunately, the kingdom is far from here, and they wouldn’t share their resources with us…” Lia explained, her eyes full of guilt.   
Lin Tian nodded slightly, “I see. The Elven Kingdom, beyond the Uninhabited Zone… I’ll help you when the time comes.”   
For now, he would leave Lia to manage the empire’s internal affairs.   
Elves were meticulous, skilled at handling delicate matters, and thoughtful in their approach.   
They were perfect for overseeing internal administration. 
“Thank you, but are you really going to cross the Uninhabited Zone? Back then, we paid a hefty sum to hire a ship to escape…”  Lia voiced her concern.   
Lin Tian nodded in acknowledgment, “You’re right, but I’m not crazy. I’m not crossing the Uninhabited Zone just for the sake of it. I need to lead an army across, and for that, we need enough strength.”   
The Uninhabited Zone was like the ultimate version of the Enchanted Forest. 
It was the largest magic-infested area on the continent. 
It was possible to bypass it entirely by flying over.   
However, for an army of millions, tens of millions, or even billions, flying over was not an option.   
Clearing a path through it was the only choice.   
It would also serve as a gateway before they launched an assault on a Demigod Empire. If they could crush the Uninhabited Zone, crushing a Demigod Empire would be no big deal. 
“Alright then, I’ll get back to work.” Lia slowly left.   
As she reached the door, she nodded politely, “Princess Alice…”   
Alice had just arrived.   
She smiled and nodded back at Lia.   
Lin Tian’s expression grew complex. Alice was the last person left. Once her combat strength improved, it would be enough.   
As for the dwarves, their strength relied on inventing new battle machinery.   
Ancient dragons had their limitations.   
They could handle large-scale armies, but they couldn’t be counted as top-tier combat power. 
At most, Little Black and Spark could be considered top-tier combatants.   
They just needed time to grow stronger. 
As for Kassandra and Ifreya, there was no need for further strength enhancement. Their healing magic was sufficient.   
As for Veronica, there was even less need to worry. That woman was more eager than anyone to boost her combat strength.   
She had more methods than Lin Tian himself.   
Rebecca’s love was something Lin Tian couldn’t reciprocate, so he left it up to Veronica to win her back on her own.   
The two continued living quietly in the countryside. 
… 
“Messenger…”   
Alice entered the hall and stood upright, hesitating slightly as she spoke.   
She wasn’t sure if she should continue playing her role. 
Lin Tian waved his hand dismissively. “Forget it, just call me Lin Tian. This whole ‘Messenger’ thing, it’s all fake. I’m just a goblin, an evil monster.” 
He was fortunate that Alice had cooperated with him during their act. Otherwise, it would have been truly awkward. 
“Alright then, Your Majesty Lin Tian…” Alice responded with a serious expression. 
Lin Tian glanced at her current attribute panel and combat strength. 
Fifteen thousand points. Quite powerful. She had fully mastered the power of Sylph and could even allow Darkspawn to partially control her. 
With half-control and Sylph combined, her strength could easily reach seventeen thousand. 
If she was under full control, her power would be immeasurable. 
Lin Tian’s brow furrowed deeper. He had no idea how to further increase Alice’s combat power. 
Her equipment was already world-class, and she had Sylph, a powerful elemental spirit. 
As for her combat techniques, they had become top-tier. 
Her swordsmanship had vastly improved since receiving guidance from Darkspawn. 
Her skills, when combined with Sylph’s abilities, allowed her to use one or two world-class spells. 
As he thought about it, Lin Tian’s eyes lit up. He asked, “Alice, most of your strongest sword techniques are reliant on Sylph’s power, right?” 
Alice blinked in surprise at the question, then nodded. “Yes, I can’t use pure world-class sword techniques. I have to rely on Sylph’s augmentation to reach near-world-class levels.” 
“That simplifies things. You just need to learn a few world-class sword techniques. But…” Lin Tian had just started to relax when his brow furrowed again. 
World-class magic was relatively easy to find. 
But world-class sword techniques were exceedingly rare. 
The empire he was in lacked powerful sword-wielding knights, which meant world-class sword techniques were even more scarce. 
Lin Tian asked, “Do you know of any books or scrolls on world-class sword techniques? I’ll find a way to get them for you.” 
Alice thought for a moment and then shook her head helplessly. “I can’t think of anything. Sword Saint Edward knew such techniques, but he didn’t leave any books behind. Other than him, I don’t know of any skilled swordsmen.” 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian sighed. 
It seemed the only option would be to purchase such techniques from outside the wilderness. 
However, that would be extremely dangerous. 
Anyone who had mastered world-class sword techniques wouldn’t be lacking in money, and swordsmen tended to be proud individuals. 
They certainly wouldn’t trade their sword skills for gold. 
“Wait, I once heard someone mention that a group of powerful knights once tried to cross the Uninhabited Zone. Unfortunately, none of them returned. To honor them, a sword tomb was built at the edge of the Uninhabited Zone. Perhaps there might be world-class sword techniques buried with them!” Alice’s eyes lit up as she spoke. 
She was clearly excited at the mention of swordsmanship. 
Lin Tian was momentarily taken aback. Tomb raiding? 
Although it didn’t sound great, the entire wilderness belonged to him now, so it technically wasn’t grave robbing. 
It was more like reclaiming his own land. 
He quickly asked, “Do you know the exact location of this sword tomb?” 
Alice pondered carefully. “I’m not sure of the precise location, but it happened during the ancient Aesra Empire. According to records, the empire was located to the east, near the Zerg Empire.” 
Lin Tian nodded. “We’ll search along the eastern border of the Uninhabited Zone. We should be able to find the sword tomb. Let’s go. We only have a year, so we can’t waste time.” 
“Alright!” Alice nodded firmly. 
With the magic array Kassandra had set up in the Zerg Empire, the two of them instantly teleported there, saving several days of travel. 
… 
Inside the Zerg Empire, the Ant Queen continued to rule, producing goblins to station in the area. 
Lin Tian took the opportunity to gather some hybrid goblins to expand their search range. 
“Are you leaving already, Goblin Majesty? I feel like my energy is running low again. I need you to replenish it so I can continue producing. Please, I beg you!” The Ant Queen clung to Lin Tian’s feet, pleading. 
Alice stood nearby, utterly at a loss for what to make of the situation. 
She never imagined someone like this could exist. 
Suddenly, she remembered how she had once begged Lin Tian similarly, and she felt a wave of shame wash over her. Her head dropped in embarrassment. 
Lin Tian sighed. “Ant Queen, you’ll have to wait. But I have good news for you. I’ve fully subdued the Zerg Queen, and she’s now just a breeding tool. From now on, you can claim the title of Insect Queen for yourself.” 
“Really? That’s wonderful! So, how about rewarding me with one more session?” the Ant Queen persisted. 
Lin Tian didn’t bother continuing the conversation. He gathered a few thousand hybrid goblins and left. 
As he gazed out at the bleak, dark horizon, the land was lifeless and desolate. 
The air still held the lingering stench of blood and decay. 
“The Uninhabited Zone, huh? It’s about a few hundred miles away. Let’s go take a look.” Lin Tian spoke, looking toward the distance, where it seemed like a storm was brewing. 
That was the infamous Uninhabited Zone. 
The largest magic-infested area on the continent, teeming with countless monsters. No one even knew who ruled it. 
It wasn’t like the Great Tomb, which had a clear leader—Veronica. 
Soon enough, they reached the dark forest at the edge of the Uninhabited Zone. 
The vegetation was twisted and strange, entirely corrupted into black, magic-infested forms. 
The entire horizon was an endless stretch of the magic-infested forest. 
Perhaps it was because Lin Tian had lived in such places before, but he felt a strange sense of calm. Unlike the hybrid goblins, who trembled uncontrollably and shook with fear as they neared the forest’s edge. 
“Search along both sides,” Lin Tian ordered. “If you find anything resembling a grave or sword tomb, report back immediately.” 
With that command, the thousand hybrid goblins began to disperse, each heading in different directions to carry out the search.
