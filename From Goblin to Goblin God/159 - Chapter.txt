Chapter 159: Drinking Contest, Revenge on Grugia and Osius! 
TL: Sungmin 
Note: Terminology change—Super Empire changed to Great Empire. 
In the distance. 
Sylph’s pupils contracted sharply, and even the Darkspawn felt a sense of dread. 
They spoke in unison, “The Evil God is coming!” 
The Darkspawn, who had been joking around earlier, hoping Sylph would leave, suddenly became serious. “Is it the Black Goat Mother Goddess? If I’m not mistaken, it must be her. This is no fun, you all carry on.” 
After saying that, he fell into slumber. 
“This is bad! Alice, quickly catch up to that guy! I must seal him immediately, or the Evil God will arrive!” Sylph spoke in a panic. 
Alice sprinted at full speed, darting through the ruins. 
Due to Sylph’s wind power, her speed was unprecedented. 
In the blink of an eye, she caught up with the severely injured Child of the Evil God. 
“Wind Magic · Binding Wind of the Valley of the Dead!” 
The magic circle formed. 
The Child of the Evil God looked up, terrified, “No! Don’t seal me!” 
He tried to run forward, but the fierce wind blew him back a few steps, causing him to fall to the ground. 
“Swish!” 
The magic fell. 
A pitch-black void opened up, emitting a powerful suction force. 
It forcibly pulled the Child of the Evil God into it. 
The seal was complete. 
But Alice couldn’t stop trembling, “W-what’s happening to me?” 
“Kneel down quickly! Kneel on the ground, close your eyes tightly, cover your ears, and no matter what happens, do not move!” Sylph urgently instructed. 
She also disappeared from where she stood. 
The Darkspawn had long since hidden in fear, not daring to reveal his presence. 
In the distance, Gobu Kuang and his companions were also trembling, but didn’t know why. “Why is my body shaking? And why do I feel so uneasy?” 
Gobu Tian was equally puzzled. 
But his intuition told him that a powerful danger was approaching. 
Yet there was no place to hide. 
Even when he hid in the shadows, the threat of death did not diminish. 
Not to mention the other goblins. If it weren’t for the fact that the war had already been won, they would have collapsed by now. 
At this moment, Alice hurriedly instructed them to do the same as her. 
The goblins seemed to naturally kneel down. 
As if deep down, subconsciously, they had always wanted to do so. 
All of them knelt on the ground, not daring to lift their heads, not daring to look, not daring to listen. 
Meanwhile, Lawrence and the undead army were still highly vigilant, though deeply confused. 
In the ominously dark sky above. 
The space seemed to shatter as a gleam of light suddenly appeared, like a black sun! 
At first glance, it was clear that it was an eyeball. 
On the black crystalline surface, there were several vein-like red lines, with a small red pupil at the center. 
It was extremely eerie. 
But overall, it was enormous, watching everything below. 
It was none other than one of the Black Goat Mother Goddess’s eyes. 
It scanned the area a few times but found nothing unusual. 
Lawrence stared at the eye, filled with terror, dropping his sword as he half-kneeled on the ground. 
But he couldn’t look away. 
The Evil God’s Eye locked onto them, and with a slight movement of the pupil. 
“Swish!” 
The entire undead army seemed to evaporate! 
Vanished without a trace. 
Then. 
The eyeball slowly dissipated, and sunlight once again pierced through the dark clouds, shining down on the earth. 
Everything became eerily calm and peaceful. 
Alice finally stood up, “That… was that the Evil God?” 
Even her heart had been urging her to kneel, the pressure was too terrifying. 
It was as if the entire world had become hellishly oppressive due to her presence. 
And yet, that was just an eyeball. 
“It’s finally over. I wonder how happy the Boss will be when he sees we’ve taken this city? Haha!” 
Gobu Kuang stood up with lingering fear, but he smiled. 
Alice walked over and continued to issue orders, “It’s not over yet. We still need to take down the Magic Kingdom quickly, and the other territories and cities of the Sword Kingdom haven’t been dealt with. Don’t celebrate too soon.” 
This city only counted as a surprise attack. 
But the dukes and lords of the other cities would surely be on guard and have formed alliances. 
It would take much more time to completely take them down. 
The biggest regret was the annihilation of the undead army. 
Even the hundred-meter-class abominations had been crushed without any chance to fight back. 
Losing such a powerful army was truly unfortunate. 
But the fight had to continue. 
Gobu Kuang composed himself, preparing to set out, “Let’s go. It’s always been the Boss leading us to victory. This time, we need to perform well! Make the Boss happy!” 
“That’s right, let’s show what we can do!” Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan echoed. 
Their morale was high. 
Alice reorganized the army, quickly resupplied, and then began their assault on the Magic Kingdom. 
… 
The Magic Kingdom 
Now leaderless, the royal capital’s nobles were embroiled in chaotic infighting, turning everything into a tangled mess. 
With a swift and decisive attack, it could be taken down in one fell swoop. 
… 
Inside the War Empire, 
At the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
“Come on, you’re not backing down already, are you?” 
Lin Tian taunted Grugia with a mocking tone, staring him down. 
To get his revenge on the two of them in a legitimate way, he had initiated a drinking contest. 
And it was one versus two. 
As long as one of them stayed sober, they would win. 
That was why they agreed to it. 
However, Grugia was already drenched in sweat. “Are you even human? You outdrank Big Sis and kept going for so long without a problem?” 
Urged on, he had no choice but to keep drinking. 
If anyone backed out halfway, they would be scorned by the entire guild. 
But the two of them were already considering that they’d rather be ridiculed than continue drinking. 
Because Lin Tian was staring at them with an exceedingly wicked grin. 
“Drink, drink, drink. If you get drunk, you get drunk. I won’t go too hard on you, don’t worry.” Lin Tian forced a friendly smile as he spoke. 
Osius, though fearful, could only grit his teeth and keep drinking. “Rookie, I’m telling you, don’t go too far, or I won’t let you off!” 
Knowing he was bound to lose, he tried to issue a threat first. 
Grugia chimed in as well, “That’s right, my methods are pretty nasty! You’d better hold back when the time comes, got it?” 
“Fine, I promise I won’t harm a hair on your heads, okay?” Lin Tian replied impatiently. 
They downed several more rounds. 
An hour later. 
Finally, both of them were so drunk that they passed out on the spot, collapsing into a deep sleep. 
A man quickly asked, “Bro, how are you planning to punish these two? Tell us!” 
They were all eager to know. 
A drinking contest? 
Wrong. 
It was all about messing with them! 
Lin Tian stroked his chin, suddenly coming up with a good idea. “Could you guys help me carry them outside?” 
“Sure thing!” 
“Let’s get to it!” 
“These two have messed with us enough in the past; today, we’ll give them a taste of their own medicine!” 
Everyone joined in with enthusiasm. 
They followed Lin Tian outside the guild and onto the busy street. 
Finally, they stopped in front of a shop called “Midnight Rose.” 
“Hmm? Dragon Slayer Guild boys? Come in, come in! We’ve just brought in some fresh roses, one of them hasn’t even had a customer yet—how about her for you?” 
At the door stood a plump, heavily made-up woman with a fawning smile. 
She was the shop’s owner, Red Rose. 
She pulled Lin Tian inside to offer her services. 
Lin Tian signaled the others to wait outside while he entered. 
Inside, the lighting was dim, and the air was filled with various intoxicating fragrances. 
Many were drinking, each with a woman by their side. 
The room was filled with lewd and lascivious laughter. 
From upstairs, faint, urgent, coquettish sounds could be heard. 
This place was anything but ordinary. 
Red Rose led Lin Tian to a private room and said, “Please wait a moment. With such a handsome young man, I’m in a bit of a bind. Let me bring out my best roses.” 
Soon enough. 
One by one, stunning women, each like a blooming rose, entered the room. 
There were about ten of them. 
They were all scantily clad, with exquisite faces and makeup designed to captivate men. 
Just one look. 
And any man’s hormones would surge instantly. 
For those with weak self-control, this would be heaven. 
However. 
Each woman had a haughty expression, full of disdain. “Boss, I’ve told you before, I don’t take anyone less than a noble.” 
“At the very least, they need to be super handsome. Why drag us here?” 
“I’m on break today! I want double pay, even if I don’t take anyone!” 
Hearing this. 
Red Rose signaled for them to calm down. “Relax, I promise you’ll be more than compensated!” 
She then pointed at Lin Tian. “Take a look at this fresh-faced young man, do you like him? And he’s from the Dragon Slayer Guild!” 
The roses turned their attention to Lin Tian. 
Immediately. 
Their eyes lit up! 
“Oh my, so young? I—I’m several years older than him, isn’t that wrong?” 
“Hey, cutie, how about I charge you half-price?” 
“Dragon Slayer Guild, huh? I won’t charge anything this time, as long as you promise to come back often, deal?” 
In an instant. 
The once-proud roses all crowded around, fawning over him. 
They reached out with their slender, fair arms, trying to hook him in. 
Or they draped their long legs in front of him. 
The tantalizing views and the alluring fragrances were all designed to entice Lin Tian. 
Normally. 
They were used to serving older men or those with peculiar looks. 
They were almost on the verge of throwing up from the usual clientele. 
So when they finally encountered someone young and fresh like this, who was also a member of the Dragon Slayer Guild, how could they not be tempted? 
Some of them even considered paying just to be with him. After all, from their perspective, if they could host Lin Tian, it would be Lin Tian who was getting the short end of the stick. 
Red Rose chuckled from the side, “Don’t rush, ladies. If this young man’s got the stamina, he might just take you all on at once, right?” 
“Ahem, Boss, I’m actually not here for that,” Lin Tian said, barely holding himself back. 
He had to clarify before things got out of hand. After all, there were so many people waiting outside. If they found out he was in here doing that, they’d probably chop him up when he came out. 
Red Rose paused in surprise, and the other women looked equally baffled. “Not here for that? Then what are you here for?!” 
Lin Tian slowly replied, “I’m here to sell.” 
“Sell what?” 
Red Rose was growing impatient, but considering he was from the Dragon Slayer Guild, she decided to be patient. 
But selling something here? That was absurd. 
Lin Tian glanced at the girls beside him, his eyes drifting downward. 
This gesture left them completely flustered. “Are you… are you gay?!” 
“Boring! No wonder he held out so long.” 
“What a pity, little brother. How about I help you out, and you’ll be back to normal in no time!” 
“Let him go. I’m willing to be that angelic sister who leads him back to the right path.” 
Lin Tian quickly cut them off, “You’ve got it wrong. I’m here to sell people. Two healthy, handsome men, for just a thousand gold coins. How about it?” 
“You can use them to cater to those with particular tastes. Ten gold per session, and after a hundred sessions, you’ll have made your money back, right?” 
“And I’m even willing to sign a contract, guaranteeing a hundredfold compensation if I go back on my word!” 
Hearing this, Red Rose’s eyes practically turned into gold coins. “Where? I’ll buy them! This kind of surefire profit is too good to pass up!” 
A thousand gold coins wouldn’t even buy you a decent slave, and now she could get two men for that price! 
Plus, with a hundredfold penalty for backing out, there was no way Lin Tian would renege on the deal. 
“Boss, what would you even do with two men?” one of the women couldn’t help but ask, feeling like it was a losing proposition. 
Red Rose just giggled, “I’ve been running this place long enough to know that quite a few men have… peculiar preferences. This will be a great way to expand our business.” 
“And even if the business doesn’t take off, keeping them around for personal use isn’t a bad idea either, hehe…” 
As she spoke, Red Rose’s grin grew wider. 
Lin Tian joined in the laughter, “You two thought you could mess with me, huh? Well, this lovely 300-pound lady will be your new owner from now on.”
