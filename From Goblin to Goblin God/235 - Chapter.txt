Chapter 235: Ultimate Judgment, Infinite Divine Power 
TL: Sungmin  
Javier immediately became alert. “This aura… it’s extremely ominous.” 
Even angels were extremely wary of heresy. 
Veronica kept walking, and her magic was already unleashed! 
Five colossal magic circles unfolded slowly in the sky, their eerie glows dazzling to the eyes! 
A mass of black demonic energy descended from above! 
It was none other than the heretical creature previously summoned—Night Demon! 
Combat power: 17,000. 
However, Veronica was now fully capable of controlling the Night Demon. 
The sky and earth instantly turned black! 
The Night Demon’s chilling, haunting cries echoed like a death knell, filling the air without end! 
The overwhelming pressure even made Javier wary, “It’s you?! The one who defeated Douglas’ creature?” 
“I didn’t expect angels to remember that incident. Are they really that petty?” Veronica teased. 
Lin Tian’s lips curled slightly. “You’ve grown this much already?” 
From his status screen, Lin Tian could see that Veronica’s combat power had reached over 17,000. 
She was fully capable of controlling the Night Demon. 
Veronica chuckled softly. “Ever since I started living the life I wanted, my strength grew rapidly. Maybe… I’ve awakened.” 
“Stop spouting nonsense. Be careful of this one—it’s overwhelmingly strong!” Lin Tian suddenly became serious. 
He had underestimated the strength of demigods after dealing with Joan of Arc so easily. 
Now, he finally understood the danger. 
At that moment, the Night Demon let out a spine-chilling howl! The sound waves rushed toward Javier in an instant. 
Once surrounded by the sound waves, she would lose all vision! 
Javier’s heart tightened. “Damn heretical creature!” 
She looked around, panicked, as her sword hand began to sweat. 
She couldn’t see anything. She couldn’t feel anything! 
Which meant she was going to get hit! 
Suddenly— 
Ghostly tendrils shot out from the Night Demon’s body, slamming down hard on Javier! 
Fortunately, her Holy Light Protection was a passive skill. 
It blocked the tentacle attacks. 
The repelled tendrils crashed to the ground, shaking the earth with thunderous booms! 
Veronica called out urgently, “That’s the best the Night Demon can do! She can’t see anything right now, Lin Tian, it’s your turn!” 
“Hmph, you don’t need to remind me.” 
Lin Tian pulled out the Spear of Zeus once more. 
This time, instead of throwing it from afar, he charged directly at Javier! 
He thrust it fiercely at her armor! 
Clang! 
Sparks flew! 
The cross-shaped holy shield blocked the blow again. 
Lin Tian had anticipated this, pushing the spear deeper with all his might! 
It pierced through the armor, stabbing into her tender flesh! 
“Ah…” 
Javier let out a soft grunt, though the wound wasn’t severe. “Wretched, vile creature, die!” 
She frantically swung her sword, forcing Lin Tian to retreat. 
“What? Is that all you’ve got? How did I ever lose to someone like you?” Veronica mocked. 
Just a light stab, barely a flesh wound. 
Such a great opportunity had been wasted. 
The Night Demon’s howl could only last a minute—after that, it’d all be over. 
Lin Tian smirked arrogantly. “You’ve barely been out here for a minute, and you’re already looking down on me? Watch carefully!” 
The cross-shaped holy shield that had been blocking the Night Demon’s tentacle attacks began to dim and weaken. 
“Crack!” 
A sharp sound echoed! 
The holy shield shattered, and the tentacles slammed down hard on Javier, sending her flying several hundred meters away! 
She carved a long trench into the ground as she slid! 
The Night Demon pursued relentlessly. 
With several more slams, feathers burst and scattered from the dust-filled air! 
“Whoosh!” 
Javier barely recovered in time, flying into the air. But she was already badly injured, blood dripping from her mouth. Her face was filled with shock. “Goblin! What did you do to me? My power… it’s being corrupted!” 
Before her, the edges of the holy shield she had summoned were blackened and corroding. 
It flickered weakly, unstable. 
“Is that all? The real show’s about to start!” 
At Lin Tian’s command, all the monsters launched a fierce assault! 
Gobu Kuang, Little Black, the dwarves’ magical devices, and the other demi-human monsters! 
All of them could now deal damage to her. 
Her resistance had been lowered by Blood of Ruin, and her holy-type defenses weakened significantly. 
Although she could still kill the monsters in one blow, she was now taking real damage in return. 
Gobu Kuang fired four beams of light, while Gobu Tian darted around behind her, forcing Javier to split her attention. 
Gobu Shan launched his Evil Bones from a distance. 
The dwarves’ magic devices launched relentless attacks. 
Little Black and Spark kept up their long-range harassment. 
Neither the composite flame nor the flames of annihilation dared to be treated lightly anymore, forcing Javier to either dodge or deflect them. 
Very soon, she was covered in wounds! 
And her strength was nearly exhausted! 
“Hahaha! Are we really about to slay a god?!” 
“An angel will fall at our hands!” 
“We will be the first to defeat an angel on this continent! We will become legends!” 
The excited monsters shouted. 
… 
Meanwhile, in Heaven— 
Watching the scene unfold, Loxie began to panic. “How can this be happening? Javier was fine just a moment ago, but ever since that goblin stabbed her, why has her strength weakened so much?!” 
She wasn’t the only one. 
The other angels also looked confused and worried. 
Even Gabriel was intrigued. “That goblin is extraordinary… but don’t worry, Javier’s true power hasn’t been unleashed yet.” 
… 
Back on the Barren Rock Wasteland— 
Lin Tian examined Javier’s status screen closely. 
Especially her first skill: “Ultimate Judgment: Unleashes divine power, fully transforming into a four-winged archangel, releasing unprecedented holy strength for a limited time to purge all evil!” 
At that moment— 
Javier lay on the ground, her body covered in scars. 
The group didn’t continue attacking her. Instead, they turned to Lin Tian, asking, “Boss, what do you want to do? Should we capture her and vent our anger properly?” 
“Everyone, get away from her!!!” 
After reading the skill description, Lin Tian immediately shouted! 
But it was too late. 
Javier, with her eyes closed and her weakened body, slowly began to float. Beneath her main wings, a pair of smaller wings suddenly radiated a blinding holy light! 
Her entire form turned into a glowing mass, making it impossible to see her clearly! 
The intense light stung everyone’s eyes. 
“Whoosh!” 
The sound of wings beating echoed through the air! 
Feathers scattered everywhere, and for a moment, time itself seemed to stop. 
Javier hovered in the air, her two pairs of enormous wings glowing brilliantly. Her holy and powerful aura filled the entire sky! 
She had forcibly dispelled the Night Demon’s dark buff, bringing light back to the land, reviving everything! 
“You vile, filthy, fallen, sinful, evil creatures—I shall execute you in the name of justice!!!” 
Javier slowly opened her eyes, and golden light burst forth! 
Her voice was ethereal and deep, resonating through the space, lingering for what felt like eternity! 
At that moment, she appeared as though she ruled this entire domain! 
The most provoked one was the Night Demon, which let out another horrific, chilling howl, and swung its seven or eight tendrils toward her, slamming down fiercely! 
“Swish!” 
A golden slash appeared in the air, as if it tore through space itself! 
The Night Demon, along with the slash, was cleaved in two! 
“What?! The Night Demon… the Night Demon was killed in one strike? How is this possible?!” Veronica exclaimed in shock. 
Panic and unease surged wildly inside her, nearly driving her to the brink of collapse! 
She continued, “How… how did the divine power inside her suddenly become this strong?!” 
It felt as if they were witnessing the descent of a true god! 
The overwhelming power of a being from a higher dimension! 
In that moment, the other monsters fell to their knees, wailing in agony, almost crushed to death by the divine aura! 
Even Gobu Kuang and the others, who possessed the Hero’s Power, couldn’t withstand it! 
They immediately lost their fighting strength. 
Kneeling on the ground, their bodies were wracked with chills! 
It was as if they were condemned criminals facing their final judgment, helpless and filled with despair! 
Lin Tian himself hadn’t expected that the activation of a demigod’s skill would result in such overwhelming power! 
Javier’s combat strength had soared from 17,000 to 20,000! 
It was the first time he had seen such a value! 
The key issue was that even Blood of Ruin couldn’t suppress the outpouring divine power! 
It was too concentrated, too overpowering! 
It would take at least a full vial of Blood of Ruin to suppress it—there wasn’t nearly enough on the Spear of Zeus. 
But now, thinking of fighting was pure madness! 
Lin Tian quickly ordered, “Retreat! Everyone, retreat if you can!” 
Upon hearing this— 
Javier’s eyes filled with disdain. “You think you can escape? Under my Judgment Sword, all evil must die! World-Class Magic: Judgment Court!!!” 
“Humm!” 
Suddenly, everyone felt as if they had been pulled into an ancient Roman execution ground! 
The scent of death permeated the air, spreading relentlessly! 
Faced with such a hopeless scene, Lin Tian remained calm. After all, he could always revive—but he wasn’t pleased. 
“I’ll come back, and when I do, I’ll crush you like the garbage you are! Remember that!” Lin Tian coldly glared at Javier, his tone filled with contempt. 
Seeing this, Javier was somewhat surprised. “No matter how powerful the monster, under the Ultimate Judgment, they should be trembling and kneeling in fear. But you, a mere goblin, are still so calm?” 
As she looked at Lin Tian, it didn’t feel like she was conversing with a lowly monster. 
It felt as though she was speaking to a being of the same level! 
Javier raised her sword high, preparing to execute her final judgment, “Come back as many times as you like. I’ll just judge and execute you again, no matter how many times!” 
“Wait! Your Highness the Angel!” Suddenly, Alice, who had been silent this whole time, spoke up. 
Javier paused, slightly taken aback. “The fallen saintess… come forth, and I will grant you redemption.” 
In this moment, she appeared like a loving, benevolent god, guiding the lost to salvation. 
Alice slowly walked toward her. 
Javier was very pleased. “Good. You will certainly find redemption, but first, let me execute these evil creatures one by one!” 
As she spoke, she raised her sword again, ready to finish off Lin Tian. 
The next second! 
Divine feathers scattered! 
Javier’s entire being dimmed. She staggered backward a few steps, her face full of disbelief. 
With shock, she uttered three words: “Why?” 
In her abdomen, a long sword was now embedded—the Ominous Blade. 
Darkspawn energy pulsed through the blade. 
Only by releasing a portion of the Darkspawn’s power could Alice have pierced Javier’s defenses. Otherwise, in her current state, Alice wouldn’t have stood a chance. 
“Why are you helping an evil creature? Why are you so stubborn? Were the scriptures you heard in the church all lies?” Javier asked in utter confusion. The pain and the draining of her strength were driving her toward an emotional breakdown. 
Alice closed her eyes and clenched her teeth. “Please… don’t wake me from this beautiful dream!” 
“Beautiful dream? You… you’re beyond saving!” Javier snarled, her expression twisted with rage. 
Alice didn’t respond. She simply pulled the Ominous Blade from Javier’s body, watching as golden blood slowly flowed from the wound. 
In truth, Alice had known for some time that Lin Tian wasn’t some divine messenger. 
But ever since the incident at the royal city, she had grown to despise humans deep in her heart. 
And there was no going back.
