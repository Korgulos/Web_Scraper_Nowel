Chapter 83: Young Goblin Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai 
TL: Sungmin  
Lin Tian was tightly wrapped by the huge, soft tongue inside the dragon’s mouth, unable to move. 
Crucially, it was like a piece of candy, being repeatedly licked and sucked by the tongue. 
His soul felt like it was about to be sucked away. 
“How did this guy grow so fast, yet still act like a little kid? Stop playing around, I’m your father!” 
Lin Tian cursed and grumbled, feeling like he had been thrown into a washing machine. 
Finally, Nidhogg opened its mouth, “Mom, is this person really my father?” 
Looking at the strange surroundings, Lin Tian felt this adventure was too fantastical. 
The area was filled with thick, dark tree roots, intricately intertwined, each one like a mountain blocking out the sky. 
Nidhogg looked like a small bug on the branches. 
No surprise, these were the roots of the World Tree. 
Suddenly, a dragon’s head emerged from the roots in front of him, looking very familiar. 
“Purple-Gold Dragon Mother? How did you end up inside the tree?!” Lin Tian said with an expression of disbelief. 
Seeing him, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother seemed both surprised and delighted, “It’s you, little guy? I didn’t expect to see you again! Oh my, did that crazy woman not find you?” 
Crazy woman? 
Lin Tian quickly understood, “She did, but now she’s a member of my tribe and is pregnant with my child.” 
“No way, are you serious? Alicenia, the Sword Saintess! She joined the Goblin Tribe and is pregnant with your child!” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother was dumbfounded. 
She doubted her hearing, thinking it might be impaired due to relying on the World Tree to live. 
Lin Tian patted his chest, “Our relationship is real, would I lie to you? By the way, why are you staying inside the tree, come out quickly.” 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother was excited, “It’s really satisfying to hear that. I’m actually dead, living only by relying on the World Tree, because I was killed by that crazy woman.” 
“Little Black, this is your father. Don’t underestimate him; he’s really different from other goblins.” 
Nidhogg’s previous ferocity was gone, its big eyes now looking adorably innocent, appearing harmless and even cute. 
Full of disbelief, it extended its hot, red tongue and licked Lin Tian again, “Fa… Father…” 
Then, the dragon’s face turned slightly red. 
“They call her Despair, but she’s actually very shy and bashful.” 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother couldn’t help but laugh. 
Maybe she was the only one who believed that. 
Shy and bashful? She almost ate him in one bite at the start. 
Every dragon avoided her; her cave was full of dragon bones. 
Lin Tian felt awkward and symbolically sighed, then patted Little Black’s scales. 
For a moment, Nidhogg shyly backed away, then flapped its immense wings, flying quickly among the tangled roots. 
It seemed very happy. 
“By the way, isn’t our child growing too abruptly? It’s been less than a year, and she’s already bigger than you?” Lin Tian couldn’t help but ask. 
He had heard that ancient dragons grew very slowly and needed to eat a lot every day. 
If they didn’t eat enough, they almost wouldn’t grow. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother pondered, “Maybe it’s related to you. Goblins grow very quickly, don’t they?” 
At this, Lin Tian finally understood. 
Then, he asked about the main issue, “By the way, do you know the whereabouts of the dwarves? I heard they’ve disappeared. I have some matters to attend to.” 
“Dwarves? I only heard rumors. Have Little Black take you to see the Dragon King; she must know. My body isn’t fully formed yet, I need to rest. Thank you for avenging me, and someday, I must see what that crazy woman looks like now!” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother returned to the tree after speaking. 
The anger in her heart had completely dissipated. 
At this moment, Lin Tian looked up and saw two adorable big eyes watching him from above. 
“Father… are we leaving now?” Nidhogg said softly, afraid her tone was too harsh. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but smile with satisfaction, “Yes, let’s go see your Dragon King.” 
However, the big tongue extended again right after. 
Lin Tian wanted to stop it, but outside was a sea of molten lava; without it, he would be burned to death. 
Finally, he struggled his way to the outside of the cave. 
Only then did he realize that many dragons had gathered around the lava behind him. 
And there was one enormous dragon he had never seen before! Bigger than Little Black and the scarred one from before! 
It was the Flame Dragon Mother. 
Seeing Lin Tian, the Flame Dragon Mother had a complicated expression, “Are you really Despair’s father? You are indeed a goblin.” 
The dragons behind her looked at Lin Tian and Little Black being close. 
They all showed expressions of disbelief. 
“Oh my, is there actually a creature that can get so close to Despair?!” 
“Doesn’t she eat everything? She even ambushed and ate several dragons.” 
“Incredible!” 
The dragons behind them started discussing one after another. 
They were still surprised that Lin Tian had mated with the Flame Dragon Mother. 
Scar now believed it, saying, “I didn’t expect it, Ferbis actually mated with a different race… It’s a pity that the pure bloodline of the Crystal Dragon is lost forever.” 
“Scar, do you really think it’s a pity?” At this moment, a red dragon with a broken horn, full of amusement in his eyes, asked. 
He was Sin. 
Those two horns were chopped off after he committed his sins. 
Hearing this, Scar was speechless. 
The other dragons sighed, thinking the pure bloodline of the Crystal Dragon couldn’t compare to the current Nidhogg. 
In terms of growth speed, ferocity, and strength. 
Nidhogg was the first of its kind in the history of the ancient dragons. 
Finally, Lin Tian looked at the Flame Dragon Mother and answered, “Dragon King, I have no malicious intent in coming here. I just want to inquire about the location of the Dwarf Kingdom.” 
Dwarves? 
Upon hearing this, the dragons were slightly surprised. 
At this moment, a giant dragon with white scales, wings that resembled those of an angel, and surrounded by lightning, coldly said, “The dwarves were exterminated by humans long ago. You won’t find them anymore.” 
Because dwarves also had another name, gnomes. 
They were categorized as monsters. 
Gnome was a large category that included goblins, dwarves, and gnomes. 
“All dead? That can’t be…” Lin Tian felt disappointed, realizing his trip was in vain. 
However, the Flame Dragon Mother said, “I know of a branch of dwarves that still exists, but you must agree to two conditions.” 
“Please speak. If I can help, I certainly will,” Lin Tian’s eyes lit up as he quickly responded. 
The dragons fell silent. 
They were all waiting for the Flame Dragon Mother to speak. After thinking for a long time, she said, “First, you must make sure Despair no longer hunts her kin.” 
“But what if they bully her?” Lin Tian hesitated, glancing at Despair, who was tilting her head with big, adorable eyes. 
After all, she was just a few months old. 
She didn’t know the dangers of the world. 
If she was directly made to lose her fighting spirit, it would be bad if she encountered villains. 
Scar added, “Then only if they don’t harm her first.” 
“No problem, Little Black, listen to your father. Good children do as they’re told, understood?”  
Nidhogg nodded vigorously. 
Lin Tian said, “From now on, you are not allowed to harm these dragons unless they try to harm you.” 
“But… I often get very hungry,” Nidhogg looked at the dragons with a greedy and reluctant gaze. 
It made them all shiver involuntarily. 
Although she only killed the dragons who mocked her for being a goblin descendant, it was still terrifying. 
Scar quickly said, “In the future, if you need to eat, come to me, and I’ll catch food for you. It’s strange, we can go months without eating after a meal, but why are you hungry again in the afternoon after eating in the morning?” 
Nidhogg bit her claw, looking very innocent. 
“Alright, what’s the second condition?” 
Lin Tian then looked at the Flame Dragon Mother. 
The more he looked, the more he felt this dragon was captivating. Not only was she powerful, but her beautiful scales and lines were perfect. 
Like a sculpture. 
Exuding a majestic aura that other dragons wouldn’t dare to have. 
The Flame Dragon Mother hesitated, her proud and commanding gaze showing a hint of shyness. She glanced around at the other dragons. 
She seemed embarrassed to speak. 
“You have to come with me personally to know this.” 
After speaking, the Flame Dragon Mother opened her large mouth and wrapped Lin Tian in her soft tongue. 
Then she flew into the distant lava waterfall. 
There was a huge, high cave under the waterfall, surrounded by volcanic rock. 
The light from the magma illuminated the cave, making it look like an endless sunset. 
It was unexpectedly beautiful. 
“Can you tell me now?” 
After emerging from the dragon’s mouth, Lin Tian asked directly. 
He came to inquire about the dwarves and didn’t have much time to deal with other things. 
The faster, the better. 
Turning around, he found the Flame Dragon Mother had disappeared. 
Instead, a noble girl stood in front of him. 
Dressed in red, with black stockings, her enchanting eyes and those dragon horns gave an exciting feeling. 
Lin Tian instinctively took a half-step back, “Dragon King? What’s this…” 
“I don’t want to beat around the bush. The second condition is to bear a stronger dragon with you. As long as you agree, I’ll tell you the coordinates of the dwarves.” 
The Flame Dragon Mother extended her leg from her red dress. 
Half-black stockings, with a white thigh. 
It was mouthwatering. 
Lin Tian never expected to have such luck! It felt so unreal, like a dream. 
Who would willingly offer themselves? 
Seeing his lack of reaction, the Flame Dragon Mother grew angry, “Do you agree or not?” 
Her beautiful face had a few fiery scales. 
Like the reverse scale of a dragon, untouchable. 
Lin Tian finally reacted and asked, “Dragon King, are you serious? Me?” 
He wasn’t the kind to be driven by lust. 
He was professional unless he couldn’t help it. 
“Do you think the Dragon King would joke with you? Besides, if you refuse, you won’t leave this lava cave.” The Flame Dragon Mother threatened. 
Lin Tian didn’t say another word. He stepped forward and pinned her down. 
Tearing at her clothes and stockings. 
The Flame Dragon Mother felt both angry and ashamed. Given her status, she at least needed some mental preparation. This was too sudden! 
The key was, he seemed intent on ravaging her. 
How could she live if other dragons saw this? 
“I can’t help it anymore. I’ll ask you anything later!” 
“You… Be gentle, I’m the Dragon King. Don’t hit me so hard! This feels like I’m a horse! I’m a noble dragon!” 
“I don’t care if you’re a dragon or a horse, aren’t you all meant to be ridden?” 
“You! You!” 
In her shame and anger, the Flame Dragon Mother’s eyes trembled, feeling tears about to fall. She covered her mouth, trying not to make a sound. 
It hurt! It hurt so much! 
She finally couldn’t bear it and begged for mercy, “Wait, I can’t take it. I need to transform back!” 
She immediately turned into a giant dragon. 
Unfortunately. 
This was no challenge for Lin Tian. 
Having devoured the abilities of the Evil Goblin, even a titanness thousands of meters tall could be subdued! 
Moments later. 
The Flame Dragon Mother’s massive lava body seemed to melt away. 
She lay on the ground, exhausted. 
Panting heavily. 
Lin Tian sighed, “If I weren’t in a hurry, how could I end the battle this fast? Dragon King, are you taking me as a god of fertility?” 
Life was tough for him. 
Couldn’t he have a grand romance? 
“I demand the author change the title to ‘Young Goblin Does Not Dream of Bunny Girl Senpai’!” 
Lin Tian shouted in his heart. Even with a Sword Saintess and a Dragon King, there was still no love. 
At best, Gobu Yue counted a little.
