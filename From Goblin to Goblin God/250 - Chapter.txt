Chapter 250: The Fool Turned Out to Be Me 
TL: Sungmin  
Facing the two-to-three-meter-tall monster in front of him, Lin Tian felt an overwhelming sense of dread. Most of the creature’s body was a massive, gaping mouth, filled with jagged teeth, and its sheer presence was terrifying. 
Its rough skin resembled the bark of a birch tree. 
The second floor of the tavern was creaking, on the verge of collapsing under the pressure. 
The powerful aura radiating from the creature was suffocating. 
This was a Soul Devourer, a complex monster that lived in the desolate Necromancer’s Canyon. Originally, it was a wandering undead, but after devouring other undead, it slowly evolved into a physical form. 
Until it became what stood before them now. 
Like a type of parasitic evolution, any creature that could transform into a Soul Devourer was immensely powerful. 
It didn’t even need to attack. Any living being within its vicinity would suffer continuous soul assaults. 
If exposed to it for too long, one’s soul could be frightened into fleeing their body. 
Which would essentially result in instant death. 
Seeing this, Lin Tian couldn’t help but curse, “You slut, you’ve really gone so far as to mess with something like this?” 
The Lust Demon King had a short-lived ability to mimic others, but to permanently record someone’s form, she needed to engage in an intimate act with them. 
Once that was done, she could transform into that person at will. 
“Hmph, the desire for beauty and the desire for power are both forms of lust. What’s the difference? Soon, you’ll understand why I did this!” Scarlett said, her voice laced with contempt, and then suddenly swung her fist. 
Crack! 
The entire tavern finally gave way, collapsing into rubble. 
Lin Tian quickly leaped into the street, and the others, having heard the commotion, had already fled. 
Suddenly. 
While watching the debris, Lin Tian felt a chill down his spine. At some point, Scarlett had appeared behind him. 
Without hesitation, he used Ruinous Howl to create distance between them! 
Surprisingly, Scarlett barely flinched, only rippling like water, without losing consciousness or even blinking. 
“You fool. The Soul Devourer might have a physical body, but physical attacks won’t work on me!” she sneered. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian understood. While it had evolved, it was still essentially an undead, though far more powerful than regular undead. 
“Come out. Deal with her properly,” Lin Tian commanded. 
At his words, goblins began emerging from the shadows around him, their bodies radiating a powerful holy energy. 
Holy Light Goblins! 
In the past, Lin Tian had no effective way to deal with undead monsters. Goblins lacked mages. 
But now, thanks to the queen, he had a brood of Holy Light Goblins at his disposal, compensating for that weakness. 
Even though they were low-tier goblins, untrained and underdeveloped, they had numbers on their side. 
“You tricked me?! You knew it was me this whole time?!” Scarlett’s face twisted with rage as she realized what had happened. 
Lin Tian suppressed a mocking smile, “Cough, cough. I really wanted to thank you, but I also had to be prepared for your betrayal.” 
From the start, he had anticipated her sudden betrayal, so he had hidden these goblin soldiers in advance. 
Hearing this. 
Scarlett was enraged and humiliated, realizing that she had been nothing more than a fool, serving herself up to be used and discarded. 
What infuriated her even more was that each time she had endured agonizing pain, it had all been in vain—he had known all along! He had just been toying with her! 
“Bastard! In all my millennia, I’ve encountered many bastards, but none as despicable as you goblins! I’ll exterminate every last one of you!!!” 
Swish! 
In her furious roar, Scarlett’s body morphed like clay, transforming into countless sharp spikes that shot out in all directions! 
The surrounding buildings were reduced to ashes! 
Hundreds, if not thousands, of Holy Light Goblins perished in the onslaught! 
But immediately, more goblins swarmed toward her. 
They completely engulfed her! 
The sizzling sound of her searing power echoed from within the mass of goblins. 
Lin Tian watched from a distance, reluctant to intervene. He couldn’t help but feel bad—he had used her for so long, gaining incredible power from it, and seeing her cry out in pain each time had made him feel a twinge of guilt. 
For the first time, he realized just how cruel he had become. 
But unexpectedly, even though more and more goblins rushed at her, their numbers dwindled rapidly! 
The Soul Devourer was growing larger and larger! 
It had been only two or three meters tall moments ago, but now it stood as tall as a building—over ten meters! 
From within the Soul Devourer, ghostly hands emerged, grabbing the approaching goblins and pulling them into its body to devour and absorb! 
Not only did it devour their souls, but it also consumed their physical forms, growing stronger with each bite. 
The low-tier Holy Light Goblins’ attacks were nothing more than a mild irritation to it. 
Scarlett sneered, “Is that all the soldiers you have? Keep them coming! Make me even stronger!” 
“Bleh!” 
She spat out a torrent of souls. 
These were the goblins she had just consumed, and they began spreading throughout the city, capturing other creatures to bring back for her to devour. 
Lin Tian frowned. This was quickly becoming a huge problem. 
He hadn’t expected to underestimate her this much. 
However, having grown to this point, it was clear that even if he fought her directly, he still wouldn’t be able to kill her. 
“Your Majesty, Lin Tian, leave this to me.” 
Suddenly, a familiar voice rang out. 
In the dark, deserted street, Alice’s figure slowly appeared. 
As the souls rushed toward her, a flash of her sword sliced through them, reducing them to wisps of smoke. 
Lin Tian snapped to attention, realizing that he had almost forgotten they had a powerful magic swordswoman in their ranks!  
A warrior who wielded incredibly strong holy powers alongside several formidable sword techniques! 
Seeing this, Scarlett sneered mockingly. “Oh? Is it you? The saintess who slept with goblins? Little girl, why not join me instead? I can give you pleasure far beyond what any goblin could offer! A sensation you can’t even imagine!” 
Scarlett continued, her voice dripping with twisted amusement, “Even if you like goblins, I can turn into one and play with you~ I can become an orc, a troll, an angel, a human. Tall, thin, fat, short, big, small! Whatever you want!” 
However, Alice’s expression remained unchanged.  
Cold and emotionless, just like the moonlight shining down that night. 
“World-class Sword Skill: Final Chapter Sword Song!” 
Voom! 
The hum of magical energy spread through the air, vibrating the entire space. 
An unnamed, awe-inspiring orchestral BGM filled the world, high-pitched and tragic! 
Above Scarlett, five massive magic circles formed, blotting out the sky! 
From the circles descended an immense pressure, searing and overwhelming! 
The very earth trembled under its force! 
Suddenly, a blazing greatsword, burning with fiery light, plummeted from the heavens! It looked like an apocalypse sword, ready to cleanse the world. 
Seeing this, Scarlett let out a disdainful laugh, “Physical attacks? I’m immune to th—” 
Boom! Boom! Boom! 
The giant sword struck, shaking Goblin King’s city as if a magnitude-ten earthquake had hit. People were nearly knocked unconscious from the force! 
Scarlett was completely consumed by the sword. Lin Tian could see her body being crushed, exploding from every direction as it was pulverized! 
Even though she was immune to physical damage, the sheer force still caused her to burst apart. 
The sword’s power continued to rage on. 
Lin Tian quickly called out, “That’s enough, Alice! If you keep going, the entire city will be destroyed!” 
Hearing this. 
Alice finally stopped her magic. 
Before them lay a crater several hundred meters wide, as if a meteor had struck. Everything in its path had been reduced to dust under the pressure of the sword. 
At that moment. 
The scattered fragments of the Soul Devourer, blown apart across the area, began moving.  
In no time, they started merging again!
