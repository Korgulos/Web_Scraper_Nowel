Chapter 23: Battle Against the Silver Blade Knight Regiment 
TL: Sungmin 
Immediately, Lin Tian needed to enhance his strength; otherwise, facing a group of hero-level goblins, he might not be able to establish his authority. 
Ever since mating with the wyvern he brought, his attributes had grown. 
Health: 1200, Strength: 320, Defense: 400. 
The transformation of his qualities was better than expected. He didn’t need to spend time evolving to obtain attributes that other goblins would have after evolution. 
“System, open the system store.” 
Over this period, he had accumulated nearly two hundred life points, which could be obtained not only through the life simulation. 
Gaining new achievement titles also increased life points. 
[Iron Sword: 5 points 
Experience Fruit: 1 point 
Low-level Recovery Potion: 1 point 
Low-level Potential Fruit: 1 point, consuming it randomly increases an attribute by one point] 
These were all low-level items. 
Lin Tian carefully observed; there was nothing useful among the low-level items. 
Even the skills available for exchange were useless. 
He then looked at the slightly better quality and more expensive section. 
[Excellent Iron Sword: 10 points 
Large Experience Fruit: 5 points 
Mid-level Recovery Potion: 5 points] 
Seeing this, Lin Tian couldn’t help but complain, “This is just like a mindless game from ten years ago. The player fights small lobsters at level 1, giant lobsters at level 10, rainbow lobsters at level 50, and supreme god-demon lobsters at level 100. Damn, let’s look at the high-level items.” 
In the high-quality section, it was mainly divided into ‘Equipment,’ ‘Skills,’ ‘Items,’ and ‘Others.’ 
Based on Lin Tian’s current attributes, he wasn’t weak, quite strong actually. 
But he didn’t have a handy weapon or a powerful skill. 
Fighting would be tough. 
With 180 life points, he could probably exchange for something. 
He first checked the equipment section. 
[Flame Longsword: 50 points, enchanted with fire element, causing fire damage upon attack.] 
[Magic Sword: 70 points, inscribed with ancient runes, can absorb and store some magical attacks and then release them.] 
[Elemental Hand Crossbow: 80 points, capable of absorbing elemental power and firing elemental arrows. Usable elements: water, fire, wind, lightning, poison.] 
Looking at these weapons, Lin Tian pondered. 
The Flame Sword was the cheapest but not very useful. 
The Magic Sword had a good cost-performance ratio, but for Lin Tian’s small build, wielding a sword against a mage? 
Unrealistic. 
Moreover, the Sword Saintess mainly used physical attacks. 
The best choice, which also suited Lin Tian’s wallet, was the Elemental Hand Crossbow. 
Small in size, it could be equipped, though a bit expensive, but no need to look at more expensive ones. 
The key was its long-range attack, very suitable for stealthy actions. 
He clicked to exchange. 
Immediately, the Elemental Hand Crossbow appeared in the system warehouse. 
He could retrieve it anytime he wanted. 
But Lin Tian didn’t hurry and instead checked the ‘Skills’ section. 
This section mainly had high-tier skills. 
He had a hundred life points left. 
He could barely exchange for a high-tier one, but super-tier and above were out of the question. 
[No-Blade Capture: 80 points, triumph without a blade, can catch the enemy’s weapon attacks barehanded three times.] 
[Necromancer’s Call: 100 points, summons nearby souls for use, lasting 180 seconds, useful in large-scale battles.] 
[Boiling Blood: 100 points, increases attack power, becoming stronger the longer the battle, maxing out at triple the attack power, lasting 10 minutes, but drastically reducing attack power for 3 minutes afterward.] 
These skills all looked good. 
Especially the Necromancer’s Call, which could double the forces, though for a short duration, it could turn the tide. 
But it clearly required a lot of magic power. 
Most species in this world had some magic, but Lin Tian wasn’t suitable to be a mage now and hadn’t even touched it yet. 
Boiling Blood was decent, neither too good nor too bad. 
Very useful in single combat. 
Ultimately, he chose No-Blade Capture. 
A life-saving skill, so it was. 
“Exchange successful! Skill has been issued to the warehouse.” 
Lin Tian looked at the remaining 20 life points. What could he do with these? 
Save them? 
They were far from the super-tier skill he wanted, which needed 300 points. 
[Evil God’s Blessing: 300 points, can summon a puppet of the Evil God equivalent to a sixth-tier monster to protect the user, which will not disappear until killed.] 
With this skill, his power would significantly increase. 
Unfortunately, he lacked enough life points. 
Even if he used them, there was nothing worth exchanging for. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but ask, “System, besides gaining one point per day and the life simulation, is there any other way to get life points?” 
“The host can also earn life points by completing tasks issued by the system. The tasks are random and usually appear when making significant life decisions.” 
Hearing this, Lin Tian had no other options, so he decided to save the remaining 20 points. 
He opened the system warehouse and retrieved No-Blade Capture and the Elemental Hand Crossbow. 
He instantly learned the No-Blade Capture skill. 
In his hand, he now held the Elemental Hand Crossbow. 
He then equipped it on his left hand. 
It was about 30 centimeters long, very small, resembling a standard hand crossbow, but with two green, infusion tube-like things inserted into Lin Tian’s arm. 
Being a magical tool, it needed to connect to the body. 
When his hand approached various elements, the crossbow could charge. 
Since there were no elements nearby, Lin Tian secreted his own toxins, allowing the crossbow to absorb them. 
“Let’s find a target. How about that guy?” 
Lin Tian locked his gaze on the bound Loder, raised his left hand, and surprisingly noticed a targeting icon! 
Just like in a shooting game. 
Aim, shoot! 
“Ah! Who! Who’s attacking me?” 
Loder, who was sleeping, screamed in pain, cursing but unable to find anyone. 
The next second, his face changed drastically, “Body? Paralyzed? Damn goblins!” 
He couldn’t mistake this familiar feeling; it was the goblin’s paralyzing toxin. 
Lin Tian nodded in satisfaction, seeing the effect was good. 
After practicing for a while, he roughly understood the Elemental Hand Crossbow’s capabilities. 
Its range was 300 meters, not very far, but extremely accurate. 
It could store up to 50 shots, which could be evenly distributed among elements, ten shots each, or more for a specific element. 
Without access to more elements, he primarily stored poison elements. 
Long-range paralysis was quite useful. 
Loder clenched his teeth in anger but was also very anxious, “It’s been so long, why hasn’t the imperial family come to save me? Even if they think I’m dead, they should send someone for revenge!” 
He endured all kinds of suffering. 
Waiting for rescue. 
Otherwise, he would have bashed his head against a rock long ago. 
… 
At the same time. 
The Silver Blade Knight Regiment members were searching all over the enchanted forest. 
The female member was constantly shouting for help, hoping to attract the goblins’ attention. 
“Captain, there’s movement over there.” 
In the forest center, a third-tier demonic beast, a ‘Giant Eyed Spider,’ was wrapping up its freshly caught prey in silk. 
The Silver Blade Captain was startled, “Spider?! I fear spiders the most. You guys handle it quickly.” 
The archer in the group immediately drew his longbow and shot the cocoon down to the ground. 
Sensing something was wrong, the Giant Eyed Spider swiftly turned, its body as large as a small house, yet incredibly agile! 
Its eight long legs darted between towering trees. 
At this moment, a man stepped forward, holding a two-meter-long spear. 
He locked onto the spider darting around and suddenly threw the spear! 
“Screech!” 
The spear pinned the spider to a tree. 
The archer then shot an arrow into its head. 
Just like that, they killed a third-tier demonic beast in under three minutes. 
As expected of an elite knight regiment nurtured by the imperial family. 
“Do you think Loder might already be dead?” 
“Most likely, Count Stantmont reportedly almost fainted from rage.” 
“Forget it, let’s quickly wipe out all the goblin tribes.” 
After dealing with the spider, the Silver Blade Captain and his team continued forward.  
Sure enough, the goblins were drawn by a woman’s calls. 
The outcome was predictable. 
They easily wiped out a tribe of two hundred goblins. 
The Silver Blade Captain took out a small notebook and wrote a “1,” saying, “Clear about ten more, and we can return. Let’s keep going.” 
“These low-level, weak monsters don’t interest me at all.” 
“Then why didn’t you stay and slay the dragon earlier?” 
“I can handle a wyvern, but I don’t have the skill to slay an ancient dragon! Besides, if the ancient dragon race holds a grudge, we wouldn’t even know how we died.” 
As they chatted and laughed. 
The Silver Blade Knight Regiment had already easily wiped out five or six goblin tribes. 
At this moment, the mage, Antu, became cautious, “Wait, don’t you notice that the closer we get to the inner enchanted forest, we haven’t seen a single monster?” 
“Hiss! Now that you mention it, it does seem like that!” 
Instantly, everyone became alert. 
They could faintly smell the scent of blood in the air. 
This indicated a massacre was happening nearby. 
“Shush, shush…” 
Suddenly, there was a rustle in the bushes ahead. 
A green-skinned Big Goblin walked out, bumping right into the Silver Blade Knight Regiment. 
For a moment, the air seemed to freeze, as they looked at each other, speechless. 
“Is this a goblin? A Big Goblin?” 
Mage Antu was stunned. The goblin’s sudden appearance had caught them off guard. 
A goblin had just walked up to them. 
The Silver Blade Captain remarked, “Wow, look at this guy’s muscle definition, it could rival that bald guy from the Battle Roar Regiment!” 
At this moment, the Big Goblin was also dumbfounded. 
Roaming the enchanted forest for so long, searching for monsters to hunt, this was the first time he had encountered humans! 
A group of well-equipped humans. 
He quickly reacted, roaring, “Ah!” 
This immediately attracted the attention of other goblins nearby, who stopped what they were doing and looked towards the source of the sound. 
The Silver Blade Captain added, “Looks like we’ve found the reason why there are no monsters around here.”
