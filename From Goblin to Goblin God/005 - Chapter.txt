Chapter 5: Kill the Goblin Priest! 
TL: Sungmin 
[Life Simulation System is starting. Current scenario: Ironmaking 
Over ten days, you gathered some iron ore and crafted fifty iron spears. Your prestige in the entire tribe far surpassed that of the Goblin Priest. 
The goblins even started calling you “Boss.” 
The powerful Goblin Priest couldn’t accept such a situation and planned to kill you to reclaim his prestige. 
(Option 1: Design a plan to kill the Goblin Priest and take control of the tribe. Score: 20) 
(Option 2: Flee the tribe. Score remains unchanged.) 
(Option 3: Abandon your prestige, submit to the Goblin Priest, and bide your time, waiting for the best opportunity. Score: 10)] 
Escaping was impossible. Leaving now, after all you had done, would be a huge loss. 
Also, leaving would likely result in death in the enchanted forest. 
Submitting would delay your revenge. You couldn’t wait that long. 
So, you chose the first option. After all, the purpose of the Life Simulation System was to make mistakes and learn from them. 
If you failed, you could understand the situation better and prepare more effectively. 
[You wanted to rise to power in one move and poisoned the Goblin Priest’s food. 
However, the Goblin Priest turned the tables on you. He was cautious enough to feed the food to his pet mouse first. Your assassination attempt failed, and you escaped with severe injuries. 
You lingered in the enchanted forest for three months, surviving by madly mating with any suitable-sized creatures you caught. 
Half a year later, you finally evolved into a Big Goblin variant, the Goblin Warrior, and established a goblin tribe of over a hundred members. 
Each goblin was equipped with iron weapons and armor, making them extremely powerful. 
You led your army back to kill the Goblin Priest and took Gobu Yue with you. 
Through various channels, you learned that the stubbled man’s hero team was in the human territory of Bright Town, and you gathered all your forces to launch a surprise attack. 
Unfortunately, the Sword Saintess happened to be there to celebrate her disciple Loder’s birthday. You suffered heavy losses and barely escaped with Gobu Yue by using a magic array exchanged from the system. 
Another half year passed, and you established a medium-sized tribe of three hundred goblins and were on the verge of evolving into a hero variant, with three Big Goblin subordinates. 
Gobu Yue’s strength also improved significantly, and she grew into a beautiful goblin. 
… 
The current Life Simulation can last up to one year. Forced termination. 
Summary: You improved rapidly through hard work but suffered repeated setbacks due to bad luck. May the gods bless you~ 
Score: 50 out of 100 
Reward: 50 Life Points 
This Life Simulation is complete, with a time span of 365 days. 
Would you like to transmigrate to the final progress of the simulation? If you refuse, it cannot be changed later.] 
Lin Tian frowned slightly. Overall, evolving into a Big Goblin variant and nearly becoming a hero variant was quite good. 
The main issue was failing to kill the stubbled man. 
This significantly slowed down his growth. 
It seemed unnecessary. Since the grass had been stirred up, even if he transmigrated a year later to deal with the stubbled man, the latter would be prepared. 
It wouldn’t be easy to kill him. 
In general, the Life Simulation was a way to learn from mistakes and gain experience from failures. 
This time wasn’t perfect, but he could try again in ten days. 
Lin Tian returned to reality. He needed to deal with the old and cunning Goblin Priest. 
Poisoning didn’t work, so he had to rely on brute force. 
He decided to use all 50 Life Points to exchange for experience pills. 
Currently, his level cap was ten. He needed to continue devouring the flesh of powerful monsters or engage in mating. 
Humans? Capturing one would be too risky. 
Elves? Even more out of the question. 
Monsters were also difficult. The only female around was his little brother, Gobu Yue. 
After a brief hesitation, Lin Tian said, “Gobu Yue, I have something to discuss with you. Come with me to the forest.” 
“Okay, Boss!” 
Gobu Yue jumped up, waving her small hands and walking with large strides, looking very happy as she followed Lin Tian into the dark woods. 
The further they went, the quieter it became. The strange and unknown environment made Gobu Yue a bit scared. 
She kept looking around warily and said nervously, “Boss, how far are we going?” 
“Gobu Yue, what do you think of me?” 
They had reached a sufficient distance. Lin Tian finally stopped, turned around, and looked directly at Gobu Yue. 
Gobu Yue was a bit confused but answered seriously, “Although I haven’t known you for long, I think you are a very good goblin. There’s no better goblin in the world than you.” 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian suddenly pushed Gobu Yue against a tree in a forceful “kabe-don.” 
He then tore off her robe. 
“Boss, no, what are you doing?” 
Gobu Yue panicked, struggling to grab her robe, but she was too weak compared to Lin Tian. 
In the dark, goblins had good vision without needing moonlight. 
He could clearly see Gobu Yue’s appearance. 
Unlike male goblins, she didn’t have an exaggeratedly large head or a particularly long nose. 
She only had sharp teeth and pointed ears, along with green skin. 
Her short pink hair, even shorter than shoulder-length, looked especially cute. 
Her eyes were actually golden, carrying a hint of shyness and panic. 
Her petite figure was like that of a toy doll. 
“Who knew goblins could look like this? Sorry, Gobu Yue! But we need to survive!” 
Lin Tian almost got lost in her appearance. 
Feeling embarrassed under his gaze, Gobu Yue shyly asked, “Boss, do I look strange?” 
Lin Tian’s eyes were dreamy as he stared deeply into her eyes, “No, you’re the most beautiful goblin girl I’ve ever seen. Your eyes have stars in them. Can you help me get stronger? I’ll leave a gift for you~” 
“Boss, what are you going to do? If there’s nothing important, I want to go to sleep.” 
Gobu Yue fidgeted, a blush appearing on her green cheeks. 
Lin Tian, ignoring any preliminaries, said, “Gobu Yue, it’s time for you, as my subordinate, to help your boss out. Are you ready?” 
“I… I might, maybe, probably not.” 
Gobu Yue stammered, her little heart starting to pound. 
Suddenly! 
Lin Tian pulled her into his embrace, feeling her warm breath. 
His eyes darted, looking very scared. 
She tried to speak but was silenced by Lin Tian’s kiss, unable to say a word, only able to weakly resist. 
When the power of the Goblin God’s Blessing activated, even a female goblin couldn’t resist. 
She was completely subdued. 
At dawn, Lin Tian carried the exhausted Gobu Yue back to the tribe. 
There were still important tasks to handle, like the iron ore in the furnace, which might burn out. 
Fortunately, the goblins he had taught weren’t entirely useless. They had already refined the iron ore multiple times, removing many impurities. 
It was nearly pure enough to make iron tools. 
He immediately began crafting an iron breastplate for Gobu Yue, to protect her chest and back. 
For a weapon, something smaller would suffice. 
The remaining iron spears were left for the other goblins to make. 
“Gobu Yue, still lying down? Come see if this fits.” 
After binding two iron plates with twine, Lin Tian took them to Gobu Yue. 
However, she was still lying in her grass nest, sleeping soundly but sweetly. 
Lin Tian shrugged helplessly. Since she was still asleep, he decided to check his own attributes. 
[Small Goblin: Lv7—(Max Lv14)<br/>
Race: Goblin<br/>
Profession: None<br/>
Title: Low-level Monster, Blasphemer, God’s Blessing, Potential God<br/>
Health: 40<br/>
Strength: 10<br/>
Defense: 9<br/>
Skill: Gene Devour<br/>
Equipment: None<br/>
Overall: 65] 
His attributes had significantly improved but were still far from enough. What did those titles mean? 
Unfortunately, he couldn’t view them through the system. 
Lin Tian frowned. Why had his level cap only increased by 7? 
It seemed mating with random wild boars, monkeys, or rabbits would have been better, as it could increase the cap by 10 levels. 
A female goblin, a legendary creature, should have offered more. It was baffling. 
“Seven levels, seven times, huh! I get it!” 
As he thought about it, a light bulb went off in Lin Tian’s head! 
He looked at the sleeping Gobu Yue with a wicked grin. 
“Boss, what are you doing again, wuuu…” 
Gobu Yue woke up groggily from her sleep. 
“As expected!” 
After finishing, Lin Tian’s eyes lit up. With a female goblin, each mating session increased his level cap by one, with no limit on the number of times! 
Other creatures had caps. 
For instance, with wild boars or monkeys, no matter how many times, the cap would only increase by 10 levels. 
With humans, such as human females or elves, the cap would increase by 20 levels, but their talent would greatly enhance his abilities. 
To further increase, he had to devour the flesh of powerful creatures. 
In simple terms, the females of each race were like level cap boosters for goblins, tools for getting stronger, while their flesh served as experience packs. 
Today. 
Lin Tian increased his level cap to twenty-five! 
Completely exhausted, he collapsed into a deep sleep. This wasn’t his limit, but the limit of his goblin body. 
When he woke up, he found himself being lifted high by a crowd of goblins. 
“Brother Lin! Brother Lin!” 
All around were cheers and celebrations. 
Lin Tian quickly realized that all the iron spears had been completed. 
“Brother Lin, we finished making the iron weapons. Can we attack the elves now?” 
One goblin asked excitedly. 
Lin Tian shook his head, “We need to cut down some long, slender logs. The more, the better. Everyone, move out!” 
The spearheads were ready, but they still needed spear shafts. 
The key was to get all the goblins out. 
Once the goblins left for the forest, Lin Tian turned his gaze to the gray-black hut. 
If the goblins were around, it would be impossible to attack the Goblin Priest. 
Because he possessed the Summon skill, which could control these goblins. 
“With 50 Life Points, I can exchange for 50 experience pills. But I wonder if that will be enough to max out my level.” 
Lin Tian exchanged all the points in one go. 
He immediately maxed out his level and still had twenty experience pills left. He then realized that fewer points were needed for lower levels and more for higher levels. 
He checked his attribute panel. 
Now, his health had reached 120, strength 20, defense 11, and overall 150. 
It was far inferior to humans or magical beasts. 
In total, he was still weaker than the Goblin Priest, who had already evolved into a Big Goblin variant. 
“Damn, goblins are so weak. I’ll have to rely on equipment.” 
Lin Tian donned the makeshift plate armor and the crescent moon blade he had crafted. 
His strength instantly increased to fifty, and his defense reached an impressive 30. His overall strength slightly surpassed the 200 of the Goblin Priest. 
Killing him was now entirely possible. 
At that moment, unexpectedly, the Goblin Priest himself came out, coldly asking, “Where did the other goblins go?” 
“Boss, I sent them to gather materials for making iron tools.” 
Lin Tian replied with a flattering look. 
The Goblin Priest narrowed his eyes slightly and just gave a hum before preparing to return. 
Lin Tian then called out, “Boss, I just made this iron tool. Take a look.” 
“Oh? Bring it here.” 
The Goblin Priest showed interest and stopped. 
Lin Tian was planning to play the role of Jing Ke trying to assassinate the Qin Emperor! 
As long as he could catch the old guy by surprise, his chances of success were a hundred percent. 
The priest was old and frail, with very low health. Two or three strikes could actually kill him. 
He slowly approached with the crescent moon blade. 
The Goblin Priest’s eyes were fixed on the scythe. Just as Lin Tian was a step away, the priest suddenly spoke. 
“Put the scythe on the ground. I’ll take it myself.” 
Lin Tian’s heart skipped a beat! 
This old guy was wary to such an extent? He must have suspected Lin Tian’s intelligence was too high, hence his caution. 
Other goblins wouldn’t even be believed capable of plotting such treachery. 
The situation became more severe. To avoid suspicion, Lin Tian reluctantly placed the crescent moon blade on the ground.
