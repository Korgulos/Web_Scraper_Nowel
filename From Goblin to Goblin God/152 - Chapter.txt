Chapter 152: The Greatest Saint: Joan of Arc! 
“Big Sis… It seems I won’t be able to help you kill this guy. But I believe you’ll be able to finish him off yourself later!” 
Osius’s entire body was charred black, barely holding on. He was staggering. 
The others were not in much better shape, some even worse. Their strongest had only a little over 9000 combat power, while Landau, despite just being a noble, had reached 9900 under the Death Eye’s enhancement. 
Moreover, the Death Eye was like a high-output, fixed artillery. Trying to withstand it head-on without enough combat power would only lead to a pointless death. 
If they hadn’t been pressed for time, Osius and his team could have slowly worn him down, potentially even killing him without injury. 
But for people like them, they didn’t care about such things. 
“Kekeke! You want to kill me? I love watching you all fail to kill me, only to get killed yourselves! Fools! A bunch of fools marching to their death!” 
Landau laughed maniacally, pointing at the members of the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
Bzzz… 
Whoosh! 
Suddenly. 
A blinding white lightning bolt exploded in the sky! 
The brilliance it emitted even overshadowed the blood-red light of the Death Eye. 
It was as if a thunderclap had torn through the darkness. 
Buzz! 
The deafening explosion echoed above Landau’s head, leaving him dizzy and disoriented. 
His heart trembled as he quickly looked up, “Wh-what’s happening?!” 
Crack! 
The Death Eye was covered in countless cracks before it shattered! 
Scarlet energy scattered everywhere, and the entire eye turned to ash. 
Landau looked around in disbelief, “Who! Who the hell did this?!” 
At that moment, he began to panic. 
Osius glanced toward Lin Tian from afar. He had noticed that the attack had come from that direction. But after a moment’s thought, he dismissed the idea and refocused on the situation in front of him. “Heh, what can you do now?” 
Even though they were all severely injured, with so many of them, even a flurry of fists would be enough to beat him to death! 
The Dragon Slayer Guild members all rushed forward, too exhausted to use their skills, resorting instead to bare-knuckle brawling and biting! 
Their adrenaline surged, giving them unprecedented strength. 
Landau struggled with all his might but couldn’t resist, “Aaaaah! Stop! Stop biting me!” 
The sound of flesh tearing from the body, accompanied by his screams, echoed endlessly. 
Boom! 
At that moment, a massive body collapsed next to Osius and his group. 
It was Grugia, covered in wounds, forcibly reverting to his original form. 
Osius hurriedly checked on him, “He’s still breathing…” 
But he couldn’t find any joy in it. 
Turning around, he saw three men with bulging muscles and a strong, imposing presence walking toward them. 
Some had disdain on their faces; others were calm and unbothered. 
They were none other than the perfect Titan warriors who had also reverted to their original forms. 
‘Patrick.’ 
‘Bowers.’ 
‘Santuelan.’ 
These top fighters of the kingdom possessed 99% pure Titan genes. 
They could transform into giants at any moment, unleashing tremendous destructive power. 
Patrick, with a cigarette in his mouth, sneered, “Well, Grugia, that spot you fought so hard to win, how did you end up a failure? Your parents and kids all died for nothing, hahaha!” 
He was the one who had competed with Grugia for the spot, even plotting to kill his entire family. 
Later, because Grugia failed, he was chosen instead as an exception. 
And he became a perfect warrior. 
Grugia, heavily injured and supported by others, was furious yet powerless, his eyes bloodshot. “You!” 
“Shh, don’t get too worked up. I’m afraid you might just die like this. Otherwise, all the wealth you spent and your family’s deaths would be in vain.” 
Patrick continued to mock. 
The other two Titan warriors also joined in with loud laughter. 
Lin Tian watched from a distance. 
These guys had pure strength, no special skills, only the ability to Titanize. 
But their overall combat power was a staggering 10,001! 
And they weren’t even wearing any armor or wielding weapons. 
No wonder Osius and the others didn’t dare to act recklessly or even make a sound. 
Because they knew, their death was imminent… 
“K-kill them…” 
At this moment, a voice came from the ground, from a person riddled with holes and drenched in blood. 
It was Landau. 
The intense pain made his body tremble uncontrollably. His nerves were constantly searching for the missing muscles, and the remaining few threads of red muscle on his wounds twitched. 
If it were anyone else, they would have longed for death to escape the pain. 
But he still wanted to live! He wanted to see the Dragon Slayer Guild wiped out with his own eyes! 
Osius and the others didn’t bother with that guy for now. After all, even if he survived, he would be a cripple forever. 
Upon hearing Landau’s order, Patrick frowned. “Useless trash, are you giving us orders?” 
Landau opened his mouth, revealing two rows of teeth where his lips used to be, but he couldn’t speak. 
Patrick glanced around casually. “I seem to recall that His Majesty said anyone threatening the safety of the royal city can be killed on the spot, right? These guys are all dangerous, aren’t they?” 
Osius’s lips twitched. He didn’t know what to do next, but a deep sense of satisfaction filled his heart. At least they had avenged the One-Eyed Owl. The rest didn’t matter. Even if they died at their hands, the One-Eyed Owl would come for revenge later. Not one of them would escape. 
“Hey! Want to survive, you piece of trash?” Patrick flicked the cigarette butt he was holding at Grugia’s forehead. 
He had no intention of sparing them. He was just toying with them. 
Grugia was on the verge of losing consciousness, unable to speak. 
Osius prepared to make a desperate stand. Even if he couldn’t win, he wanted to die fighting. 
“This is getting boring. Kill them all,” Patrick said with a roll of his eyes, ready to strike. 
Just as tension mounted on both sides, the sound of hoofbeats echoed from the street corner. 
A group of soldiers in armor approached, led by a young woman riding a white horse. She was dignified, elegant, and exuded a holy aura. 
She was full of heroic spirit, clean and sharp. Though she looked under twenty, she had the presence of a leader—no, she was a leader. 
Seeing this group, even the arrogant and reckless Patrick quickly performed a salute. “Greetings, Your Majesty, the Great Joan of Arc…” 
“What’s going on here? I just arrived, and it’s already so lively?” asked the young woman, who was none other than the legendary Saint Joan of Arc. 
She had led an uprising of oppressed slaves, toppling one of the super empires, the ‘Solon Dynasty,’ and established a kingdom advocating freedom and equality. 
But it wasn’t just her beauty that captivated people; her brilliance lay elsewhere. She was hailed as the youngest and greatest military strategist, politician, and thinker, and, of course, a queen. 
Though not the youngest ruler—some puppet states had children as young as a few years old as kings—in terms of military and political acumen, no super empire dared to underestimate her. At a young age, she could sit at the same table with the kings of great empires, conversing as an equal. 
She was a living legend. 
“Welcome to Twilight City, Your Majesty, the Great Joan of Arc!” 
At that moment, a chariot blazing with heat waves and the sound of clashing steel approached from the sky. 
Yes, this chariot was flying, with scorching flames spewing from its rear—a world-class magical artifact. 
The person who arrived was the king of the War Empire, ‘Alexander.’ 
He was dressed in a heavy royal robe, a crown on his head shining brilliantly in the light of dusk. Despite appearing in his fifties or sixties, he was full of enthusiasm. 
Stepping down from the chariot, he extended his hand. “Your Majesty Joan of Arc, I apologize for inviting you here only to have you encounter such incidents.” 
Joan of Arc gracefully extended her alabaster arm as she dismounted her horse, her curiosity piqued. “Can you explain? How could something like this happen in Twilight City?” 
Alexander cast a cold glance at Patrick. “What’s going on?” 
“I-I’m not entirely sure,” Patrick replied with his head lowered, respectful like a child caught in a misdeed. 
At that moment, Alexander noticed the weakened Grugia. “Hmm? I don’t recall us provoking the Dragon Slayer Guild.” 
As he looked around at the speechless group, growing increasingly irritated, Lin Tian’s voice broke the silence. “Hahaha, greetings, Your Majesty. Here’s what happened: our Dragon Slayer Guild has no grudge against the empire, but Duke Landau plotted to kill our guild leader, which led to this incident.” 
Hearing this, Alexander’s expression darkened, but he quickly grasped the situation. Of course, he would never have ordered Landau to do such a thing. As the king of a great empire, he wasn’t so base and shameless. 
“My apologies, Your Majesty Joan of Arc. It seems you’ve been made to witness a farce. Guards, arrest all of them…” 
Before he could finish, Joan of Arc’s deep, golden eyes filled with compassion. “Your Majesty Alexander, since the Dragon Slayer Guild was only seeking justice, let’s consider the matter resolved.” 
She valued freedom and equality, always acting according to principles of reason and emotion. The Dragon Slayer Guild had been wronged by the Landau family; it was only right for them to seek revenge. Now that the revenge had been exacted, the matter should be put to rest. 
“Hmm… Since Your Majesty Joan of Arc says so, then you may all disperse,” Alexander said, pausing only slightly before speaking cheerfully. 
He had gone to great lengths to invite Joan of Arc for a collaboration, so naturally, he needed to show some respect. 
Hearing this, Osius and his team were left a bit bewildered, unable to fully comprehend what had just happened. 
Could they really leave here alive? 
Alexander had arrived, after all. Causing such a commotion on his turf and even wiping out a major noble family—this was no small matter. 
Lin Tian gave a quick glance to his comrades. “What are you standing around for? Let’s go!” 
If he hadn’t been quick-witted, realizing that Joan of Arc might be a chance for salvation and stepping forward to explain the situation, they might have all been executed with a single order. Even with the name of the One-Eyed Owl, Alexander, as the king of such a vast empire, wouldn’t have hesitated to act. 
On the ground, the dying Landau’s eyes were filled with rage, bulging as if they were about to pop out of their sockets. He was unwilling to accept this! 
The Dragon Slayer Guild was just going to walk away like that? Did that mean his family’s deaths were for nothing? And he himself wouldn’t live much longer. But he didn’t even have the strength left to speak. 
“Thank you, Your Majesty Joan of Arc! I will never forget your great kindness. I wonder if there’s a way to contact you so I can repay you in the future.” 
Lin Tian bowed deeply, attempting to mimic a human gesture by kneeling on one knee, and took hold of her fair arm. He kissed it lightly, feeling as if a flood of warmth and peace washed over his mind. He thought, “Ah… what a delightful taste.” 
Seeing that Lin Tian was holding on a bit too long, Joan of Arc felt a bit awkward. “Um, sir, there’s no need for repayment. It was simply the right thing to do.” 
“Well then, until we meet again.” 
Only then did Lin Tian rise, quickly gathering Osius and the others to leave.
