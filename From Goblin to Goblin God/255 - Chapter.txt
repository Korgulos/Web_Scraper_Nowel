Chapter 255: Blood Spear, The Final Requiem! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Sure. When comparing world-class magical artifacts, adding only a single refining material is enough. But for a Full Moon-class artifact, you’d need to incorporate eighteen different materials, each with unique properties that don’t clash with one another.” 
“Take this Blood Spear, for example,” Bill explained meticulously. “I combined materials like giant rhino horn, dragon scales, Garuda feathers, island turtle shell, and other resilient components…” 
Lin Tian didn’t care much about these forging techniques. After all, he now owned the entire dwarven clan. 
No need to learn it himself. 
Instead, he asked, “What I mean is, what’s the main difference between the power of Full Moon-class artifacts and world-class ones?” 
Hearing this, Bill continued his explanation. “World-class artifacts hold only three magical effects, whereas Full Moon-class can carry seven. Plus, as a weapon, the materials used are significantly tougher.” 
“Seven magical effects? What does this Blood Spear possess?” Lin Tian pressed on. 
Bill picked up the Blood Spear and explained, “For a proper demonstration, we’d need a real battlefield. But here’s the gist: it can store the blood of your enemies to heal your wounds without shortening your lifespan.  
Plus, since your blood weakens enemies, every strike allows your blood to enter their bodies through the spear. You can control the amount, just like a snake injecting venom.  
And most importantly, anyone struck by the Blood Spear suffers a wound that can’t heal and continues bleeding—even healing magic is powerless against it. It’s true it no longer summons lightning attacks, but honestly, in combat, that feature was losing its effectiveness.  
Besides these three magical abilities, it also has a remote control function. 
The remaining three abilities? They’re more ordinary, so we can ignore them.” 
Hearing this, Lin Tian felt reasonably satisfied, considering it was a weapon tailored just for him. 
He could now control a substantial dose of his cursed blood to inject into his foes. 
This would directly suppress any angelic awakening, forcing them into a state of final judgment. 
Last time, the angel Javier managed to activate her Ultimate Judgment, simply because the spear tip held only a trace of the cursed blood. 
That was nearly disastrous. 
“Damn, I don’t even know how to thank you. How are you holding up? If you’re up for it, I’ll let you choose a few consorts if you like!” Lin Tian remarked. 
But Bill didn’t seem particularly thrilled; instead, he looked a bit let down. “I… no, one’s enough for me.” 
Seeing his expression, Lin Tian added, “Hey, man, I get it! I didn’t want to wound your pride before, so I didn’t mention it. If it’s really an issue, I’ll help you get a new kidney later!” 
He said this— 
But then heard no response from Bill. 
Turning around, he saw Bill was already weeping uncontrollably. 
“Your Majesty Lin Tian, I really don’t know how to thank you! If possible, I’d like a donkey’s kidney because the one we raised back home managed seven female donkeys and still had energy to spare! Boohoo!” Bill, his eyes brimming with gratitude, spoke with deep emotion. 
For a moment, Lin Tian couldn’t help but chuckle. “Alright, alright. By the way, what about the Full Moon-class gear for the One-Eyed Owl?” 
A helmet, chest plate, boots, and knuckle dusters. 
Just these four pieces. 
Wiping his aged tears, Bill explained, “I named this armor the Boiling Blood Armor. Given her love for fighting, it’s crafted with the core of the Devil’s Greatflower, so it lowers pain, enhances muscle strength, and boosts heart rate, among other effects. 
To what extent, you ask? Well, you’re probably aware of what happens to anyone under the Devil’s Greatflower’s influence. 
And even though it’s light armor, its design allows for effective blocking and defense. The defensive capability is exceptional—Blood Spear won’t be able to penetrate it if blocked. Only a direct strike could bypass it.” 
Lin Tian nodded as he listened. 
He immediately understood. In essence, this light armor was a kind of power boost. 
Creatures affected by the Devil’s Greatflower entered a frenzied state, unleashing terrifying strength at 200% of their usual power. 
They couldn’t be killed without being completely dismembered. 
But its side effects were severe, as adrenaline stimulation often led to organ failure and shock. 
Thus, Lin Tian asked, “Given it’s made with the Devil’s Greatflower’s core, wouldn’t the side effects be too extreme?” 
Bill looked supremely confident. “I also incorporated bloodstone into it, which can heal organs after every battle without consuming lifespan.” 
Such a perfectly crafted weapon. 
Only dwarves could forge something so meticulous. 
Lin Tian was highly satisfied. “And the last piece—these knuckle dusters?” 
“You call it knuckle dusters, but I named it ‘The Final Requiem.’ With every strike, it shatters the enemy’s armor, breaks bones. The sound of each blow becomes their death knell! How’s that for a name?” Bill chuckled. 
To the people of this world—or dwarves, at least—a hint of dramatics was all too common. 
The earliest Spear of Zeus was actually named World-Ending Thunderbolt. 
The name “Spear of Zeus” was just for extra flair. 
After all, the title of King of the Gods carried its own weight. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but laugh. “Alright, then. The Final Requiem it is. Does it have seven magical effects as well?” 
Bill’s expression grew solemn. “This is a custom weapon, so it doesn’t necessarily have seven effects. Based on the One-Eyed Owl’s combat style, I focused on enhancing the durability of ‘The Final Requiem,’ leaving it with only one magical effect. But you might not believe it when you hear what it does. 
“Every third attack releases the combined power of the previous two strikes! Simple and brutal!” 
Before Lin Tian could even react, a shout of sheer excitement erupted from the doorway. “What!!! The combined power of the previous two attacks?! How is that even possible? This is incredible!” 
In an instant, the One-Eyed Owl strode into the room, her gaze locked on the pair of pitch-black knuckle dusters, streaked with a glimmering starlight. 
Holding them with palpable excitement, she exclaimed, “The feel of these is perfect! I have to test them out right away!” 
… 
Outside, on an open field by the lake. 
Staring at a massive boulder over ten meters tall, the One-Eyed Owl frowned, sensing it still wasn’t enough of a challenge. “Is there anything bigger?” 
“That’s pure azure stone,” Bill said seriously. “It’s one of the hardest rocks around. Breaking it would be like taking down a living Demon King!” 
With this, the One-Eyed Owl’s interest piqued. “Alright, let’s give it a try!” 
She took her place in front of the towering stone wall. 
With a deep breath— 
It felt as if she’d drawn every bit of air from the surroundings, creating a striking sense of vacuum pressure! 
What Lin Tian expected to be a moment of build-up was over in an instant—her shadow blurred as she launched forward! 
An ear-splitting impact followed, the sound crashing through the air! 
Sparks even flew as the knuckle dusters scraped against the stone. 
Boom! 
Slam! 
The shockwave rippled out, sending waves in the lake towering several meters high, the entire surface churning and roiling. 
It was truly a breathtaking sight. 
But even such monstrous force left only a row of dents from the knuckle dusters on the stone surface—no shattering. 
The One-Eyed Owl smiled, satisfied. “Definitely tough. It’s got the feel of hitting armor—nice!” 
Boom! 
Another punch slammed into the rock. 
This time, a crack appeared across the stone, stretching from one side to the other. 
Yet, it still didn’t shatter. 
What was unmistakable, though, was the way the starlight around the knuckle dusters grew even denser, seeming to gain a spark of life with each strike. 
Now the starlight danced and pulsed around her fists, vivid and alive. 
Finally, the One-Eyed Owl sprang lightly into the air, aiming her third strike at the center of the boulder, and punched down hard! 
A raging wind erupted, ripping nearby trees from their roots! 
Tidal waves rose and crashed across the lake, reaching massive heights. 
In an instant, the boulder fractured and exploded into rubble! 
The explosive sound almost shattered eardrums. 
The One-Eyed Owl looked utterly thrilled. “These knuckle dusters are made for me. I’m dying to find an opponent who can take me on… So, kid, when are we attacking the Demigod Empire?” 
… 
Happy new year guys!
