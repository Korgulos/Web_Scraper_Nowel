Chapter 102: The Unexpected Path 
TL: Sungmin 
Upon seeing this guy’s attributes, Lin Tian immediately understood why Veronica’s combat power was so high. 
She had directly summoned two level 100 monsters. 
How could anyone fight against that? 
But what was this Black Goat Spawn? 
Someone’s child? 
It was so large and had such high attributes. 
Unfortunately, apart from its high health, it didn’t have anything particularly special. 
Still, it was enough to be considered a super soldier. 
With these two monsters assisting, they wouldn’t be crushed one-sidedly. 
“The guys from the Lionheart Empire are yours to handle. I’ll deal with the people from the Church,” Veronica said, then left with Rebecca and the Corpse Pope. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but sigh, “Is this the difference in strength?” 
He then looked at his current attributes.

Although world-class items wouldn’t increase attributes, they would enhance overall combat power. 
In other words, Lin Tian’s high combat power was achieved through world-class and half-moon-class magical items. 
Actually, having too many magical items wasn’t useful. 
During a fight, one could only control one or two world-class magical items effectively. 
It was better to focus on mastering the use of one, to exert maximum power. 
Currently, Lin Tian’s proficiency with the Spear of Zeus was too low; otherwise, his combat power could be higher. 
He mainly used it as a javelin or for electro-fishing. 
“Boss, someone from the Lionheart Empire is approaching us!” 
At this moment, several goblin scouts hurried over to report. 
Lin Tian narrowed his eyes, nodded, and activated the Call skill, summoning creatures from the entire enchanted forest. 
Unfortunately, due to the development of the goblin army, many monsters had been eaten. 
Only around twenty thousand remained, with over a thousand being fifth-tier or higher, three hundred sixth-tier, ten seventh-tier, and one eighth-tier. 
Despite being low-intelligence species, there were high-intelligence high-tier monsters among them. 
But those didn’t need to join the fight; the outcome didn’t affect them. 
Even if the Great Tomb lost, the Church had agreed not to interfere as long as they didn’t harm anyone. 
At this time, three empire scouts had already reached the cliff above the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
Seeing the vast number of goblins, various monsters, and those two terrifying aberrant creatures below, they were stunned. 
“What the hell are those things?!” 
“So many goblins?! His Majesty underestimated them!” 
“Luckily, we have a hundred thousand fully armored soldiers; otherwise, we’d be in danger!” 
The scouts were dumbfounded, especially when they saw the two Black Goat Spawn, feeling a strong physical and psychological discomfort. 
That was the aberrants’ innate ability, which would decrease one’s sanity. 
Sanity, also known as mental strength, would deteriorate with prolonged observation. 
Commonly referred to as unspeakable entities. 
Just as the scouts were in shock, a group of goblins surrounded them. Gobu Tian grabbed one and flew down. 
“Boss! Got them!” 
Lin Tian’s face turned cold, and he asked, “Do you have no fear of death?” 
The scout forced himself to remain calm, not showing any sign of fear, for he was there to declare war. 
If his spirit was weak, it would boost the enemy’s morale. 
Clearing his throat, he raised his voice, “Monsters! I represent the entire Lionheart Empire to declare war on you! A battle to the death outside the Great Tomb!” 
He handed over the declaration of war. 
“Quite a bit of spirit. Good! I accept your challenge.” 
Lin Tian stared at him with a strange expression. 
The scout inexplicably felt a surge of fear in his heart, staggering slightly but staying firm. 
He had already resolved not to return alive before coming. 
“Splurt.” 
Suddenly, bloody chunks fell from the sky. 
They were the blood and flesh of his companions. 
The eyes on the head were still wide open, with an expression of pain and ferocity, staring at him. 
Finally, the scout couldn’t hold it together, stepped back in fear, but tripped over Gobu Shan. 
Falling on him. 
Seeing Gobu Shan’s twisted, sinister face and the terrifyingly angled smile at the corner of his mouth. 
Gobu Shan, in the gentlest voice he could muster, said, “You touched me there… you must take responsibility, hehe.” 
The scout nearly fainted from fear. “What are you doing? Let me go, I beg you. I need to inform them of your response.” 
Suddenly, he saw a familiar figure. 
Golden hair, a side profile that was still so holy and beautiful, clean and moving like a white lotus. 
A familiar sense of security surged into his heart. 
It was Alicenia. 
But then he realized, “Sword Saintess, why are you…” 
Hearing his voice, Alicenia walked over. Seeing him so frightened, she remained calm and just drew the Ominous Blade. 
“Sword Saintess, go back. His Majesty and everyone at the Church…” 
Before the scout could finish his sentence, his head was severed from his body. 
The Ominous Blade had a hint of blood on it, which it quickly absorbed. 
This was the power of the Darkspawn. When enough blood was stored, it would rebel. If one couldn’t suppress it, the Darkspawn would take over the body. If suppressed, one would gain the power of the Darkspawn. 
Alicenia said calmly, “Be free. You, like me, are all deceived by demons.” 
The duty of a soldier was also to protect the residents. 
The actions of those residents had made Alicenia hate them to the bone. 
“Are you ready?” Lin Tian came over and asked. 
Alicenia nodded, “We can march out anytime.” 
Lin Tian nodded and looked at Gobu Yue. “You’ve worked hard during this time. Leave the fighting to us. Hide well here.” 
“But boss, I…” 
Gobu Yue hesitated. She was level 80, but because she was busy handling the tribe’s affairs, she hadn’t improved her strength.  
Like Lin Tian, she seemed unable to evolve into a high-tier variant, possibly due to some connection with the gods, making her relatively weak. 
Lin Tian raised his hand to interrupt her. “Let’s go.” 
He left the young wyvern Xiao Huan and Gobu Yue together, so they could escape if there was danger. 
Lin Tian slowly walked into the mighty goblin army. 
Alicenia, Gobu Kuang, Gobu Tian, Gobu Shan, Goblin Slayer, Lia, and the others followed.  
They were the leaders of this army, the pillars of combat strength. 
Walking at the front, leading their fierce monsters and goblins, they were imposing. 
With world-class magical items, Gobu Kuang and the others had their combat power soaring to over 5,000, about to evolve into overlord variants, even reaching over 6,000. 
They were fully capable of fighting the empire and the church. 
As for Lin Tian, he used Abnormal Fusion to devour a big variant goblin, transforming into a big variant and following behind Alicenia and the others. 
He had a regular low-level goblin walk in front as his decoy. 
Using the leader’s control ability, he could manipulate the decoy’s every move and word perfectly, fooling the church bastards and avoiding concentrated attacks. 
Those guys hated him to the bone. 
If they focused their attacks on her, even Alicenia would die instantly. 
The army marched forward. 
The Black Goat Spawn charged ahead like a killing machine, knocking down large trees easily. 
Lin Tian had to clear the trees; otherwise, they would crush many low-level goblins. 
There was no other way. It was just a spawn with no consciousness. 
It needed to devour humans to maintain activity, or it would die within three days. 
Lin Tian realized he was wrong to let Veronica release these two creatures so soon. 
It was troubling. 
“Boss, what is that thing? It looks so disgusting, and it keeps knocking down trees,” Gobu Kuang asked, first addressing the low-level goblin in front, then realizing and turning back. 
Lin Tian quickly explained, “I’ve told you all not to stare at those two. They’re aberrant creatures, called Black Goat Spawns, unable to understand words.” 
Gobu Tian scratched his head. “Aberrant? Black Goat Spawn?” 
Suddenly, he seemed to think of something. “Since it’s a spawn, can we mate with it to produce offspring?” 
Everyone froze, looking at Gobu Kuang as if he were a genius. 
An unexpected path indeed. 
His thought process left them speechless. 
Gobu Tian flew up and smacked his head. “Stop thinking nonsense. We’re about to fight. Can you focus? You have thoughts about that thing? You’re worse than Gobu Shan.” 
“You also went to see it,” Gobu Kuang said, feeling wronged. 
Lin Tian thought for a moment, his eyes lighting up. Gobu Kuang’s idea seemed quite reasonable. 
He wasn’t a pure goblin after all. 
Why hadn’t he thought that everything could mate? 
The Black Goat Spawn could work too! 
The initial formation of a new life needed specific combinations, everyone knew that. 
So, the Black Goat Spawn could create a new life. 
“If a new life could really be created, wouldn’t I be the husband of the Flame Dragon Mother, legitimately?” 
Lin Tian’s eyes twitched. He decided to try. 
The Flame Dragon Mother was one of the seven great evil gods. 
Although a legend, with the Black Goat Spawn here, it might be true. 
Lin Tian withdrew to the back of the goblin army, sneaking close to the Black Goat Spawn. 
It was as big as a tall building. 
The aberrant’s innate skill made it increasingly uncomfortable to look at, driving people insane. 
Lin Tian couldn’t stand it either. 
He gritted his teeth, closed his eyes. 
And dealt with the matter. 
Better than losing all sanity.
