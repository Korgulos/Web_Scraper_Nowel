Chapter 63: The Sword Saintess Gives Birth, The Lion Emperor’s Wrath 
TL: Sungmin  
Lin Tian then surveyed the topography of the valley. 
It was nestled between two mountain cliffs, essentially at the base of a precipice. The concealment was indeed quite good. 
The valley’s area was relatively large, about one kilometer wide and approximately three kilometers long to the end of the mountains. 
It could easily accommodate a hundred thousand goblins. 
Furthermore, high cliffs on either side acted as natural safety walls, requiring only the front and back to be guarded. 
After planning out various areas, Lin Tian began to organize. 
Thousands of breeding tools were arranged in three batches within some crevice areas of the valley. 
These crevice areas were also vast, providing shelter from the wind and rain, while being hidden and safe. 
Then, he divided the living area, materials area, rest area, and so on, each clearly marked and notified. 
The rest. 
He left it to them to frantically reproduce. 
… 
Time flew by, and a month quickly passed. 
The events at Bright Town had spread nationwide, and Lin Tian’s raids on villages and towns along the way were well known. 
The news even reached other empires. 
This caused the Lionheart Emperor to lose all face. 
For such a large empire to be thrown into chaos by a goblin was indeed a disgrace. 
In the largest cathedral in the capital, also the headquarters of the Lionheart Empire’s Holy Church. 
It occupied a considerable area, with the central cathedral built entirely of white jade. A tall, sacred golden cross stood within, incredibly magnificent. 
Today was a very special day, and even the Lionheart Emperor, despite being troubled by the goblin situation, had to come personally. 
A middle-aged man in bronze-gold armor, draped in a red cloak, quickly walked toward the center of the cathedral. 
His face was sharply defined, with a bit of stubble and scars, his eyes fierce like a lion’s. 
No one dared to look directly at him. 
The golden, radiant crown on his head symbolized one thing. 
This nation, established amid a century of war and smoke. 
Their Lionheart Emperor, ‘Charles II.’ 
As he approached the cathedral, he found it surrounded by many people. 
They were nuns, monks, and Holy Guards. 
All were holding a cross, softly reciting the Bible, seemingly praying for someone. 
Seeing this, Charles II did not interrupt but waited until someone finished reciting before asking, “How is Alice?” 
To the church, even a monarch showed great respect. 
The monk’s face was grave, “She started giving birth ten minutes ago, she should be about to deliver.” 
He was talking about the Sword Saintess, Alicenia. 
After being taken away last time, she had been resting in the church, but unfortunately, she could not escape the fate of being seeded. 
Hearing this, Charles II’s teeth almost shattered from clenching. 
His whole body trembled, his fists cracking loudly! 
“Gob… lin!” 
Charles II spat out each word with hatred, his terrifying aura scaring everyone around. 
To Alicenia, Charles II was like a father. 
He also regarded Alicenia as his daughter. 
Now, her husband had become a goblin, and a forced one at that—who could tolerate this? 
Inside the tall white jade cathedral. 
A group of nuns and the current Holy Mother were busy. 
Under the statue of Jesus, a pale figure lay on the carpet. 
It was Alicenia, groaning in pain, drenched in sweat, her golden hair soaked, “It hurts, why does it hurt so much!” 
“Child, this is your first childbirth, it will definitely hurt, keep going.” 
The Holy Mother spoke gently, her eyes full of sympathy, almost in tears. 
Although the name Holy Mother sounded old, she looked only around thirty. 
Wearing a white robe with golden trim, she appeared pure and flawless, yet her full figure added a hint of seduction. 
Her gentle eyes made people want to lie in her arms and sleep peacefully. 
The Holy Mother was the highest authority over all nuns, second only to the Pope. 
She had a high status and was respected by many. 
At this moment, Alicenia felt she was about to faint from the pain, but in the last second, she felt something coming out. 
In that instant, she collapsed on the spot, panting heavily. 
Not only because it was her first childbirth, but also because her first time was with Lin Tian. 
Not having been stimulated multiple times, she was not spacious enough. 
When the sticky, green-skinned goblin was born, the nuns covered their mouths. 
They were so frightened they stepped back several paces. 
They could not believe this was the child of the Sword Saintess. 
Seeing this, the Holy Mother steeled her heart, intending to take the goblin away. 
“Slap!” 
Suddenly, she felt a tremendous force on her wrist. The exhausted Sword Saintess grabbed her hand, and coldly said, “Don’t touch him…” 
The Holy Mother was not frightened by the goblin, but by the Sword Saintess’s current state, feeling the killing intent in her eyes! 
They quickly and tactfully stepped back. 
The small goblin chirped and, unable to speak yet, managed to utter the sound ‘mama’ after a while. 
It even struggled to crawl towards the chest of the Sword Saintess. 
Alicenia slowly sat up, staring blankly at the tiny monster she had given birth to. 
The goblin infant, with its mouth full of sharp teeth, latched onto the feeding spot and began to suckle. 
However, Alicenia, experiencing breastfeeding for the first time, felt a sharp pain. She quickly retreated a few steps, panic-stricken, and asked, “What is he doing?” 
“This little one seems hungry. Imagine that, just born and already able to talk, and it knows where to find milk…”  
The Holy Mother spoke with a face full of lingering fear. 
Such a creature was truly inhuman. 
Hearing this, Alicenia cautiously held the baby in her hands, and despite her embarrassment, placed it on her chest. 
Watching this strange scene, one she had never experienced or understood, she was stunned for a long time. 
Suddenly, she let out a silly laugh, “Look at this little guy, he must be starving…” 
Seeing her reaction, the nuns were at a loss, feeling inexplicably sympathetic and pitiful. 
The Holy Mother took out a robe and draped it over Alicenia. 
Then she walked outside. 
Seeing her come out, Charles II hurriedly approached and asked, “How is she? Is she alright?” 
“Your Majesty, she has given birth safely, but… you should see for yourself.” 
The Holy Mother was momentarily at a loss for words. 
She had originally planned to take the goblin infant away while the Sword Saintess was weak and have someone else deal with it. 
Unexpectedly, Alicenia still had strength left. 
Charles II rushed inside, and when his concerned gaze fell upon the scene of the Sword Saintess breastfeeding. 
He stood there as if struck by lightning. 
Stunned in place, he did not recover for a long time. 
Various emotions flickered in his eyes as he feigned calmness and said, “Alicenia, may I see your… child?” 
“Your Majesty… he is still nursing. You can just look.” 
Alicenia did not look at the Lionheart Emperor; her eyes remained fixed on the goblin. 
Seeing her like this, Charles II felt he was on the verge of collapse! 
The Sword Saintess, the holy sword that protected the empire, not only gave birth to a goblin but also treated the goblin as her beloved child! 
He had imagined several possibilities. 
First, after giving birth, Alicenia would decisively kill the child. 
Second, she might avoid it, letting someone take the goblin infant away. 
Third, she would be terrified. 
But he had never thought she would treat the goblin as her child. 
Finally, Charles II could no longer endure it, his face darkened. “Give me that goblin infant… This is an order from the Emperor!”
