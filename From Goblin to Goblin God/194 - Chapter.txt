Chapter 194: A Night of Darkness and High Winds, Perfect for Killing and Arson 
TL: Sungmin 
Troy Arena. 
It was somewhat similar to Veronica’s Dark Realm, or perhaps akin to the world-class magic that Summoners and Necromancers could learn upon reaching level 100. 
The effect was almost identical to “Closing the Door and Beating the Dog.” 
A unique space was generated, continuously summoning creatures to attack. 
It was worth noting that in the battle at Laiyang Plains, even the old Pope had been nearly beaten to death after entering. 
Lin Tian had some self-awareness. 
It was impossible to face the Necromancer’s move head-on. 
He had to think of another way. 
“You want to play dirty with me, huh? Then don’t blame me for playing dirty back.” 
Looking into the distance, Lin Tian’s lips curled into a wicked smile that spread across his entire face. 
Then. 
He headed towards the dungeon. 
When the time came, he would simply have Rebecca help him charm Sara. 
The succubus’s charm ability wasn’t just effective on men—it worked on women too. 
Both men and women were biological creatures; the hormones in their brains couldn’t be that different. 
When Lin Tian appeared, Veronica lowered her head, filled with venomous resentment. “What exactly did you do to my Rebecca? Why won’t she pay attention to me anymore? And why does she keep calling your name?!” 
“Why should I answer you?” Lin Tian snapped coldly. 
This time, he wasn’t here for her and couldn’t be bothered to deal with her. 
Instead, he turned to Rebecca, “Dear, I need your help with something. Come with me.” 
“No problem, dear!” Rebecca responded excitedly, getting up to leave. 
She was no longer bound by chains. As long as Lin Tian stayed here, she wouldn’t leave. 
Just as they were about to walk out the door, Veronica’s voice echoed again, “Lord Lin Tian, if… if you return Rebecca to me, I’m willing to give up everything! My power might not be the strongest on this continent, but it’s not to be underestimated. If you ever need me, I’ll do whatever it takes to help you!” 
“Hmph, do you think I’ll believe that?” 
Lin Tian sneered, casting a contemptuous glance her way. 
This woman was no pushover—she looked pitiful, but who knew how cruel she really was inside? 
Her earlier act of pretending to beg for mercy had made that clear. 
However, Veronica continued, “No, Rebecca has been with me for hundreds of years. It’s only after losing her that I realized she’s more important than anything. Believe me or not, when you need me, I’ll prove it with my actions!” 
Upon hearing this. 
Lin Tian didn’t respond but instead left with Rebecca first. 
“When the time comes, just follow my plan. Do you understand?” Lin Tian said, his expression serious. 
Every step was crucial and could not go wrong. 
Rebecca nodded vigorously, “Don’t worry, dear, I won’t make any mistakes.” 
As night fell. 
The restlessness came not only from the insects and frogs chirping in the twilight. 
But also from the assassins of the three great empires. 
In a concealed room, Sara was repeatedly going over the plan with everyone. “I’ve already sent someone to invite the goblin over. Once he arrives, you’ll infiltrate the palace immediately. 
Then, the Holy Tree Empire people, your main target is the One-Eyed Owl and the Dragon Slayer Guild members. 
As for the rest of the Troy heroes, just take care of the goblin faction led by that girl, Alice. 
Zolt, the people of the Giant Elephant Empire, will assist as needed, dealing with any unexpected situations.” 
The objective was clear, and they were all ready to act. 
Everyone was brimming with confidence, their faces plastered with wicked grins. 
“Hmph, we’ve been holding back for days, and now we can finally kill those damned goblins, hahaha!” 
“I’ll skin that goblin and make boots out of it!” 
Zolt added, “Princess Sara, please make sure to leave me a whole corpse. I need to take it back to Persephia, in the hope it will heal her heart.” 
At this point, Luna furrowed her brows, filled with concern. “Princess Sara, are you sure you can handle that Goblin King on your own? Our investigations over this period show that there are many mysteries about him, and he’s very difficult to deal with.” 
“Tch, it’s just a goblin,” one of the Troy heroes scoffed. 
Though they had been humiliated recently, it was only because they didn’t want to blow their cover. Otherwise, they wouldn’t have stooped so low before a mere goblin. 
Luna continued, “From my investigation, this goblin was just a low-level goblin in a tribe, struggling to get enough to eat over a year ago. 
Yet, in such a short time, he’s built such a powerful empire. Do you really think he’s an ordinary goblin? And the way he deliberately made things difficult at the city gate, as if he knew we wouldn’t dare leave—it’s suspicious.” 
Upon hearing this, everyone fell into a brief silence. 
But Zolt, driven by his prejudice, retorted irritably, “You’re scared of a goblin? Hmph, how will you face the Giant Elephant Empire’s army? He just got lucky, picking up the victories from the Church and the Great Tomb, then using humans to produce soldiers.” 
Finally, Sara cut off the argument, “Enough. Thank you for your concern, Warrior Luna, but a goblin, in front of me, can only be toyed with and then killed. Even the One-Eyed Owl won’t walk out of the Troy Arena alive.” 
“The time is about right. Everyone, leave and start preparing. He should be arriving soon.” 
The group dispersed, each vanishing into the darkness. 
Not long after, there was a knock on the door. 
It was Lin Tian, who had come immediately after receiving the notification. 
The door opened. 
Under the moonlight, Sara’s high-bridged nose and deep, piercing eyes were revealed, causing Lin Tian’s lips to almost curl uncontrollably. 
Good things were meant for those who had a plan. 
The feeling of everything being under control, with no fear of any opponent, was simply exhilarating. 
Not only could he indulge in the pleasures with such an exotic beauty, but he could also eliminate that bitch Joan of Arc. 
Just one word—satisfying. 
Lin Tian said, “Miss Sara, why is the shop so dark? Where are the others?” 
“Your Majesty, you know why I called you here, so why ask? They’ve all gone to the succubus brothel in the city to amuse themselves, I suppose,” Sara replied, feigning softness. 
She quickly pulled Lin Tian inside and swiftly shut the door. 
One moment, she was like a delicate lotus in the moonlight, as if a mere touch could damage her petals. 
Now, she was like a tiger revealing its true nature in the darkness, ready to devour Lin Tian with bared fangs. 
Lin Tian, playing along, was led into a dimly lit room. 
Glancing at the setup in the room, Lin Tian couldn’t help but laugh, “You’re quite thoughtful, preparing such a big bed.” 
“Of course, Your Majesty. Now, close your eyes—I have a… surprise for you,” Sara said, tracing her slender fingers across Lin Tian’s chest. 
She could hardly wait! 
She could hardly wait to finish Lin Tian off. 
It only took a three-second casting time to pull him into the Troy Arena. 
Lin Tian coughed, excited, “Alright, alright. I never expected you, who always seem so cold and dignified, to have such a different side!” 
Just as he closed his eyes, Sara began to cast her spell, the light of a magic circle already starting to manifest. 
But then, there was a sudden, intense knocking at the door. 
Immediately, Lin Tian opened his eyes, and Sara hurriedly put away her ancient staff, her eyes darting nervously. 
“Who the hell is it, daring to ruin my good time? You, go out there and kill them right away! I’ll take responsibility!” Lin Tian cursed, handing Sara a dagger. 
Seeing this, Sara also felt a deep hatred for the person outside. “Alright!” 
Without delay, she took the dagger and headed toward the door. 
As she walked away, Lin Tian sneered disdainfully, thinking, What nerve she has, daring to face me alone. Who gave her the courage? 
However, if she hadn’t been a necromancer with weak individual combat strength, Lin Tian wouldn’t have dared to be alone with her. 
If she were like the One-Eyed Owl, she would have already killed him. 
At the door, Sara pushed it open, her gaze cold and resolute, ready to stab the person outside. 
But Rebecca quickly dodged the strike. 
Realizing she had missed, Sara looked up to see who it was, and in that brief moment of eye contact, Rebecca’s pupils turned into pink heart shapes, unleashing the powerful charm ability of the succubus! 
Sara was instantly hit with a full-force charm. 
However, while a succubus’s charm control was only effective on males, the charm ability was different—it could work on any gender. 
And that was enough. 
After successfully executing her move, Rebecca immediately fled as Lin Tian had instructed. 
But Sara hadn’t yet realized what had happened; she only felt as if a current had passed through her entire body, a very strange sensation. 
Her mood was restless and frantic. 
Her cheeks flushed with heat, and her thighs involuntarily pressed tightly together, her body writhing slightly. 
“What… what’s happening to me? Who was that just now? But they probably won’t dare come back, right? No matter, I need… I need to go kill that goblin first…” 
Sweat dripped from Sara’s face, her breath hot and heavy, the warmth almost visible in the air. 
She struggled to the door of the room. 
But she found Lin Tian already lying on the bed, waiting for her. 
And crucially, completely naked. 
With just one glance, Sara’s eyes locked onto something she shouldn’t have seen, as if they were perfectly matched! 
Her whole spirit was suddenly revitalized. 
Her lips dried up, craving the primal, wild nourishment of hormones. 
She completely forgot her mission to kill Lin Tian. 
Like a ravenous wolf, she pounced. 
Reenacting the events that had taken place when they first entered the city. 
Afterward, under the influence of Lin Tian’s goblin abilities, Sara completely lost the will to resist. 
So-called Troy heroes were now nothing more than livestock, with nothing in their minds except the word “desire.” 
Totally at the mercy of others. 
Then, Lin Tian summoned the mother of the Phantom Worms. 
He began to project. 
The Phantom Worm’s ability activated, blue light filling the room, dazzlingly bright. 
Its body acted like a vortex, recording all the images before it and transmitting them through the bug’s collective ability to the other Phantom Worms far away in the Troy Empire.
