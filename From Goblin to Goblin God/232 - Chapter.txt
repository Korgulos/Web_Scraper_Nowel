Chapter 232: The Kingdom of Heaven! Angels! 
TL: Sungmin  
[Life Simulation Activated] 
After a brutal and bloody battle, you finally took down the Zerg Queen, unleashing all your pent-up rage.  
You thought that you could now settle down, quickly grow stronger, and then lead your army with overwhelming power to break through the Uninhabited Zone and hunt down the demigods. 
However, just as your forces were reveling in the spoils of victory, something unexpected happened. 
The gates of Heaven opened. 
A beam of holy light in the sky grew increasingly bright—an archangel descended! 
Their overwhelming power was something you couldn’t resist. In an instant, you were killed. 
[This Life Simulation has ended. Simulation duration: fifteen minutes.] 
[Summary: An angel descended, carrying the wrath of judgment. Though not a true god, they possess the bloodline of a demigod, making them incredibly powerful.]

… 
Lin Tian’s expression turned grave as he stared at the simulation results, shock filling his eyes. 
“An angel?!” 
He hadn’t expected an angel to appear at such a critical moment!  
Worse, he had been instantly killed. 
The lack of additional information from the simulation meant that the angel had specifically targeted him! 
Lin Tian gathered his thoughts and looked down at his own attire. 
Armor, headgear, weaponry—all of it was dazzling, enough to make anyone mistake him for the Goblin King. 
He quickly stashed everything into his space ring, even hiding the ring itself. 
Perhaps this way, he might still have a chance to fight back! 
“Your Majesty, what’s wrong? You look… quite uneasy,” said Gegado, puzzled. 
Lin Tian gazed at the sky and gave loud orders to everyone, “Prepare for battle immediately! A true enemy is about to arrive—it’s an angel!” 
“What?!” 
“Did I hear that right? An angel? Where would an angel come from?” 
“Hey, hey! Look at that light in the sky! It’s kind of unusual… and it’s getting bigger!” 
The crowd was thrown into shock, all looking upwards. 
When they felt the increasingly strong divine power descending, they realized the gravity of the situation. 
Something was really coming down! 
… 
Above the clouds, in Heaven. 
It was a dreamlike world, entirely created by the Lord God.  
It looked like a massive castle, floating on the clouds. 
The castle’s primary colors were pure gold and white, utterly unsullied by dust.  
Majestic and awe-inspiring, it resembled a painting. 
In the castle’s grand plaza, a towering statue of Jesus, a thousand meters high, stood at the center. His arms were spread wide, like a cross, lifelike in detail. 
In the middle of this plaza, two angels, clad in shining silver armor and bearing pure white wings, were deep in conversation. 
Their wings were immaculate, without a single blemish—just like the angels themselves. 
They had golden hair, clear eyes, and skin as white as jade. 
Their silver armor accentuated their slender, graceful figures, making them incredibly captivating. 
“Javier, wait. We still haven’t received Lord Gabriel’s response yet. We shouldn’t descend to the mortal realm just yet,” one of the angels said worriedly. 
Her name was Loxie, and like the angel before her, Javier, she was one of the archangels. Among the angels, they both held considerable status. 
Ahead of them, at the far end of the plaza, stood a half-open golden gate—the entrance to the mortal realm from Heaven. 
Since Heaven was a created world, it didn’t float in the sky above the ground. To descend to the mortal realm, they needed to use magical gates for teleportation. 
Javier, looking anxious, turned around. Her large wings, along with a pair of smaller ones beneath them, fluttered slightly as she spoke solemnly, “There’s no time! The gate to the mortal world opens only once a year. Those monsters have all gathered in one place—this is the perfect opportunity to judge them all!” 
“But… we haven’t heard from the archangels yet…” Loxie still looked hesitant. 
Javier urged her, “Come with me, Loxie! Even if those monsters doubled their numbers, they wouldn’t stand a chance against the two of us. If we manage to judge them all, we might even advance to mid-tier angels! Then we’d have a better chance of igniting our divine sparks, no longer remaining mere demigods!” 
At this, Loxie couldn’t help but feel a bit tempted. 
Angels were not true gods with divine sparks—they were, at best, demigods with the bloodline of the divine. 
Among the lowest-ranking angels were “angels,” “archangels,” and “principalities.” 
Next came the mid-tier angels: “powers,” “virtues,” and “dominions.” 
Then, the high-tier angels: “thrones” and “cherubim.” 
The “thrones” were the pinnacle of melee warriors, while the “cherubim” represented supreme magical prowess. 
Finally, there were the true gods, the immortal twelve-winged Seraphim, who had ignited their divine sparks, such as Gabriel and Michael, the personal guards of the Lord God. 
“Well… while I also want to judge those monsters and avenge the faithful, the archangels haven’t given their reply yet… I don’t dare…” 
Loxie, looking timid, finally spoke, “But… I’m worried, Javier. I can’t bear the thought of anything happening to you… You’re my friend.” 
Javier almost felt like scolding her, frustrated beyond measure. “You’ve been this cowardly since you were a child. Are you really afraid of a bunch of monsters?” 
“But… the believer Douglas died at the hands of those monsters. His soul should’ve become an angel after death, but Lucifer stole him…” Loxie muttered, nervously fidgeting with her fingers like a child. 
The battle on the Laiyang Plains was still fresh in their minds. They had witnessed it all through Archangel Gabriel’s magic, yet the Gate of Heaven hadn’t been open at the time, so they couldn’t help. Only the Lord God could personally open the gate, but He resided in Eden, where no one could reach Him, leaving the angels powerless. 
Loxie added, “Please don’t go, Javier. I’m worried something will happen to you. I don’t want to lose you… You’re my friend.” 
Javier’s face darkened. “Enough. I can’t believe how scared you are. Goblins? Lowly monsters? You think I’d be in danger? We are angels! We wield the purest holy power, the bane of all monsters! And you’re actually afraid of them? You’re a disgrace to the archangels!” 
“You…!” Loxie’s golden eyes filled with a single blue tear, shining like a gem, as it slowly rolled down her cheek. She was deeply hurt. 
Javier turned abruptly, walking toward the glowing Gate of Heaven. “I have no use for a friend like you! Weak, fearful, and ignorant of an angel’s duty! You’re not fit to be an angel!” 
With those words, Javier stepped into the light of the gate. 
Her words pierced Loxie’s heart like a dagger.  
“Javier, how could you say that? We’re supposed to be friends…” 
“The duty of an angel is to judge those wicked monsters! Who cares if the archangels haven’t responded? Once I ascend to a mid-tier angel, you’ll no longer be my equal, let alone my friend! Farewell, Loxie!” 
As Javier’s voice faded, the Gate of Heaven slammed shut with a deafening echo. 
Loxie stood in the now empty plaza, clasping her hands together in prayer for Javier’s safety. Though she was an angel, she was still a soldier at heart—her mind no different from any ordinary person. 
… 
In the mortal realm. 
Lin Tian had ordered everyone to scatter, hiding himself among the goblin army to avoid being singled out by the approaching threat. 
He still didn’t know how many angels were coming. 
Running wasn’t an option; the only choice was to hope for an opportunity to strike back. 
Suddenly, a tremendous pressure descended from the sky! 
The holy light that had been faintly glowing exploded into a brilliant, blinding radiance, shattering the clouds and wrapping the entire world in a cloak of light. 
The brightness was so intense that the demi-humans and monsters couldn’t even open their eyes; everything in their vision went dark despite the overwhelming illumination. 
“What’s happening?!” 
“What… what is that thing? Is it really an angel?!” 
“I know! It’s a real angel, a divine being! Monsters like us aren’t even worthy to look at them! Damn it, what makes them so special?!” 
A chorus of complaints came from the monsters, but none of them could open their eyes. 
Though the world was bathed in light, the creatures’ sight was consumed by darkness. Such was the terror of an angel’s descent. 
However, not all were affected. The One-Eyed Owl and Alice, both non-monsters, could still see. Lin Tian, along with Gobu Kuang and others who had absorbed the strength of Trojan heroes, were also immune to the holy light’s suppression. 
At that moment, a grand and majestic background music filled the air, reminiscent of an orchestral performance from the medieval era, stirring awe in everyone who heard it. 
“No way… this angel comes with background music? This is bad…” Lin Tian muttered, feeling the situation grow even more dire. 
In the center of the holy light, a figure finally appeared. 
First, a pair of silver boots touched down, followed by long, white thighs, clad in a red skirt. Then came a slender waist and gleaming armor. Golden hair cascaded down her pale neck, framing her face—an expression of both divine purity and stern authority. 
In her hand was a silver holy sword, with a crimson cross emblazoned on it. 
Her massive divine wings flapped once, sending feathers flying in all directions, surrounding Javier with an aura of untouchable sacred might. 
A golden halo hovered above her head, symbolizing her heavenly status.  
Although she only bore a demigod’s bloodline, her holy power was a natural enemy of all monsters. Her confidence and strength were evident, her composure unshaken even before a massive army of brutal creatures below. 
“This is an angel? Compared to her, the Zerg Queen was nothing!” Gobu Kuang muttered in awe, his eyes glazed over with desire. “I… I want to trample her dignity, defile her purity!” 
In the sky, Javier’s eyebrows furrowed slightly as she overheard his thoughts, but she didn’t pay him much mind. Her gaze swept across the battlefield, filled with disdain and revulsion. 
The ground was stained crimson, littered with mountains of corpses and rivers of flesh. 
The stench of blood was overwhelming, enough to make anyone nauseous. 
Javier spoke slowly, each word cutting through the air like a blade, “Wretched… filthy… fallen… sinful… evil monsters! I am the messenger from Heaven! The Archangel of Judgment—Javier!” 
“Your very existence defiles this beautiful land! In the name of justice, I shall judge you all! Immediate execution!” 
“Do you have any last words?” 
Her voice resonated like the gavel of a judge striking the bench, silencing the world in an instant. It was as if she alone was the ruler of this realm. 
Her words echoed far and wide, thundering through the ears and into the very souls of everyone present.
