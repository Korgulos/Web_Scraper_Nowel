Chapter 19: Attacking the Bloodfang Tribe 
TL: Sungmin 
“Whoosh!” 
A powerful gust of wind rose, directly shooting out a beam of golden light, cutting down the big tree outside the tribe. 
Lin Tian sensed something was wrong; this must have been a Holy Light Impact. 
Through the system, he could see Ifreya’s attribute panel and skills, so he was somewhat familiar with them. 
[Ifreya: Lv38<br/>
Race: Human<br/>
Profession: Holy Nun<br/>
Title: God’s Servant, Holy Body, Monster Hunter, Hero, …<br/>

Overall: 500] 
Because she was a healer, her strength wasn’t particularly high, but with Holy-type skills, she could still take on several big goblins alone when at full strength. 
However, now she was essentially a loyal dog to the goblins. 
At this moment, Lin Tian flipped to the page with Holy Bible Cage. 
Looking at the strange text on it, Ifreya involuntarily began to chant. 
Resonating with the magic book, a fist-sized golden halo flew out from the book. 
It transformed into a cross shape, embedding itself firmly into the ground. 
“That’s more like it.” 
Lin Tian smiled with satisfaction. With this move, dealing with that Giant Hammer Goblin shouldn’t be a problem. 
But before that, he needed to collect a large amount of paralyzing toxin. 
After imprisoning him, just forcefully administer it until his resistance couldn’t hold out. 
At this moment. 
Gobu Kuang and the others had lost interest. 
Loder finally had a chance to catch his breath, feeling worse than death! 
If he weren’t waiting for the Sword Saintess and the imperial family to rescue him, he would have bitten his tongue and killed himself already. 
“Hmm? Ifreya, have you recovered? Quickly kill that goblin! Use magic to heal my body! Hurry!” 
Loder almost shouted, trembling all over, his eyes wide open and bloodshot! 
But Ifreya only glanced at him, as if she didn’t recognize him, then curled up by Lin Tian’s feet, her fair and beautiful body starting to sleep. 
“What, what is going on!” 
Loder’s breath trembled, unable to believe the scene before him. 
Ifreya, a holy nun, had actually become a goblin’s dog?! 
It was simply absurd! 
Lin Tian looked at him and sneered, “What else? She has willingly submitted to me, and has become my dog.” 
“You’re seeking death!!!” 
“Do you know what you’ve done? Ifreya is the daughter of the Holy Church’s bishop! Chosen to serve God! The child of the Holy Mother! You have no idea what you’ve done!!!” 
“The wrath of the Holy Church! How can a mere goblin bear it? Even the Lionheart Empire must show respect to the church, and you dare to do this?! Hahaha!” 
Loder didn’t know whether to laugh or be angry. 
Ifreya’s status was even higher than his, otherwise, he would have taken action long ago. But he only dared to pursue her, not to be forceful. 
Because she represented the gods. 
If killed by a goblin, it wouldn’t matter much; it would just be a conflict between humans and monsters. 
Quite normal. 
Even if she was defiled by goblins, it could be understood, after all, goblins were goblins. 
But now, a goblin had tamed God’s servant into his personal item, obedient and docile. 
This was provoking the gods, provoking God! 
This was the prelude to a war between monsters and gods! 
The church would never let this go. The Lionheart Empire, and even this continent, would be turned upside down! 
“Hahaha, your actions will undoubtedly lead to the complete extinction of goblins from this world!” 
Loder laughed again and said. 
Lin Tian roughly understood, “Why can’t goblins have her? God is a god, don’t goblins have gods too?” 
“Pah! A lowly monster like you dare compare with the church’s gods? Your existence is just to be slaughtered!” Loder spat fiercely, agitated. 
Lin Tian nodded slowly, “I see. Well then, Gobu Kuang, are you all scared? Can’t do it? Why is this guy idle.” 
“Huh? Boss, don’t slander me!” 
With that, Gobu Kuang and the others got back to work. 
Loder was shaking with anger and fear, “Beasts! Damn beasts! Aaaahhhh!” 
… 
When things were settled, Lin Tian began to gather the goblins and prepare their weapons; it was time to take on the Bloodfang Tribe. 
He announced, “This time, all the other goblins can be slaughtered, but their leader must be captured alive. Now, start collecting as much toxin as possible and fill these iron barrels.” 
Fortunately, with the iron-smelting process, iron barrels could be made. 
In the end, they collected over ten barrels of paralyzing toxin. 
“Let’s go, to the Bloodfang Tribe.” 
At This Moment, Inside the Bloodfang Tribe 
“Boss, we’ve cleared out all the surrounding goblin tribes and caves.” A goblin priest reported. 
The Giant Hammer Goblin nodded in satisfaction. “Very good. This way, our Bloodfang Tribe can dominate the enchanted forest to the west! Hahaha!” 
“However, there is still a relatively large tribe to the south. But it’s no big deal; when we checked them out recently, they were all ordinary goblins, not even a single big one.” 
Although the priest said this, his expression was somewhat complicated. 
The Giant Hammer Goblin dismissed it, “A small tribe like that can be wiped out by just two big ones. No need to worry.” 
“But I discovered they have a lot of ironware, and they even keep elves!” 
The priest couldn’t help but raise his voice in surprise and confusion. 
Immediately, the Giant Hammer Goblin sat up. “Elves? Did they take down the northern elf tribe?” 
“It seems so. Therefore, we must deal with them carefully. We should find an opportunity to raid and destroy their tribe, and seize the elves.” The priest sneered. 
Goblins would also guard against each other; it was better to eliminate rivals early to prevent them from growing stronger. 
The Giant Hammer Goblin pondered for a moment. “Alright, we’ll go later.” 
“Boss! There’s a goblin outside who wants to talk to us!” 
Suddenly, a shout broke the tranquility of the Bloodfang Tribe. 
The visitor outside was Lin Tian. 
The Giant Hammer Goblin stormed out, wielding his massive hammer. 
He sneered, “Hmm? A low-level goblin? Just kill it.” 
“Bloodfang leader, I know you’re a hero-tier goblin, with intelligence close to that of a human, so I’ve come to talk to you.” Lin Tian said. 
The Bloodfang leader was slightly taken aback. “You? A mutant variant?” 
He could sense that Lin Tian was definitely not an ordinary goblin, hence the assumption. 
“No, no, I’m just a bit smarter. Besides, I’m the leader of the Tian Kuang Tribe to the south, the one you mentioned that keeps elves.” Lin Tian squinted his eyes slightly as he spoke. 
Upon hearing this, the Giant Hammer Goblin burst into laughter. “Priest, is this the southern tribe you said was dangerous to the Bloodfang Tribe? How could this weakling pose a threat to us? Hahaha!” 
For a moment, the goblin priest was speechless. 
When he went to investigate, they were indeed all low-level goblins. 
But he didn’t expect them to be so weak. 
“Bloodfang leader, I’m actually here to propose cooperation. If you join us, you can have elves and even humans to mate with. But the condition is that only you can join.” Lin Tian said seriously, staring directly at him. 
The Giant Hammer Goblin was stunned, then put down his bone hammer. His massive body, like a small mountain, approached Lin Tian. 
He reached out and grabbed Lin Tian. 
“Fool, I’ll kill you, and those elves will be mine!” 
He said, ready to crush Lin Tian. 
Goblins had no concept of not killing messengers; they would kill any they could. 
However, the next second, the Giant Hammer Goblin’s fingers were cleanly severed! 
Blood gushed out! 
“Argh! Damn it! Kill him!” The Giant Hammer Goblin roared, retreating in pain. 
With the command, all the goblins of the Bloodfang Tribe rushed out, but they were all naked and unarmored. 
Their weapons were merely stones and wooden clubs. 
“Boom! Boom! Boom!” 
In the next second, thunderous, rhythmic footsteps resounded from the dark forest! 
“What’s happening? Is a giant monster coming?” 
The goblins of the Bloodfang Tribe were terrified by the sound. 
But when they saw the approaching figures, true fear gripped them! 
It wasn’t just any giant monster; this was much worse! 
Dozens of goblin warriors marched in unison, clad in iron armor and wielding iron spears! 
They moved like an unstoppable army! 
“How can there be so many goblin warriors!” 
The Bloodfang priest was stunned. Whoever wanted to fight could go ahead; he turned to flee. 
But as he reached the edge of the grassland, a sharp blade pierced his chest! 
“Who?!” 
The Bloodfang priest roared in madness, baring his teeth to resist. 
One stab didn’t kill him. 
Then another blade stabbed into his forehead. 
The assailant was Gobu Tian, leading a group of goblin assassins. 
In the dark, they were almost invisible, even with goblins’ night vision. 
However, night stealth only worked at night, not during the day. 
And the duration of night stealth was only 30 seconds, used only at crucial moments. 
This was such a moment. 
With Gobu Tian’s command, all the goblin assassins entered stealth mode, infiltrating the Bloodfang Tribe. 
At this moment, the Giant Hammer Goblin was furious. “Damn it, what good are so many goblin warriors? I’ll smash them all!” 
He reached for his bone hammer again. 
As his fingers opened, a flash of cold light! 
His fingers were all severed! 
Now, with no fingers on either hand, he couldn’t hold the hammer, greatly reducing his strength. 
“Damn it! What is this?! My hands! I can’t lift the hammer! I can’t lift the hammer!” 
The Giant Hammer Goblin raged, flailing his fists wildly. 
Seeing this, Gobu Tian shouted, “The boss’s task is done, retreat!” 
Goblin assassins were fragile; a single punch could kill them, so they retreated immediately. 
Outside the tribe, the well-equipped goblin warriors were fighting fiercely. 
The small goblins charging at them were easily slaughtered. 
Three hundred goblins couldn’t withstand them. 
Even the goblin warriors of the Bloodfang Tribe had only half the attributes of Lin Tian’s warriors. 
They were easily killed. 
Soon, only the enraged Giant Hammer Goblin remained. 
“Master! Master!” 
At this moment, Lin Tian led Ifreya forward, commanding, “Use Holy Bible Cage to trap him.” 
“Yes, master!” 
Immediately, Ifreya began chanting the Bible, the magic book flipping on its own. 
A light orb transformed into a cross, piercing through the Giant Hammer Goblin’s body! 
Trapping him in place, unable to move. 
However, it seemed it could only last for a dozen seconds. 
Seizing this opportunity, Lin Tian ordered, “Where’s the stuff? Pour it in his mouth! Then use the toxin skill to bite him!” 
A group of goblin assassins appeared, swiftly pouring the collected toxin into the Giant Hammer Goblin’s mouth. 
Others bit him relentlessly. 
“Damn it! Damn it!” 
The Giant Hammer Goblin struggled with all his might, finally breaking free from the cage, flinging several goblin warriors away. 
His strength was immense. 
“Everyone back off!” Lin Tian quickly ordered. 
The Giant Hammer Goblin’s hateful eyes locked onto Lin Tian, charging at him! 
Ifreya prepared to use magic, but was stopped. “It’s okay, my good dog.” 
“Boom!” 
A cloud of dust rose. 
The Giant Hammer Goblin fell before Lin Tian, completely paralyzed.
