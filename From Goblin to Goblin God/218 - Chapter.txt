Chapter 218: The Glory of the Trojans!! Unfazed Even if Outmatched! 
TL: Sungmin  
Everyone immediately sprang into action. 
They had become calm and composed. After all, this was no longer a big deal. The real spectacle lay in preparing to leave the wilderness. 
Perhaps, for those outside the wilderness, it was hard to imagine that any creatures were still alive within it. 
Lin Tian decided to give them a huge surprise. 
So, it was important to develop properly first. 
At this moment. 
Sara couldn’t wait any longer and offered herself, saying, “Your Majesty, thank you! Thank you for fulfilling your promise! Right now, this is all I can offer. Come, I will do everything I can to make you happy!” 
Seeing her eager and grateful expression. 
Lin Tian declined, saying, “Forget it. Just remember to remain my puppet when the time comes. I’m not in the mood right now.” 
He had just been tormented by the One-Eyed Owl for several days. 
He had no interest whatsoever. 
However, supporting Sara had always been part of the plan, and he wasn’t worried about them betraying him. 
If they did, he would simply wipe them all out. 
Their survival was purely dependent on their own awareness. 
At the Great Tomb. 
The dragons quickly began to gather, arriving at the royal city to await their deployment. 
Unlike before, there was now a new dragon among them, one whose entire body shone like dazzling crystal! 
It was none other than the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother. 
Though she was still under 500 meters long, her combat power had already surpassed ten thousand, putting her on par with the Flame Dragon Mother! 
Such was the power of the Crystal Dragon. 
“You! How many more miracles are you going to create?! I heard you even killed a demigod!” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, now in a stunning humanoid form, said. 
She wore a glistening crystal gown, her figure slim and sensual. 
Lin Tian responded calmly, “If they provoke me, why wouldn’t I kill them? But I must say, your growth is impressive as well.” 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother giggled, “Yes! I have you to thank for that. Want me to repay you?” 
Seeing her playful gestures. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but smile wryly, “Ahem, forget it. Don’t dragons only think about that kind of thing during mating season? How come you’re…” 
“Tch! Do you think I want to? You rascal. Little Black, never marry a man like your father in the future. First, he’s unfaithful, and second, he makes enemies everywhere. One day, he’ll get killed without even knowing how it happened.” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother said with a huff. 
Little Black scratched her head in confusion. For her, it would take several decades, if not centuries, to mature. 
At this moment. 
Master Bill, Queen Adele, and a large number of dwarves all arrived at the royal city as well. 
“Your Majesty Lin Tian! Stirring things up again? This time, you better bring me along! My war machines will rust if I don’t put them to use! Hahaha!” 
Bill’s hearty, boisterous voice rang out from afar. 
During the last attack on the Free Empire, he had been too busy constructing the royal palace to join. 
Otherwise, Lin Tian would have taken him along. 
Lin Tian responded, “Don’t worry, if you’re willing to go, I’d be more than happy! Queen Adele, long time no see!” 
“Hmph, now you call me Queen? What should I call you then, Your Majesty, or perhaps, Queen Consort?” Adele said with a haughty expression. 
Lin Tian wore a bitter smile. 
Bill chimed in, “Your Majesty, if you like a flower, do you have to pluck it? If you like a cloud, do you have to bring it down from the sky to touch it?” 
“I understand, I was only joking.”  
Adele shrugged, then turned to serious matters, “The Trojan Empire seems very ancient and powerful, not something the War Empire can compare to. Are you confident?” 
“Don’t worry, their high-level combat power is almost wiped out. We’ve got this.” Lin Tian replied. 
This was the main reason he didn’t take the Trojan Empire seriously. 
All ten of their heroes and three of their war gods had already met their end. 
The only one left who could fight was the King of Troy himself. Even if he had a sun-class magical weapon, Lin Tian could just steal it. 
And if he couldn’t steal it, it didn’t matter. 
With so many high-level forces on his side, he could simply wear them down until they were dead. 
As Alice gathered 300,000 elite goblins, Lin Tian mounted the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, preparing for battle. 
After all, the crystals on the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s body could also serve as protection. 
“By the way, has Persephia shared the puppet magic yet?”  
Lin Tian asked, realizing he had forgotten to assign someone to handle it. 
Gobu Yue raised her small hand, “Boss, she was resistant when others approached her, but later, I went to persuade her, and she passed it on to me.” 
“You?! But that’s human magic, right? You actually learned it?!” Lin Tian’s expression changed slightly, surprised. 
There was a clear distinction between humans and monsters. 
Many types of magic invented by humans could only be learned by humans, as one group used magical energy while the other used mana. 
To humans, the mana of monsters was considered an evil and corrupt force. 
It was powerful but needed to be restricted. 
Therefore, when creating magical skills, they typically made sure monsters couldn’t learn them. 
Only those black magic spells that yearn for monster mana could be learned. 
But black magic also represented evil and immense power, which made it forbidden and incredibly rare. 
Gobu Yue looked a bit bewildered. “I don’t know if I’ve really learned it, but I can make a lot of things move now, like this statue.” 
As she spoke, she pointed at a nearby lion statue. 
Immediately, the stone-carved lion, made from mottled minerals, sprang to life. It leaped and prowled, letting out a low, beastly growl. 
“This! No way, could puppet magic be black magic?” 
“No, it’s more likely that Lady Gobu Yue here is actually capable of learning human magic!” 
“How strange! Also, we’ve never seen her true form before. It’s unbelievable!” 
Everyone was shocked in this moment!  
What was even more astonishing was how quickly she had mastered puppet magic and was able to use it! 
Although it wasn’t considered world-class magic, it was a complex, compound spell that was extremely difficult to learn. 
Otherwise, it wouldn’t be regarded as the treasured national artifact of the Giant Elephant Empire. 
Lin Tian quickly calmed down. He was no longer surprised by Gobu Yue’s abilities, as she was a walking miracle and a complete mystery. 
He then said, “Alright, let’s get going. Our destination is far, and it will take a long time just to get there.” 
Everyone began to leave the city. 
Outside, the goblin army had already gathered, along with the dwarves’ magical war machines. 
They began their march! 
… 
The Trojan Empire. 
The weather today was particularly dreadful. 
Not only was the sun scorching high above, but a fierce yellow sandstorm also swept across the land. 
The sand particles were like sparks, burning anyone they touched. 
The King of Troy gazed at the sky with a heavy expression. 
Beside him stood an old woman dressed in strange garb, the empire’s High Priestess. 
The Trojan High Priestess was deep in her divinations when she suddenly gasped in shock, “Your Majesty, today’s harsh weather is an omen. It signifies that our empire will scatter like this yellow sand and no longer hold together…” 
“I asked you to predict whether the Trojan War Gods succeeded, and this is what you tell me? We’ve stood strong on this desert for thousands of years, and now you say we’ll fall apart like that?” the King of Troy bellowed. 
His outburst was understandable to the High Priestess. 
The empire had suffered great losses recently, which was why his mood was so sour. 
Not only had they failed to conquer the Goblin Empire, but they had also lost ten of their Trojan heroes, and the princess’ incident had become a national disgrace. 
It was enough to make anyone bitter. 
The High Priestess sighed and spoke with gravity, “Your Majesty, since I’ve divined the empire’s collapse, it means the Trojan War Gods have all perished and returned to the sands…” 
Thud! 
The King of Troy’s heart lurched. 
He had already suspected as much. After all, it had been too long without news from them. The odds of their survival were slim. 
He let out a heavy sigh. “Are we really going to be wiped out by a bunch of goblins? I can’t understand it. How could mere goblins rise to such power?” 
“How could the gods allow such an evil, lowly race to dominate this continent? Is he truly invincible within the wilderness?” 
At this, the High Priestess shook her head and replied, “Every race exists because the gods allow it, and that includes the goblins. But the fate of the Trojans lies in our own hands.” 
At that moment, something seemed to click for the King of Troy. His pupils narrowed, and he declared, “I understand now, High Priestess. The Trojans will fight to the end! Those mere goblins will be defeated by us!!!” 
With that, he pulled out a triangular golden eye amulet from around his neck. 
It was the legendary sun-class magic tool, the Millennial Eye! 
Thousands of years ago, this desert land was full of monsters and danger. 
The first Trojan was granted the ‘Millennial Eye’ by the gods and used it to establish the empire on this barren land. 
Now, the King of Troy intended to rely on the Millennial Eye to restore the glory of the empire, just as it had been created thousands of years ago! 
Guarding the empire was as glorious as building it. 
He immediately began summoning the elders from all the great families, preparing for a council. 
“How is it going? Have we killed that disgrace to Troy, Sara?” 
“Why haven’t the war gods returned after all this time?” 
“Calm down, His Majesty has called for a council meeting, which means there must be some progress.” 
The elders murmured amongst themselves. 
The King of Troy cleared his throat and spoke sternly, “Silence! Today, the High Priestess has brought grave news. The gods have said that the Trojan Empire will collapse, scattering like today’s sands. But I refuse to accept this! The fate of the Trojans has always been in our own hands! Are you all ready to fight these goblins to the death?!” 
His voice was loud and forceful. 
Its power stirred the room. 
Upon hearing this. 
The elders, who were no cowards, burst into laughter. 
“Hahaha! Goblins? Your Majesty, do you think we Trojans are afraid of such low-level monsters?” 
“Even if they are strong, even if we can’t defeat them, we will never fear them!” 
“Fight to the end!!!” 
Hearing their fiery responses. 
The King of Troy smiled with satisfaction. “Excellent, this is the spirit of the Trojans! Prepare yourselves to fight those damned monsters to the end. Once we defeat the goblins, we will rule the entire continent within the wilderness!” 
“Yes!!!” 
The whole room erupted in cheers! 
Their fighting spirit surged!!! 
Each of them was filled with fighting spirit, showing not the slightest hint of fear. 
Afterward. 
Under the leadership of the elders from their respective families, they began preparing for the upcoming battle. 
All that was left was to wait for the arrival of the goblin army.
