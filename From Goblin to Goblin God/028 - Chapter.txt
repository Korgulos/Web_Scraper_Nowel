Chapter 28: A Deadly Stratagem! 
TL: Sungmin 
The next day. 
In Bright Town, every day was lived in constant fear. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother would come to harass at irregular intervals, keeping everyone on edge, unable to relax for even a moment. 
“It’s been so long; they should have returned by now, right?” 
Inside the tavern, the members of the Battle Roar Regiment drank and discussed. 
They were the reserve team, always ready to go out and fight, while the Sword Saintess took on the arduous task of standing guard. 
She stood on the highest clock tower like a statue. 
She dared not make another mistake. If something happened again in Bright Town, she couldn’t live up to her title. 
The title of ‘Guardian of the Holy Sword.’ 
Protecting the lives of the empire’s people. 
This moved the residents of Bright Town, who often came to persuade her to rest, offering money and food, all of which she refused. 
Another few days passed. 
Finally, the Battle Roar Regiment believed that Kasimov had also perished in the enchanted forest. 
“Damn it, what kind of goblin tribe is this? One after another, they die!” 
“Why do I feel like we’re caught in a deadly stratagem?” 
“A deadly stratagem? Hiss! If that’s true, it would be terrifying! Impossible, impossible.” 
As they discussed, the Sword Saintess entered. 
She spoke directly, “All of you leave here and go to the capital to request reinforcements. It’s the only way. We are in a very unfavorable situation.” 
On one side, there was the dragon’s restraint; on the other, the goblin threat. 
More reinforcements were needed to solve all the problems at once. 
“Moreover, if we leave those goblins unchecked, they will likely leave here, and their development could become a great threat.” The Sword Saintess added. 
The enchanted forest was almost devoid of monsters and animals. 
Clearly, the goblins had captured and eaten everything. Without food, they were likely to migrate. 
The grudge was not yet avenged; how could they let them leave? 
Hearing this, the members of the Battle Roar Regiment exchanged glances, finding her words reasonable. 
But the leader of the Battle Roar Regiment was somewhat unwilling, “If we do that, wouldn’t we be deserters? We’ve always been at the forefront of every mission! You go for reinforcements; I’ll deal with those goblins myself! I don’t believe we can’t beat a bunch of lowly beasts!” 
The impression of goblins had always been that they were low-level creatures, easily killed. 
They didn’t believe that a few hero and big variants could cause such trouble. 
The other leaders were speechless; this had been said too many times. 
Then, they all dragged him out, “Let’s go, Captain! Time waits for no one, we must hurry to the capital!” 
Dragged and pulled, the Battle Roar Regiment leader finally relented. 
But on the way back to the capital, he still grumbled. 
… 
On a small mountain outside Bright Town, Lin Tian, as usual, rode his dragon, lurking in the dense forest, observing the situation. 
Seeing the Battle Roar Regiment come out, he couldn’t help but smile smugly. 
“Hmph, it seems these guys are stupid enough to fall into my stratagem one by one.” Lin Tian sneered, preparing to leave first. 
But suddenly, he noticed something wrong; they were heading along the main road, not towards the enchanted forest. 
Immediately, he understood, “Trying to get reinforcements? No, I can’t let them escape!” 
“Hurry, get ahead of them!” 
Lin Tian rode his dragon, flying ahead of the Battle Roar Regiment. 
Soon, he saw a wooden bridge over a cliff, just what he was looking for. 
Cut off their path! 
Hovering above the bridge, he pulled out the Elemental Hand Crossbow, choosing a flame arrow. 
He shot one, quickly setting the entire bridge on fire. 
Below was a bottomless abyss; they would surely choose to return or rebuild the bridge. 
“Cackle, cackle, it seems Heaven favors me; this opportunity is too good.” 
Lin Tian suddenly thought of something, his mouth curling into a smile. 
This time, not only would he take out these guys, but he would also capture Bright Town! 
The opportunity was rare, so he hurried back to the Tian Kuang Tribe to gather the goblins! 
… 
On the dirt road in the distance, the urgent sound of horse hooves echoed. 
The Battle Roar Regiment members were galloping swiftly. 
These horses were first-tier magic beasts, ‘Carnivorous Horses,’ resembling ordinary horses but with sharp teeth, eating only meat. 
The advantage of taming them was their strong endurance, able to run hundreds of kilometers a day. 
Ordinary horses would collapse after running a few dozen kilometers. 
They were considered the best means of transportation in this world. 
“Wait! Stop!” 
Suddenly, the Battle Roar Regiment leader’s anxious voice sounded, and everyone pulled on the reins, stopping the galloping horses. 
They saw that the wooden bridge over the cliff ahead had turned into a pile of charcoal. 
It seemed that a light touch would cause the whole bridge to crumble. 
“Who set this fire? Damn it!” 
“Damn it, who the hell is so lacking in morality! Come out, and I’ll cut you down immediately!” 
“Come out, you damn coward! Afraid to admit what you did, you cowardly wimp!” 
The crowd shouted angrily, but only the echoes in the valley answered; no one came forward to admit it. 
With the bridge destroyed, their expressions were as if they had eaten something foul. 
How long would this delay them? 
Without a second thought, the Battle Roar Regiment leader immediately ordered, “Everyone, chop down trees and build a bridge! We can’t waste any time!” 
Upon hearing this, everyone quickly dismounted and started working. 
However, building a hundred-meter-long wooden bridge was no easy task. 
They could get across easily, but without horses, walking to the capital would take so long that Bright Town’s people would be long dead. 
The group plunged into busy work: some chopped trees, others split planks, and others drew up structural plans. 
They also sent someone back to get ropes and chains. 
The estimated time needed was one day. 
At this moment. 
In the Tian Kuang Tribe, Lin Tian had gathered all the goblins again, “We’re going to do something big soon! We’ll act in two groups. If you do well, there will be great rewards. If not, we all might die!” 
“Boss, what are we going to do?” Gobu Tian asked in confusion. 
Lin Tian continued to explain, “Gobu Tian, you take fifty goblins and carefully hide in the dense forest outside Bright Town. The farther you stay, the better. You observe the area but don’t get discovered. 
When you see a woman in platinum armor leave Bright Town, take all the goblins and rush in. Capture all the women, but be careful not to expose your tracks.” 
“Understood, boss. What about you?” 
Gobu Tian scratched his head, feeling hesitant to lead the other goblins alone. 
Lin Tian then looked at Gobu Kuang, “You come with me. We’ll intercept a knight group led by a bald guy. This time, I’m going to become a general!” 
Beside them, Loder, who was tied up, was dumbfounded. 
However, this time he didn’t get angry or shout but laughed darkly, “Hehehe, good. I really admire your cleverness. You’re a terrifyingly strong opponent. Go ahead, take Bright Town! That filthy mongrel should have been dead long ago!” 
“Oh? Playing the misanthrope now? That’s not like you. Aren’t you waiting for the Sword Saintess to rescue you?” Lin Tian asked. 
Of course, he knew why; this was what Lin Tian wanted. 
Step by step, he tormented their spirits until they completely broke down. 
Only Ifreya had broken down after a short time. 
Loder sneered, “Do I need rescue? Am I dead? I don’t feel pain anymore! I’m perfectly fine!” 
“Those people are the ones who really deserve to die! That filthy bitch in platinum armor should die! Die! Die! Die!” 
Loder’s expression twisted and contorted again. 
He kept muttering ‘die,’ his body convulsing violently. 
It looked like a severe illness. 
It was quite creepy to watch. 
Lin Tian felt that Loder’s condition was more serious than expected. Without saying more, he ordered, “Gobu Yue, as usual, I’ll leave the tribe in your hands when I’m gone. Understand?” 
“Yes, boss. Don’t worry, I’ll keep watch.” Gobu Yue nodded vigorously. 
Then, Lin Tian mounted his dragon, and the goblins set off. 
The Battle Roar Regiment was racing against time, and so was Lin Tian. 
However, Lin Tian’s pace on his dragon was slowed down a lot, as the other goblins, except for the goblin assassins and big goblins, couldn’t keep up. 
In about half a day, they reached a dense forest about ten kilometers from Bright Town. 
Lin Tian instructed, “Now, split into two groups. Gobu Tian, move quietly forward until you see Bright Town. Remember what I told you.” 
“No problem, boss!” Gobu Tian said. 
The intelligence of the hero variant was reliable enough not to mess things up. 
The remaining goblins, along with Gobu Kuang and Gobu Shan, followed Lin Tian. 
From such a distance, flying the bipedal dragon at very low altitudes wouldn’t be discovered by the Sword Saintess. 
Soon, they arrived at a small mountain outside the broken bridge cliff. 
From a distance, they saw the Battle Roar Regiment busy at the cliff. 
“So fast? They’ve already started building the bridge!” Lin Tian exclaimed in disbelief. 
The Battle Roar Regiment leader had thrown a rope over to a giant rock on the other side of the cliff and was tying the bridge structure to a long iron chain. 
They dragged the iron chain, inching across the makeshift rope bridge. 
Several others climbed to the opposite side. 
One person stayed to secure the bridge. 
The rest pulled the chain with all their might, their veins bulging on their foreheads, and their muscles creaking from the strain! 
After all, such a long bridge weighed at least thousands, if not tens of thousands of pounds! 
Ordinary people couldn’t pull it, but they were all level forty or fifty, far stronger than normal people. 
“Phew, if the Sword Saintess were here, she could probably pull it by herself, right? This is exhausting.” One member sighed, wiping sweat from his forehead. 
The Battle Roar Regiment leader snorted, “Give me ten more years, and I won’t be any worse than the Sword Saintess, got it? Why do you all look down on me?” 
“Ten years? By then, the Sword Saintess will probably be at an unimaginable level.” 
“Hahaha!” 
They joked, preparing to mount their horses and leave. 
“Let’s go, time waits for no one!” 
As they cautiously walked onto the wooden bridge, the sky suddenly darkened as if the sun had been blocked. 
However, it was just a fleeting moment. 
Immediately, the Battle Roar Regiment leader’s expression changed, “This isn’t good!” 
Looking ahead, a dragon appeared, flapping its enormous wings and stirring up a storm! 
It slowly landed on the other side of the bridge. 
It was Lin Tian! 
Its massive form and dragon’s might left them all stunned!
