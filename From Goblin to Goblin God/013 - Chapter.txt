Chapter 13: Dragon Invasion 
TL: Sungmin 
“Roar!” 
Suddenly, a thunderous roar echoed from the distant sky! 
Deafening and shattering! 
It was a fear embedded in human instinct! 
Most of the residents of Bright Town were so scared that their legs went weak, nearly collapsing to the ground. 
Women and children ran into their houses in terror. 
Even Loder and his team wiped cold sweat from their foreheads. 
The dragon’s might was too terrifying. 
However, a majestic figure stood on the city wall, a platinum cape fluttering in the wind, showing no fear at all! 
It boosted everyone’s morale. 
The fear significantly diminished. 
After all, with the Sword Saintess here, everything would be fine. 
“Tell the residents to let the elderly, women, and children take refuge in the shelter. Leave these flying lizards to us.” The Sword Saintess said coldly. 
Full of disdain. 
Besides Loder’s group, the other hero teams mainly assisted in evacuating the masses. 
Suddenly, the clouds in the sky were swept away by a gust of wind. 
The dragons finally appeared. 
Their bodies were covered in black and brown skin, without fur, sharp fangs, and claws, with dragon wings that blotted out the sky! 
Their size was about fifteen meters, but their maximum wingspan was close to fifty meters! 
They were just like the dragons in Western mythology. 
“Have they arrived?” The Sword Saintess said calmly. 
She single-handedly loaded the dragon-hunting crossbow, aiming at the sky seven to eight hundred meters away. 
Aimed, and fired! 
“Whoosh!” 
A piercing sound of the arrow breaking through the air exploded instantly! 
One must know, this crossbow required ten adult men to pull it! And she did it single-handedly, fully drawn! 
Incredibly, a distant, sorrowful dragon’s roar rang out! 
The giant dragon, like a bird with broken wings, fell from the sky! 
This scene immediately moved all the residents of Bright Town to tears of gratitude! 
“Indeed, the Sword Saintess is incredibly strong!” 
“We just need to take refuge, and when we come out, the dragon threat will be over! Hahaha!” 
“God bless us, after this incident, we should build a grand statue for the Saintess!” 
The residents, amidst cheers, hid in the shelter without any tension or fear. 
However, two or three dozen men stayed behind to help. 
With the hero teams, about fifty people in total, it was more than enough. 
With the fall of the first dragon, its death roar immediately enraged the remaining dragons. 
Seven or eight dragons that came out to hunt quickly broke through the clouds, heading towards Bright Town! 
Moreover, on Dragon Island hundreds of miles away, a giant creature suddenly opened its eyes! 
“I have already shown you how to use the dragon-hunting crossbow. Don’t be too stupid.” The Sword Saintess said calmly. 
Suddenly, she executed a rapid spinning kick, sending the timber used to make the dragon-hunting crossbow flying. 
In the distance, a dragon’s pupils suddenly contracted! 
It was too late to dodge, and blood spurted from its eyes on the spot! 
Screaming, it lost direction and crashed to the ground! 
The nearby dragons were puzzled, only to be struck by more flying timber. 
All hit their marks! 
Although it didn’t kill the dragons, it caused substantial damage. 
This scene left everyone else stunned. 
The timber scraps could suppress so many dragons! 
And her eyes were still blindfolded. If she took off the blindfold, the timber scraps would probably slay the dragons! 
She was incredibly strong, at a whole different level! 
“The real dragon is coming, everyone get ready at the dragon-hunting crossbows.” At this moment, the Sword Saintess said solemnly. 
Seeing her on guard, the others were so scared they scrambled to get in position. 
“Roar!!!” 
Suddenly, a lightning-like dragon roar resounded through the heavens and earth! 
This roar far surpassed the previous dragon’s roar, on a completely different level! 
“Look, look there! Oh my God! What is that!” A resident shouted in terror. 
In the distant sky, a truly enormous dragon broke through the clouds! 
Its head was larger than an entire ordinary dragon. 
Its body was dark purple with numerous prominent golden-purple bone spurs, so massive it seemed like a mountain moving closer! 
A creature over a hundred meters long! 
With a wingspan close to five hundred meters! 
The swarming dragons around it looked like tadpoles in comparison! 
Loder’s heavy voice spoke, “Purple-Gold Dragon Mother! A level 79 super monster!” 
“Is that the Dragon King? Quick, shoot!” 
The crowd finally reacted, all drawing their bows and loading. 
Ten dragon-hunting crossbows fired simultaneously in the direction of the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother! 
The piercing sound of the arrows breaking through the air felt like it could rupture eardrums. 
However, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother opened her gaping maw, spewing a torrent of golden-purple flames! 
The incoming arrows were all reduced to ashes. 
Moreover, the flames lasted for an extended period! 
They shot from over a kilometer away, reaching the front of Bright Town! 
Everything in its path was scorched to cinders, rendering the arrows ineffective. 
Faced with that terrifying heat wave, the residents’ legs went weak, unable to stand! 
If they were to be hit by those flames, they would turn to ashes instantly! 
“High-tier Sword Skill, Sword Qi Surge!” 
Finally! 
The Sword Saintess drew her sword! 
A flash of cold light appeared as a magical array gathered on her longsword, unleashing a sword qi wall as grand and overwhelming as a tsunami! 
“Swoosh swoosh swoosh!” 
It directly blocked the dragon flames. 
Loder had seen much in his time, but the other members of the hero team were so shocked they nearly shouted! 
“High-tier Sword Skill! My god, it’s High-tier!” 
“As expected of the Sword Saintess, witnessing the use of a high-tier sword skill is worth dying for!” 
“The dragon flames were just blocked like that, incredible!” 
Sword skills, magic, martial arts, and so forth were collectively referred to as combat skills. 
They were categorized into low-tier, mid-tier, high-tier, super-tier, ultimate, world-class, half moon-class, full moon-class, and sun-class, among others. 
A high-tier magic spell was already rare to see anyone use. 
Not to mention the higher levels. 
With the dragon flames blocked, Loder and his team quickly fired more arrows. 
Three flying dragons were shot down on the spot! 
The remaining arrows hit the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, but to her, they were like toothpicks. 
Merely causing slight pain. 
“Roar!” 
Despite some losses, the flying dragons entered the town’s range! 
One blast of dragon flames and a house was instantly destroyed! 
Mouthful after mouthful, they wreaked havoc, destroying everything effortlessly! 
The residents hiding in the shelter, hearing the deafening sounds, couldn’t help but feel a bit frightened again. 
At this moment, a mother comforted her crying child, “Don’t be afraid, don’t be afraid, everything will be fine. We just need to stay here, it’s very safe.” 
“Yes, even if the town is destroyed, we won’t be affected. It’s very safe.” 
With this reassurance, the residents breathed a sigh of relief. 
At worst, they could rebuild their homes later. 
But was it really safe? 
… 
“Ah, what a beautiful fireworks show.” 
On a small hill far from Bright Town, Lin Tian watched the sea of flames in the distance, unable to help but sigh. 
As he spoke, a wicked smile appeared on his lips.
