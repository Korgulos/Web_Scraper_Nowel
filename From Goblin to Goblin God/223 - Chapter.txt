Chapter 223: “Zerg Queen, I Love You!” 
TL: Sungmin  
“The Goblin King, is it? I’ve heard that you’ve already unified the continent within the wilderness. That’s quite impressive.” 
The voice of the Zerg Queen seemed to come from all directions, ethereal and without a clear source. 
Due to the difference in sound wave frequencies, it felt strange and overwhelming to hear. 
However, a shadow flickered across Lin Tian’s face. 
This damn creature—was she being sarcastic? 
He immediately forced a smile. “No matter how impressive, I’m nothing compared to you, Zerg Queen.” 
“Slick-tongued. I despise people like that…” 
Unexpectedly, the Zerg Queen suddenly grew angry without any apparent reason. 
Two black fleshy orbs suddenly ejected from her massive body. 
They bounced on the ground a few times with incredible elasticity. 
In an instant! 
They transformed into two seven or eight-meter-tall, vicious-looking black insects. 
Their entire bodies were covered in shiny, armor-like shells. 
The two insects opened their semi-circular mouths wide enough to swallow a cow and screeched at Lin Tian! 
Inside their gaping mouths, countless worm-like teeth were densely packed, making them horrifying to behold. 
Lin Tian remained unmoved, opening his status panel to check the strength of these creatures. 
These two black insects were called ‘Zerg Kings,’ similar to Ant Kings, but they were completely under the command of the Zerg Queen. 
They were Demon King-class creatures with a combat power of 16,000. 
Moreover… 
There was the Zerg Queen herself.

Looking at this unparalleled overall combat strength, a hint of caution flashed in Lin Tian’s eyes. 
She was truly a formidable opponent. 
Even Joan was no match for her. 
However, her main strength seemed to lie in producing demon insects. As for individual combat power, it was likely not her forte. 
A massive size didn’t necessarily mean overwhelming strength. 
Still, the insects she produced were daunting. 
She could casually summon two Demon King-class creatures, which was already terrifying. 
“Your Highness, Zerg Queen, I was only speaking the truth. How could goblins possibly compare to noble demon insects?” 
Lin Tian lowered his head, adopting a repentant tone. 
Hearing this… 
A hearty laugh echoed, and the Zerg Queen responded, “You’re quite sensible. With such an understanding, it’s no wonder you’ve come this far.” 
In the next moment… 
The two Demon King-class insects withdrew to the side. 
Lin Tian breathed a sigh of relief. In his previous life simulation, he had been killed outright for underestimating the Demon Zerg Tribe. 
Even though he still looked down on them, he needed to buy himself another year of development time. 
Bowing his head wasn’t a big deal. 
He continued, “With your noble presence, I dare not claim to have unified the land within the wilderness. The reason I’ve come this time is to pledge myself as a vassal nation, to submit to your rule. All the territory I’ve conquered would belong to you…” 
Upon hearing this… 
The Zerg Queen’s massive body shifted slightly, intrigued. “You’re willing to give me all the land? You’re more obedient than I expected.” 
“Of course…” Lin Tian kept his head down. 
But in the next second, the Zerg Queen changed her tone again. “However, you’re unworthy to be my vassal! Even more unworthy to submit to me! You hold no value to me!” 
As she spoke, the two Zerg Kings began sharpening their weapons, ready to strike. 
Lin Tian’s face darkened. 
He hadn’t expected this damn Zerg Queen to be so cunning and repulsive. 
Even after bowing this low, she still wanted to kill him. 
Hurriedly, he said, “Wait, I can be of value to the Zerg Empire! Does the Zerg Empire not wish to conquer the lands beyond the wilderness? We goblins can serve as your scouts!” 
“Oh? What you’re saying seems reasonable.” 
The Zerg Queen’s voice had barely fallen when the two Zerg Kings paused. 
But then she turned again, “However, our Zerg Tribe is vast in number and incredibly powerful. There’s no need for goblins to scout for us!” 
Lin Tian nearly despaired at hearing this. 
This wretched creature was not only hard to deceive, but also impossible to manipulate. 
With a quick shift in his expression, his gaze filled with affection, he said, “You misunderstand. I meant that goblins could serve as your slaves, doing anything you ask! Because… because I love you, my Queen, deeply!” 
At the mention of love… 
The Zerg Queen’s brow arched slightly, her tone mocking. “You… love me?” 
Lin Tian nodded vigorously. 
Immediately, the Zerg Queen burst into laughter. “A hideous, lowly goblin dares to love me? Dares to dream of possessing me? How delusional! But… did you say you’d do anything for me?” 
Lin Tian took a few slow steps forward and, with deep emotion, kissed one of her massive antennae. 
“Yes, my Queen, my great Zerg Queen. Even if it means death, I am willing!” 
“Shhh!” 
Suddenly, one of the Zerg Kings dashed forward, its sword-like arms slashing through the air.  
The attack halted just 0.1 centimeters from Lin Tian’s eye, barely stopping before it could crush his skull.  
But it stopped. 
The Zerg Queen, quite pleased, remarked, “Interesting. Very well then, from now on, you will serve me here. I want to see what a goblin’s love feels like…” 
For thousands of years, she had only been served by worker insects. 
Life had gotten rather dull. 
“Serve you here?” Lin Tian asked in confusion. 
The Zerg Queen rolled her eyes and explained, “Don’t get any foolish ideas, you despicable creature. By serving me, I mean you will clean up my waste every day and haul food for me. That’s it! Did you think you could mate with me?” 
“No, no, just being by your side is more than enough for me,” Lin Tian hurriedly nodded. This damned creature—she was just using him as her pet. 
At least he could stay alive for now. 
He would secretly develop the goblin forces and inform Gobu Yue and the others when the time came. It was already something he was familiar with. 
As long as the goblin population could surpass the insect race, they could declare war. 
The Zerg Queen’s expression shifted again. “It seems your sincerity is lacking. I’m starting to doubt whether you really love me. If you truly loved me, you’d at least show some interest in my body, wouldn’t you?” 
“So, what do you mean…?” Lin Tian looked at her, puzzled. 
The Zerg Queen’s lips curled upward into a very sinister smile. 
… 
From that day forward, Lin Tian had to clean up literal tons of waste for her every day. Her colossal body, spanning thousands of meters, excreted thousands of tons at a time! 
It could pile up into a small mountain. 
Due to her enormous size, she consumed massive quantities of food, which left Lin Tian nearly dead from exhaustion just moving it around. 
The more she ate, the more she produced. 
Luckily, worker insects helped out; otherwise, he would have died from the workload alone. 
The worst part came at night. 
Every night, Lin Tian was tied up by her tentacles and tortured relentlessly—often for the entire night. 
And the Zerg Queen forced him to engage only with her enormous insect body, not her true form. 
If she wasn’t satisfied, he would be killed. 
Fortunately, the Evil Goblin skill he had plundered before came in handy, allowing him to “adjust” his body size to meet her demands. 
However, the downside of enlarging his body was that he lost ten pounds each time. Lin Tian, already frail, now looked as emaciated as when he had first transmigrated. 
It was as if he had seen “Sister Angel” once again. 
For days, he hadn’t had the opportunity to send a message to the Flame Dragon Mother. 
The Zerg Queen had completely confined him, treating him as her slave. 
Not only did he have to work, but he also had to “serve” her. 
There are typically two types of slaves: labor slaves and personal slaves, but rarely would someone endure both roles simultaneously. 
Yet Lin Tian… 
“I will get revenge for this! Damned insect! When the time comes, I’ll capture your true form and make you both types of slave!” Lin Tian swore darkly to himself. 
The next day. 
With three times his usual speed, Lin Tian cleaned the waste and delivered all the food. 
He even went above and beyond, fully satisfying the Zerg Queen. 
Finally, he earned a brief period of time outside. 
Unfortunately, he still couldn’t reach outside the Zerg Empire to send a message to the Flame Dragon Mother due to the vast distance. 
So, he decided to seek out the Ant Queen. 
He planned to have her help send a message and expose the Ant King’s betrayal as leverage against the Zerg Queen. 
Inside the Ant Palace. 
When the Ant Queen saw Lin Tian, she was surprised. “Goblin King, it hasn’t been that long since we last met, but you look thinner.” 
His eyes were sunken, his cheeks hollow. 
His legs were as thin as bamboo sticks. 
It looked like a gust of wind could blow him over. 
Lin Tian cursed under his breath as he explained everything and made his requests. 
Upon hearing his story, the Ant Queen was astonished, thinking Lin Tian might have gone mad. 
“You’ve been enslaved by the Zerg Queen? As both types of slave? And the Ant King plans to betray us? What… what is all this?” 
However, looking at his appearance, it didn’t seem like he was lying. 
She immediately dispatched a scout ant to pass the message and instructions to the Flame Dragon Mother. 
The Ant Queen then asked, “Are you sure? The Ant King would betray us?” 
“Absolutely,” Lin Tian replied, his tone urgent. “Time is running out. If you trust me, gather your soldier ants immediately. I’ll help you kill the Ant King.” 
“From what you’ve said, it does seem possible. The Ant King would do anything to ensure the survival of the Ant Tribe. But I’m more curious about your second slave role,” the Ant Queen said teasingly. 
Lin Tian’s face twitched. “There’s only one chance. If I leave, you might all be doomed. Is this really the time for jokes?” 
“Alright.” 
As soon as the Ant Queen spoke, thousands of soldier ants gathered. 
Their average combat strength wasn’t high, only around 1,000 to 2,000. 
But five or six thousand wasn’t the limit. It was just the palace’s capacity—there were millions more soldier ants outside. 
The Ant Queen spoke gravely, “I can send an endless stream of soldier ants to swarm him, but are you certain you can defeat him?” 
“Hmph, I’m more confident than anyone!” Lin Tian scoffed, pulling out the Spear of Zeus. 
This mission had to succeed, no matter what. 
Otherwise, there might never be another opportunity to leave. 
The Ant King had a combat power of 16,000, while Lin Tian’s was 15,000, boosted by his encounter with the Zerg Queen.  
With the constant reinforcements of soldier ants, defeating the Ant King shouldn’t be a problem. 
Suddenly. 
A wave of powerful demonic energy surged through the palace doors, carried by a chilling gust of wind, filling the air with dread! 
The voice of the Ant King echoed, “Your Majesty, Ant Queen, were you looking for me?”
