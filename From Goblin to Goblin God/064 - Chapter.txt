Chapter 64: The Monster Lord, the Cannibal Eagle! 
TL: Sungmin  
He couldn’t accept that the dignified Sword Saintess was raising a goblin as a child. 
It wasn’t just him; the church, the nobles, and the entire empire couldn’t accept it either. 
However, this time, Alicenia didn’t obey any imperial decree and completely ignored Charles II. 
This attitude made Charles II both angry and helpless. “Alice, my child, I watched you grow up. I personally bestowed the Holy Sword upon you. I am still the king of this country. Do you not even listen to me anymore?” 
“Your Majesty, Alice would never dare to disobey your orders, but this is the will of God.” 
Alicenia gently stroked the goblin cub in her arms, which was sleeping soundly after eating its fill. 
In the cultural dominance of a medieval background, power was absolute. No one dared to challenge imperial authority. 
But there was one power that was even more deeply rooted in people’s hearts than imperial authority: divine power. 
The supreme divine power. 
So even the Lionheart Emperor had to show great respect to the church. 
Hearing this, Charles II was initially stunned and looked in surprise at the Holy Mother standing at the door, silently asking for an explanation. 
The Holy Mother squinted her eyes and shook her head helplessly, indicating that she also didn’t know what divine will Alice was referring to. 
Charles II hurriedly asked, “Alice, what is the will of God?” 
After a long silence, Alicenia finally said, “That is, to accept his punishment, so I can regain the power of God.” 
“What… what are you saying? You have tirelessly fought for the people of the empire, God would not punish you,” Charles II said in astonishment. 
Alicenia seemed to be recalling something painful. “I… I did something that angered God. My holy power has been stripped away. Only by accepting the punishment will God forgive me.” 
The punishment she spoke of was this goblin cub. 
That was why she did not reject it but accepted it gladly. 
Hearing this, Charles II felt bewildered and curiously asked, “What exactly happened? Tell me.” 
“I killed many soldiers… and failed to avenge them, so God stripped me of my power and sent down this punishment,” Alicenia said with a look of pain and seriousness. 
God was inherently abstract, and the specifics of divine will varied from person to person. It was normal for the Sword Saintess to believe this was divine punishment. 
At that moment, Charles II almost wanted to shout that God didn’t exist. He quickly looked at the Holy Mother and signaled to her. 
The Holy Mother, somewhat at a loss, thought for a moment and said, “Alice, this is not divine punishment; it is merely a failure. Pull yourself together.” 
“That’s right, pull yourself together! I will have Duke Klein lead troops to exterminate the goblins and avenge you…” Charles II echoed. 
The recent events involving the goblins had become increasingly serious, forcing him to personally order the troops to quell the disturbance. 
Otherwise, internal unrest would precede external pressures, making the Lionheart Empire unable to lift its head. 
Who could have imagined that a group of goblins could cause such a commotion? 
At this moment, Alicenia said again, “You don’t understand, none of you understand. I am no longer the Sword Saintess. I am just a tragic woman, Alicenia, who gave birth to a goblin. Get out, all of you, get out!” 
The reason she firmly believed this was divine punishment was all because Lin Tian’s Blood of Ruin suppressed her holy powers. It would naturally recover after ten days or so. 
Seeing her so agitated, Charles II and the others left the church first. 
“Your Majesty, Alice is not very rational right now. I think it’s best not to push her. Once she believes the punishment is over, she will regain her strength,” the Holy Mother softly suggested. 
Charles II sighed, “In my life, it was the first time I yelled at her like I did just now. Yet it was useless. What more can I do? During this time, I will trouble you to take care of that girl. You know how things are on my end.” 
Because of a goblin issue, thousands of people had come to the palace seeking help. 
Prepared for danger in times of peace, many villagers were living in constant fear. 
He hoped the situation could be resolved soon. 
Then, Charles II returned to the palace sanctuary, seated high on the throne, exuding lion-like majesty and solemnity. 
He sent for Duke Klein. 
Before long, the sound of knights’ armor clashing could be heard outside the hall. 
A red-haired young man in dazzling silver armor slowly walked in, appearing to be in his early twenties. 
His striking features carried a hint of charm even in their masculinity. 
Both beautiful and handsome. 
Despite his young age, he had become a duke, not through connections but through his strength. 
In the younger generation of the imperial family, his strength was second only to Alicenia’s. 
Moreover, he was Austin’s grandson. 
Charles II looked at him with satisfaction and asked, “Klein, do you know why I called you here?” 
“Your Majesty, I will quell the goblin chaos, avenge Alice, my grandfather, and those fallen citizens of the empire.” 
Klein knelt on one knee, speaking resolutely. 
There was even a trace of gritted-teeth hatred on his face. 
This was because he had grown up under Alice’s influence, basking in her brilliant and magnificent light. 
To him, Alice was like a life mentor and an aspirational goal. 
But now, his beloved was defiled by a goblin, and his grandfather was dead. How could he not be furious? 
Charles II continued, “Very well, then let me ask you, are you afraid of the Great Tomb?” 
According to the intelligence, Lin Tian and his group had already entered the Great Tomb. 
“Even if faced with those inside the Great Tomb, I fear nothing!” 
Klein declared firmly, his voice ringing out. 
Charles II couldn’t help but smile in satisfaction. “Good! I will give you ten thousand elite soldiers and twelve Holy Guards to accompany you! Even if you have to storm the Great Tomb, you must flatten that goblin tribe!” 
Hearing this, Klein was still a bit surprised. 
He was given ten thousand elite soldiers! Even the church people were going along. 
Immediately, he regained his composure. “I will not fail my mission!” 
… 
Tian Kuang Tribe. 
Lin Tian had already arranged all the large and small affairs properly. 
Moreover, the breeding of the first month had reached the time of delivery. 
Faced with so many people giving birth for the first time, Lin Tian had to participate personally. “Lia, have all the elves help with the deliveries.” 
The tribe was bustling with activity. 
The moans of the women echoed throughout the valley, attracting the covetous eyes of many monsters. 
On one hand, they had to help with the deliveries, and on the other hand, they had to guard both sides of the valley to prevent monsters from intruding. 
At this moment, Brutal, looking anxious, ran over. “Boss, we can’t hold them off in front. Why don’t you go take a look?” 
Lin Tian frowned; even he seemed frightened. 
He hurriedly rode his dragon to check it out. 
What he saw made him stunned! 
Outside the walls built at the mouth of the valley, there were dense, black masses everywhere! 
A system scan revealed: [Bloodthirsty Ghost], [Corpse Tiger], [Black Scale Horned Python], [Ghost-eyed Blood Spider]… 
There were several sixth-tier monsters gathered! 
As for the fifth-tier monsters, there were dozens or even hundreds! 
The situation at the rear was not much better; Gobu Kuang and the others couldn’t suppress them at all. 
Fortunately, the batch of muskets made by Lin Tian could hold them off; otherwise, they would have been overrun. 
“Damn it, I’ve scouted the surrounding ten kilometers, where did all these monsters come from? Damn it!” 
Lin Tian had calculated everything but missed this step. 
He had been so cautious for so long, only to fall short here. 
He had been careless. 
He thought that under the protection of the Great Tomb, he could do as he pleased. 
If he hadn’t been so busy these days, personally guiding the construction of the valley walls, the granary, the shelter, and the defense works, he would have used the Life Simulation System directly. 
With things as they were, Lin Tian had no choice but to say, “All goblins, leave via the cliffs. Leave the breeding tools; we’ll capture more later!” 
They were just consumables. 
If they died, so be it. He could spend another ten days or half a month capturing more outside. 
But just then, Lin Tian suddenly looked up and noticed a black figure—a birdman! 
Its eyes glowed blood-red in the dim light. 
It was staring intently at him. 
Its wings were full and beautiful, looking about the same size as a human, with a bird’s head and a human body covered in black feathers that were hard to see in the dark. 
Its feet had sharp claws that could easily crush a human skull.

Seeing its attribute panel, Lin Tian suddenly understood that this guy was the Monster Lord of this region! 
He remembered Brutal mentioning this before. 
The Cannibal Eagle looked at Lin Tian curiously and said incredulously, “A small goblin… can actually ride a dragon?” 
Those eyes stared so intensely that they gave Lin Tian goosebumps. 
The Cannibal Eagle then asked suspiciously, “Are you the leader of this tribe?” 
“Yes, Lord,” Lin Tian replied. “Lord, can you help disperse these gathered monsters?” 
There was still a chance to save the situation. With one order from the Lord, all the monsters could be driven away. 
However, the Cannibal Eagle tilted its head, coldly asking, “Why should I help you?” 
“I can offer you ten humans.” 
Lin Tian gritted his teeth. Anyway, it was just ten; exchanging ten for more than a thousand was worth it. 
The Cannibal Eagle squinted its eyes, pondered for a moment, and then flew high into the sky. 
It took a deep breath! 
A sharp screech emitted from its beak! 
Hearing this soul-shaking eagle cry, the gathered monsters scattered like they had seen a ghost! 
They hid like frightened chicks. 
Lin Tian covered his ears; the sound was too harsh. But seeing the horde of monsters disperse, he finally felt relieved. 
“The scent of humans will attract all the monsters within a hundred miles. Is this your first time in the Great Tomb?” The Cannibal Eagle flew back and asked. 
Lin Tian understood now. No wonder humans were so averse and fearful of the Great Tomb. 
It all made sense now. 
Humans giving birth would sweat profusely, emitting a strong scent that goblin smells couldn’t cover. 
Normally, it was fine. 
Lin Tian replied awkwardly, “I understand. Thank you, Lord. Let’s go, I will fulfill my promise.” 
Hearing this, the Cannibal Eagle smiled slightly. 
It followed him into the valley. 
Brutal was extremely grateful and, seeing the Cannibal Eagle, quickly knelt. “Lord!” 
However, the Cannibal Eagle paid him no mind and was very interested in those ten people. 
But when it saw the over a thousand people, it was utterly stunned! 
“You! Why do you have so many humans here? Are they all breeding tools for you goblins???”
