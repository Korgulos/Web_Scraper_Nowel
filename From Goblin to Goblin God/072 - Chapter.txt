Chapter 72: The Dream Demon and the Plan to Plunder the City! 
TL: Sungmin  
“The Sword Saintess, Alicenia, the woman known as the Guardian Holy Sword of the Empire, is now in the shack before you, begging Lin Tian to give her a child.” 
Goblin Slayer finished speaking, her smile unwavering. 
Her satisfaction with Lin Tian had reached an unprecedented level. 
It was truly unexpected to be able to achieve something like this. 
If this were spread within the Empire, one could only imagine the turmoil it would cause! 
Upon hearing this. 
Lilith and her group of mercenaries were all dumbfounded and immediately refuted, “Stop joking, who would believe such a thing? The Sword Saintess is someone I admire greatly. Her sense of responsibility, her mission, and her strength are even the strongest among all the Sword Saintesses throughout history!” 
In an era where women’s status was low, 
To achieve such a status was unprecedented. 
Even vampires, even the wife of Count Dracula. 
Lilith and the others, having lived in the Lionheart Empire for a long time, had immense admiration for the Sword Saintess. 
Goblin Slayer sneered and directly dragged her inside, “See for yourself, who is she?” 
“This!” 
Lilith’s eyes widened in disbelief at the woman before her, realizing it was truly her! 
“Lord Sword Saintess, how could you…” 
Her worldview seemed to collapse at that moment. 
Upon hearing this, Alicenia didn’t have the heart to respond, her eyes had completely turned into heart shapes. 
Her slender, fair jade hands tightly gripped the weeds beside her, crushing them one handful after another. 
Lilith even retreated a few steps in fear, exiting the shack, “How is this even possible?! And the Sword Saintess is… enjoying it?” 
Her heart-shaped eyes were filled with the word “desire.” 
“Hey, what are you doing in here? Get out, get out!” 
Lin Tian’s voice sounded from the shack, cursing. 
Goblin Slayer pouted, “Oh, don’t be like that. I used to admire the Sword Saintess and wanted to fight alongside her!” 
“Fight alongside my ass, go away.” 
Helplessly, Goblin Slayer was still thrown out, thinking she could finally fight alongside the Sword Saintess. 
A long time passed. 
Until the next day, Lin Tian finally walked out of the shack, looking refreshed, though his legs trembled as if he couldn’t stand properly when the wind blew. 
However, he at least seemed spirited. 
“These unreliable legs.” Lin Tian muttered in annoyance. 
Goblin Slayer snickered beside him, “It’s not your legs, it’s clearly your kidneys, right? Where is the Sword Saintess? Why hasn’t she come out?” 
“You go see for yourself.” Lin Tian said, heading off to rest. 
Too many good things had happened at once, he needed to sort them out slowly. 
Not only had he obtained the Sword Saintess, but he had also truly gained her in every sense, able to make her help him with matters. 
Upon hearing this. 
Lilith anxiously rushed to see for herself. 
She saw Alicenia lying in the shack as if in a faint, her eyes rolled upwards, “Lord God, please forgive me…” 
“No…” 
Lilith covered her mouth, unable to bear watching any longer. 
If the people of the Empire saw this, the imperial family and the church would probably go mad. 
At this time, Gobu Yue found Lin Tian and asked, “Boss, what should we do with the Sword Saintess?” 
They couldn’t let her stay in that dirty and filthy shack forever. 
It was all unsightly stuff. 
“Arrange for her to stay with me. Take her to change clothes and have a bath, there are human clothes collected over there.” 
Lin Tian thought for a moment and said. 
Arranging her elsewhere with no one watching could be troublesome if she ran away or did something else. 
Gobu Yue agreed and started to make arrangements. 
Lin Tian thought that he needed to inform the Cannibal Eagle about the death of the Iguana Lord. Hiding it would make people suspect there was something wrong. 
Then he went to the Giant Forest, bringing along two weak, almost dying humans. 
Even though Ifreya was a nun, she was still a novice and had much to learn. 
He planned to help her improve her healing methods someday. 
Having her as his healer wasn’t bad, she was well-trained enough anyway. 
“Little Tian, why are you here?” 
The Cannibal Eagle saw him and flew down from a distant tall tree, its left claw holding a fat white worm. 
“Just dug this out from the tree, it’s a unique product of the Giant Forest, very delicious.” 
Lin Tian looked at the wriggling, furry, maggot-like worm and felt nauseous. 
He quickly declined, “I’m not hungry now, Lord Cannibal Eagle. I just want to tell you something, whether it’s good or bad.” 
He said, first throwing the two dying humans onto the tree. 
A branch of the giant tree was over ten meters wide, like flat ground. 
The Cannibal Eagle’s eyes lit up, and it immediately threw the worm far away, “This thing doesn’t seem so tasty after all. What is it? Speak directly.” 
“Do you remember the Iguana Lord you brought earlier…?” Lin Tian hesitated. 
The Cannibal Eagle nodded, “Oh, that guy. You must be pissed, right? He was indeed too much. I’ll take you to deal with him right away! How dare he threaten to harm you and your kin. Does he think I’m just called Cannibal Eagle for no reason?” 
“No, I wanted to tell you that I killed him and his kin.” Lin Tian said it so casually. 
The Cannibal Eagle didn’t immediately react, “Oh! So you killed him… Wait, what! You killed the Southern Lord!!!” 
For a moment, he lost his appetite for eating. 
He stared at Lin Tian in shock. 
“Well…” 
Lin Tian began to explain, but the Cannibal Eagle interrupted, “No need to explain. If I could have killed him, I wouldn’t have spared him either. This is troublesome now, but there’s still a chance. If you become the Southern Lord, we can still account for it to the Great Tomb.” 
“I don’t want to be the lord, that’s why I came to you. Just tell them one of my subordinates did it. How about that?” Lin Tian grinned, eyeing the two humans. 
It seemed to suggest that favors come with obligations. 
Surprisingly, the Cannibal Eagle was very amenable to this, sighing, “Your tribe is still in its developing stage and needs your management, so we can only send your subordinate. But… there is a risk.” 
“Risk? Why?” 
“If you go, I believe you can defeat the competitors for the Southern Lord position, but I’m not sure about your subordinate.” 
The Cannibal Eagle spoke with a serious expression, “With the Iguana Lord dead, the Dream Demon from the south will definitely compete for the lord position. He has coveted it for over a century but has never defeated the previous lords.” 
Dream Demon? 
Lin Tian quickly asked what kind of creature it was. 
The Cannibal Eagle explained, “It’s an eighth-tier monster that can control others’ dreams, born from nightmares. It’s not strong in direct combat but excels at manipulating dreams. 
That’s why it never became the Southern Lord.” Lin Tian pondered deeply. 
A Dream Demon, able to control others’ dreams. 
That was incredible! It was just what he needed! 
“Lord Cannibal Eagle, can you take me to see him quickly? I want to collaborate with him!” Lin Tian was a bit excited. 
If the Dream Demon could control the Sword Saintess’s dreams and have her believe that God was instructing her, she would follow without question! 
This way, she could be completely controlled and turned into a puppet! 
He also planned to capture a city to get some magic books for Ifreya to enhance her abilities. 
Having the Sword Saintess lead the attack would be perfect. 
The goblins’ plundering nature had been stifled for too long. 
Hearing this, the Cannibal Eagle, though puzzled, still took him to the south. 
“This is where the Dream Demon resides.” 
Before them lay a thorny thicket shrouded in mist, with dried, twisted brambles everywhere, making it impossible to move without getting scratched. 
A moment of inattention could lead to injury. 
At this moment, a huge eye lit up in the mist. 
And a hollow, eerie monster voice sounded, “Let me see, who needs a sweet dream?” 
The eye moved closer, finally revealing its appearance. 
It looked like a footless ghost, floating above the thorns, draped in a tattered black robe. 
Its hood covered not a head but a single large black eye with a red pupil! 
It had no head. 
Just a head-sized eye. 
Its hands were withered and purple, resembling tree branches. 
It emanated a resentful black aura. 
“So it’s the Cannibal Eagle. What do you want? Do you need a sweet dream?” The Dream Demon laughed eerily. 
Lin Tian spoke first, “No, I want to collaborate with you. I’ll make you the Southern Lord, and you help me control others’ dreams.” 
Upon hearing the term “Southern Lord.” 
The Dream Demon’s pupil shrank into a dot, staring intently at Lin Tian, “A small goblin like you dares to talk about making me the Southern Lord?” 
“Hmph, the golden iguana you couldn’t defeat for years was annihilated by him.” The Cannibal Eagle taunted at this moment. 
The Dream Demon found it hard to believe but gave some credence to the Cannibal Eagle’s words, “Hahaha! I’m very willing. Tell me, whose sweet dream do you want me to control?” 
“No one special, just a human.” Lin Tian said nonchalantly. 
The Dream Demon readily agreed, “Good! Hahaha…” 
The long sinister laugh echoed through the thorny forest. 
The Cannibal Eagle then said, “I’ll go report to the Great Tomb. Are you sure you want him as the Southern Lord? Don’t underestimate him because the Iguana Lord. If you fought him in the south, you wouldn’t have stood a chance.” 
He implied that the lord could summon a large number of monsters as helpers. 
That was the real strength. 
Lin Tian suddenly raised his hand, “Lord Cannibal Eagle, let’s wait a bit. I have a new plan.” 
Hearing this, the Dream Demon retreated a few steps warily! 
Sensing a threat, “What are you planning?” 
“Little Tian, the Dream Demon is a spiritual entity. You can’t devour its abilities. If you turn against it, there will be no cooperation.” 
The Cannibal Eagle, understanding goblin methods. 
He guessed Lin Tian’s intentions. 
However, Lin Tian ignored him, checking the Dream Demon’s attribute panel. 
Indeed, an ordinary goblin couldn’t devour it, but Lin Tian still had another skill. 
‘Abnormal Fusion.’
