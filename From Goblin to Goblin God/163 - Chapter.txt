Chapter 163: The Request of the Snake-people Tribe 
TL: Sungmin 
Finally, 
Riding the wyvern, Lin Tian arrived within the Goblin Empire. 
On the walls of the royal city. 
A few goblins, upon recognizing Lin Tian, excitedly waved their hands and danced, shouting, “Boss! The Boss is back!” 
“Long live the Boss!” 
This amusing and symbolic scene made Lin Tian feel nostalgic—it had been a long time since he last saw it. 
The goblins, not used to calling him “king,” all referred to Lin Tian as “Boss.” 
After all, goblins had never established a kingdom in history. 
Lin Tian flew directly toward the kingdom’s plaza, where Alice, Gobu Kuang, Gobu Yue, and the others were all waiting to welcome him. 
Their enhanced strength allowed them to hear the familiar sound of wyvern wings from a distance. 
“Welcome, welcome! A warm welcome to the Boss!” 
Gobu Yue, like a little girl, couldn’t close her mouth from smiling, so happy she was. 
She held a wreath and placed it on Lin Tian’s head. 
Gobu Kuang and the others were equally excited, despite their intelligence having grown considerably. 
They all retained their most primal emotions. 
This was what set them apart from humans. 
Humans, as their status, identity, and age grew, often became increasingly indifferent. 
But goblins were different; they didn’t have those emotions tied to saving face. 
They waved their hands and danced, fully expressing their joy. 
Lin Tian was also in a good mood but said, “Gobu Yue, you’re making it seem like I just returned from a war.” 
“Blah, blah, blah! It’s been almost half a month since I last saw you, isn’t it okay to miss you?” Gobu Yue stuck out her little tongue as she spoke. 
At this moment, Alice spoke solemnly, “Messenger, according to your instructions, we have captured the major cities of the Sword Kingdom and the Magic Kingdom. As for the remaining small towns, they are insignificant, so we haven’t attacked them yet. The main forces are stationed in other important strategic towns.” 
The Magic Kingdom, though divided into Clover and Shamrock factions, was essentially one city with two kings. 
There wasn’t much difference between them. 
Lin Tian was quite satisfied but still said, “Alice, my comrade, there’s no need to be so serious on an occasion like this. Let’s enjoy ourselves a bit; I’ve gained a lot from this trip, so let’s celebrate today.” 
But Alice remained just as serious. “Messenger, after the celebration, you should still take a look at the captured Child of the Evil God, who is, after all, your child.” 
Upon hearing this. 
Lin Tian’s expression also turned serious. “Did you capture him? That guy must have been tough to deal with.” 
“Indeed, after devouring hundreds of thousands of people, his body grew to a height of a hundred meters. He even attracted the aberrant Evil God. It was thanks to Sylph’s sealing magic that we managed to capture him.” 
As Alice explained, she recounted the entire process. 
Lin Tian was somewhat surprised. “Impressive, Alice, my comrade! Even the Wind Spirit has contracted with you. However, we must indeed be wary of that Atoreya fellow.” 
Although Sylph advocated for peace. 
Compared to the threat posed by the goblins, she would rather sacrifice herself to suppress Atoreya. If he were to revive, the consequences would be unimaginable. 
Darkspawn had the power to awaken other deceased Darkspawn. 
One could become two, two could become three; just one was terrifying, but a group would bring endless suffering to the world. 
Immediately, Alice instructed Sylph to undo the sealing magic and release the Child of the Evil God. 
Sylph, however, resisted strongly. “If he is released, he might escape and attract aberrant entities once again.” 
“Don’t worry; just aim the exit toward this magic array,” Lin Tian said. 
He had already asked Cassandra to cast holy sealing magic, with Ifreya’s help. 
Even at her peak, Veronica would find it difficult to escape. 
Looking at the magnificent five-layered magic array before him, Sylph finally felt assured and began to lift the seal. 
Because she had been maintaining the seal, it continuously consumed her strength. 
From the pitch-black sealing array, the Child of the Evil God burst out frantically! 
“Save me, Father, Mother!” 
But as soon as he emerged, he was bound tightly by golden magic chains. 
He couldn’t move. 
The Child of the Evil God, filled with fear, looked around, emitting a piercing, chilling cry, “Save me, Mother! I am your child! Can you feel my presence?” 
Even Veronica, in the dungeon, sensed it. “An aberrant? And an extremely powerful one at that. Has the Black Goat Spawn really hatched into a new aberrant?” 
The more she thought about it, the more terrifying she found that goblin. 
Lin Tian, sensing that the situation was deteriorating, hurriedly said, “Little one, look at me! I am your father! Stop this nonsense!” 
If this continued, it would be disastrous if the Black Goat Mother Goddess were drawn out. 
According to Alice, that Evil God’s power was on a level of overwhelming devastation. 
Upon hearing this. 
The Child of the Evil God examined Lin Tian with his eerie striped eyes. “You are not my father! How could I have a father like you?” 
“Smack!” 
Lin Tian slapped him across the face on the spot. 
A rebellious son needed to be disciplined. 
Discipline produced filial piety. 
As he spoke, he pulled out the Spear of Zeus and began electrocuting him without mercy. 
Seeing this. 
Alice and the others were very puzzled. “Messenger, why can you keep looking at this creature without your mental strength being affected?” 
This question suddenly made Lin Tian realize something. 
He hadn’t even noticed it himself. 
He remembered that Rebecca had gone completely mad after just a few glances. 
Now, he had been staring at it for quite some time, and had even beaten it to the point where it was trembling on the ground. 
The Child of the Evil God also noticed this and, convinced, said, “Alright, alright, Father, I acknowledge that you are my father. I won’t dare argue with you anymore.” 
Seeing its sincere plea for mercy, Lin Tian was finally satisfied. “Hmph, be obedient from now on, got it?” 
“Mm, mm, mm! But, Father, could you release me? It’s really uncomfortable and painful like this…” The Child of the Evil God nodded vigorously, speaking pitifully. 
But Lin Tian didn’t agree. 
This guy seemed very cunning and was a significant threat. If he turned hostile and didn’t recognize anyone, without the undead army, this city might be destroyed. 
For now, Lin Tian could only temporarily imprison him. “Because of your special nature, I can only keep you sealed here for the time being. But remember, no shouting or making a fuss. I’ll take care of your food needs as well.” 
“When will you let me out, Father?” the Child of the Evil God asked, confused. 
Lin Tian thought for a moment. It was indeed a tricky situation, and he didn’t dare release him lightly. 
He had originally thought of using him when attacking the War Empire. 
But now, that idea had to be put aside. 
He could only say, “Soon. I’ll come to visit you every day, and I’ll even find you some playmates. Just stay here peacefully.” 
The Child of the Evil God became very quiet and nodded vigorously. 
He seemed like a really well-behaved child now, very obedient. 
Lin Tian felt relieved. “Alright, let’s go. Let’s relax for a bit.” 
“Boss, about relaxing, you might want to hold off for a moment. Over the past few days, we’ve received over a dozen demi-human leaders who want to join the empire,” Gobu Yue said helplessly from the side. 
They didn’t have the final say, so they temporarily arranged for those demi-human leaders to stay within the empire, waiting for Lin Tian to return and resolve the matter. 
Alice also spoke up, “We haven’t dealt with the issues of the Sword Kingdom and the Magic Kingdom either.” 
“Damn, are they trying to work me to death?” Lin Tian felt exhausted. 
Helplessly, he said, “Round up the people of those two kingdoms and use them as food for the Child of the Evil God. Doesn’t he need a large amount of flesh and blood?” 
Sylph immediately rushed out, a fierce wind rising. “You demon! Lunatic! What are you saying? Four or five million people, to be used as food for an aberration?” 
“Father! Thank you! That’s wonderful!” The Child of the Evil God licked his lips greedily from the side. 
But Sylph, as an elemental spirit who advocated for world peace, could not stand by and watch such a thing happen. 
She even questioned Alice, “Are you really willing to associate with such a demon?” 
“I don’t know if he’s a demon, but the gods have told me that what he does is right,” Alice replied with an indifferent expression, her voice full of unwavering conviction. 
Lin Tian coldly retorted, “Then what do you suggest? Let them live with the monsters? Do you think that’s possible?” 
“This…” 
Sylph was momentarily at a loss for words. 
But soon, she seemed to calm down. “Fine, perhaps I’ve spent too much time living among humans, so I feel empathy for them. The struggle between monsters and humans is just how it is.” 
Remembering past memories, she suddenly felt relieved. 
Humans had also slaughtered monsters in large numbers, even organizing a century-long monster-cleansing coalition. 
During that time, monsters were nearly wiped out. 
The current variety of demi-humans numbered only a few thousand. 
There had once been tens of thousands of species, with 80% being driven to extinction. 
Peace. 
It was the peace of the world. As long as the situation remained under control, that was enough. 
“I knew it. It would have been strange if you didn’t understand me,” Lin Tian said calmly. 
Sylph had previously been able to decisively leave Edward because she hadn’t developed deep feelings for the Sword Kingdom or Edward. 
Compared to world peace, nothing else mattered. 
Lin Tian then instructed, “Alice, take me to meet the other demi-human leaders.” 
“Mm.” 
Gobu Yue led the way, speaking as she did. “These demi-humans look really strange. There are snake-people, catgirls, rabbitfolk, swan-people, and so on. I never knew there were such amazing races before!” 
They quickly arrived at the area where the centaurs were located. 
Most of the demi-humans had been arranged to stay in this area. 
Seeing Lin Tian, Fiona quickly came forward to greet him. “Goblin Majesty, you’ve returned.” 
“Mm. Where are the other demi-human leaders? I suppose you’ve gotten to know them well by now,” Lin Tian said as he glanced around. 
Mostly centaurs were moving about or caring for their pregnant members. 
All of these centaurs were now carrying hybrid offspring, and it wouldn’t be long before they gave birth. 
Fiona pointed to a few wooden houses ahead. “They’re resting there. I’ll take you to them. There’s no need to trouble yourself, Princess Gobu Yue.” 
“No worries. I like being with the Boss,” Gobu Yue said with a giggle. 
Following her lead, they arrived at one of the wooden houses. Fiona knocked on the door, “Chief Louise, His Majesty the Goblin has returned. Please come out.” 
Suddenly, there was a clattering noise from inside. 
It sounded like something had shattered. 
A white-haired woman, dressed in a thin gauzy robe, opened the door to greet them, forcing a smile. “I’m here, I’m here.” 
There was a hint of panic on her fair face. 
Hearing that Lin Tian had arrived, she seemed momentarily at a loss.
