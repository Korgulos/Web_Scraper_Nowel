Chapter 96: Snowfield Lord, Snow Spirit 
TL: Sungmin  
The Spear of Zeus was suddenly hurled into the lake! 
“Sizzle!!!” 
“Boom!” 
Intense high-voltage lightning surged through the lake! 
The blinding white light made it impossible to keep one’s eyes open! 
A bolt of lightning as thick as a bowl descended from the sky! 
It exploded directly in the lake! 
Waves surged high! 
Even Alice found it hard to believe, “Another world-class magical tool? But such power…” 
The lake, spanning dozens of miles, was now covered with the corpses of magical creatures. 
No creature inside was likely to have survived. 
“Lord!” 
“It’s over. I thought he could escape. What is this goblin? Why is he so terrifying?” 
“The power of thunder, a goblin, impossible!” 
Some of the water demons were on the verge of madness, trembling as they looked at the corpses of their kin scattered everywhere. 
In no time, the Water Demon Lord also floated to the surface of the lake. 
His body was charred, his eyes white, barely alive. 
Lin Tian snorted, “I don’t know if you’re lucky or unlucky. In the water, you had nowhere to escape, but it also diluted the power of the lightning.” 
Otherwise, a single strike would have finished him off. 
After being unconscious for a long time, the Water Demon Lord finally woke up. 
The surroundings were very warm and comfortable, but he found that he couldn’t move his body, as if paralyzed. 
When he saw everything clearly, he almost collapsed! 
The warmth was due to a bonfire roasting water demons. 
Some were even being roasted alive, their heart-wrenching screams chilling to the bone. 
“Lord! Save me!” 
A water demon, seeing him awake, cried out in tears. 
He was being skewered by Gobu Shan and placed on the fire. 
The Water Demon Lord panted heavily, on the brink of emotional collapse. Before him, on the fire racks, were his brother, father, and other elders! 
The roasting made their bodies sizzle and drip with oil. 
Lin Tian was enjoying the feast, “Not bad, the taste is similar to fish but more delicate, and the meat around the waist is the best, just like fish belly.” 
As he spoke, he tore off a piece of fish belly meat, placing it in his mouth where it melted gently. 
The fragrance lingered on his lips and teeth. 
Seeing this horrifying scene, the Water Demon Lord shivered, “Beasts! A bunch of damned goblins! What are you doing! Give my family’s lives back!!!” 
“Oh? You’re awake?” Lin Tian grinned eerily, still gnawing on a water demon’s head, his mouth greasy. 
The Water Demon Lord felt like he was suffocating, not from lack of water, but from lack of oxygen, gritting his teeth in hatred. 
However, Gobu Shan approached with a roasted, fragrant little water demon. 
He held it to the Lord’s mouth, “Do you know what this is?” 
“Damned goblin!!!” 
The Water Demon Lord screamed hysterically, his eyes trembling with hatred, veins bulging on his forehead! 
Eating was one thing, but to make him eat his own child! 
The Cannibal Eagle sat beside him. He had certainly sought revenge but had never imagined going to such lengths. 
Perhaps, this was what goblins were. 
However, he did not sympathize, and said, “Hmph, what about when you and the Northern Lord were killing my kin! You reap what you sow!” 
“I…” 
The Water Demon Lord was momentarily speechless, filled only with endless regret and anger. 
But when he turned his head, he saw many female water demons tied up. 
He questioned, “Why did you capture them too? Don’t go too far. If you have the guts, wipe out my entire water demon clan!” 
“Don’t worry, I won’t do that. They have other uses.” 
Lin Tian said casually, a mischievous smile on his face. 
If these female water demons weren’t so ugly, he would have dealt with them on the spot. 
Even Gobu Kuang and the others had no interest in them. 
They could only take them back as breeding tools. 
The Water Demon Lord seemed to realize something, “I beg you, Lord Goblin, please spare my remaining people! They have nothing to do with this. Punish me instead!” 
“Admitting fault, huh? I don’t have such words in my vocabulary.” Lin Tian continued to eat the roasted meat. 
Only the Water Demon Lord’s painful cries and apologies to his people filled the air. 
His eyes were filled with fear of the goblins. 
His understanding of this race had been refreshed. 
He deeply experienced their cruelty and ruthless violence. 
The Water Demon Lord gritted his teeth in hatred, “I swear, I will slaughter all of you one day!!!” 
As long as he lived, he would have a chance for revenge. 
His own strength was insufficient, but his relatives in the ocean were enough to crush the goblins. 
Water demons were a variant of sea demons, accustomed to living in freshwater. 
Their characteristic was that they became stronger in the rain. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but be curious, “Who gave you the illusion that you could survive?” 
The Water Demon Lord was also stunned, then confidently said, “Do you dare kill me? I was personally appointed by the Demon Lord as the Western Lord. The Golden Iguana is nothing compared to me!” 
The Cannibal Eagle whispered, “Little Tian, fighting between lords in the Great Tomb is actually forbidden, unless you are not a lord, then you can challenge.” 
Because this kind of situation could likely develop into internal strife within the Great Tomb, rather than a simple conflict between lords. 
There once was a tenth-tier lord who tried to annex other lords to become the Grand Lord. 
As a result, the Bone King sent someone to eliminate him directly. 
Now, this could only be considered a lesson and a conflict, but killing the Water Demon Lord would make the situation serious. 
However, Lin Tian gestured with his hand, “It’s fine, I have a plan. When the time comes, I’ll make sure you die in utter despair.” 
Even if the Water Demon Lord complained to the Bone King, Lin Tian wouldn’t be worried in the slightest. 
He was currently an indispensable pawn in the Bone King’s hands. 
Anyone could die, but he couldn’t. 
“Are you full? It’s time to let that guy in the north taste what regret feels like.” 
Lin Tian’s eyes gleamed with cold light. 
He intended to eliminate these rebellious individuals immediately, to prevent any backstabbing during critical moments of the great battle. 
He didn’t rule out the possibility of such a scenario. 
He didn’t want any problems to arise in his plans. 
Soon, everyone began to move north, while Gobu Shan took the water demons back to the tribe. 
They would be kept as breeding tools. 
The Water Demon Lord wasn’t killed; he was handed over to the Cannibal Eagle’s tribe for handling. 
… 
The Great Tomb spanned several thousand kilometers, with the northern region perpetually covered in snow and extremely cold temperatures. 
The vast snowy plains seemed endless at a glance. 
It was hard to distinguish anything. 
It was easy to get lost here, and with few magical creatures around, most were hiding. 
Those who weren’t frozen to death starved to death. 
The cold wind howled by their ears, and even Lin Tian couldn’t help but shiver, “Damn, it’s my first time seeing snow.” 
“Brr, boss, it’s so cold I feel like my teeth are about to shatter.” 
Gobu Kuang’s teeth were chattering so much they made a constant clattering sound. 
The temperature was indeed too low to continue. Goblins didn’t have fur and rarely wore clothes. 
Even the Cannibal Eagle, covered in thick fur, couldn’t stand it, and said helplessly, “Maybe we should give up for now. We can act when he leaves the north.” 
“No need, and time waits for no one.” 
Lin Tian took out a magical tool. 
‘Heart of Apollo,’ a world-class magical tool. 
It looked like a small sun, floating in his palm. 
It could emit temperatures as high as the sun, up to thousands of degrees, with an effective range of ten meters, enough to melt anything close by without harming the user. 
Lin Tian carefully controlled the temperature, adjusting it to a few hundred degrees to fend off the freezing cold of minus tens of degrees. 
This made the surroundings warm enough. 
Everyone was surprised. 
Alice couldn’t help but ask curiously, “Messenger, how many magical tools did you get from the dwarves?” 
“Well, enough to use.” 
Lin Tian didn’t give a direct answer, deflecting the question. 
An innocent man holding a jade was guilty. He didn’t yet have the strength to protect these items. 
When he left the Great Tomb for the unknown empire where the dwarves were located, 
Lin Tian realized that powerful entities weren’t just in the Great Tomb and the Church. 
There were many even stronger. 
After all, the Lionheart Empire had only been established for a few decades. 
There were only a few powerful figures, with Alice being one of them. 
What about those empires that had lasted for hundreds or thousands of years? They must be full of hidden talents. 
Under the protection of the Heart of Apollo, everyone felt warm. 
However, finding the Northern Lord, the ‘Red-haired Yeti,’ was not easy. 
He was the only one of the four lords who didn’t have a clan system and lived alone. 
His strength was unknown. 
Lin Tian once again used the Grand Lord’s ‘call’ skill, instructing all the magical creatures in the area to find the Red-haired Yeti’s whereabouts. 
The previously calm snowy plains began to stir, with various magical creatures emerging from the snow. 
Giant rats covered in fur, naive-looking three-tailed hidden foxes, phantom snow owls with eyes like searchlights, and many others. 
“We just need to wait. Being a Grand Lord is convenient; you can command magical creatures anywhere.” The Cannibal Eagle sighed. 
In such a short time, Lin Tian had grown to this extent. 
He shattered the long-held stereotype of goblins being stupid and inferior. 
Previously, even high-tier variants were still seen as goblins, despised and loathed by everyone. 
Time passed gradually. 
Finally, a magical creature flew toward them. 
It had tiny, crystalline wings and a small body no larger than a palm, with snow-white skin and limbs. 
A snow spirit. 
However, its originally cute little face was bruised, and its body had some bruises as well. 
It looked very pitiful. 
“Grand Lord, I know where the Red-haired Yeti is…” 
As it spoke, the snow spirit almost collapsed from exhaustion. 
Lia quickly held it in her hand, pouring some homemade recovery potion on it. 
Gradually, it recovered, “Follow me, he’s in a cave.” 
This snow spirit was a high-intelligence species and could choose not to obey Lin Tian’s summons. 
But oppressed by the Red-haired Yeti for a long time, it decided to rebel. 
“Worm! Get over here! Do you want another beating? This time I’ll beat you to death! Even if you can revive, I’ll kill you again!” 
A booming voice came from a huge cave. 
The deafening roar caused a large pile of snow to fall from the cave entrance. 
When a blizzard lasted for several months without stopping, it would give birth to magical creatures like snow spirits, who could revive after dying during the blizzard. 
Their greatest function was producing snow crystals, which contained extremely strong magical power. 
Magical creatures could consume them to level up. 
In the human world, they were also excellent ornaments and luxury goods. 
For decades, the Red-haired Yeti had enslaved snow spirits, eating many snow crystals. 
Lin Tian and his group felt the violent magical aura emanating from inside but fearlessly walked in.
