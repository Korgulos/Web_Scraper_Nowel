Chapter 150: Silent Slaughter! 
TL: Sungmin 
Lin Tian pondered. 
The life of the One-Eyed Owl had stabilized, so he didn’t worry about it dying and it didn’t need any special care. 
Therefore, he thought about tagging along to check out the commotion and understand the situation of the War Empire. 
However, going there might mean he wouldn’t come back. 
But if he just watched from the side, he probably wouldn’t get himself involved. 
Lin Tian also stepped into the teleportation light curtain. “Count me in!” 
Seeing this, Osius straightforwardly said, “Are you that stubborn? Last time you insisted on going back with Big Sis, and this time it’s much more serious. You’re likely to die in the royal city!” 
Even if they slaughtered the Landau family, they would be besieged by the War Empire. 
That’s why he said that. 
But Lin Tian still stepped in, jokingly saying, “I’m so weak, they definitely wouldn’t think I’m from the Dragon Slayer Guild. They shouldn’t kill me.” 
Though his tone was joking, it was indeed a plausible way to get out of trouble. 
And he believed no one from the Dragon Slayer Guild would give him away. 
So, it was okay to go. 
“You kid?!” 
“Hahaha, although you’re not very strong, I admire your courage!” 
“Alright, I’ll show you the world today! Later, you can boast about having broken into the War Empire’s royal city, haha!” 
The people with Grugia were slightly surprised but smiled in satisfaction. 
They teased Lin Tian, but this joke made them feel at ease, letting him follow along. 
Then, the teleportation began! 
A blinding light covered everyone’s sight, and their bodies felt as if they were being pulled out of this world, weightless, with a sense of falling. 
Those with weak hearts shouldn’t try it easily. 
Before them lay a vast, empty land, the dusk light spreading across the horizon, gilding the world with a layer of gold. 
Lin Tian looked around. 
He found himself already on a tall tower. 
There were many soldiers guarding the place, along with mages in black cloaks. 
This was one of the teleportation points in the War Empire’s royal city. 
“Welcome, members of the Dragon Slayer Guild! What brings so many of you here at once?” The captain of the soldiers smiled, but his left hand remained on the long sword at his waist. 
Grugia smiled politely, “Locke, long time no see.” 
“Marquis Grugia, long time no see!” Captain Locke immediately stood at attention and bowed. 
Hearing this, Grugia just gave a dry laugh. “Heh, I’m no longer a marquis. Alright, I’m here to shop with the guild members. You can go about your business.” 
Then, he led the group away from the teleportation point and headed into the city. 
The captain didn’t say much more. 
Due to Grugia’s former status, he didn’t send anyone to follow them. 
This city was much larger than Lion King City, with many grand buildings and a rich historical atmosphere. 
Bell towers, temples, and more. 
The streets were bustling with people of all kinds. 
The familiar calls of street vendors felt quite endearing. 
Following the team, Lin Tian couldn’t help but step forward and ask, “Brother, that captain just now called you a marquis? Are you a noble of this country?” 
Noble titles ranged from viscount, baron, count, marquis, to duke. 
A duke was the highest, equivalent to a prince, just below the king. 
However, it was just a noble status, not a position. 
Military positions included commanders, knight captains, captains, and so on. 
These were actual positions. 
Hearing this, Grugia’s face turned gloomy, and he didn’t answer. 
Osius, beside him, explained cheerfully, “Surprised, huh? He was indeed a noble of the War Empire before, but after the Titan Experiment Plan failed, he became despondent. 
After witnessing Big Sis’s elegant hunting of monsters, he pulled himself together and joined the Dragon Slayer Guild.” 
Lin Tian looked bewildered. “Titan Experiment Plan?” 
“The War Empire unearthed a piece of ancient titan remains and, with the help of alchemists and mages, created a forbidden magic, the ‘Titan Gene Magic Array,’ to conduct titan modification experiments on humans. 
Those who underwent the modification either died or gained varying degrees of titan genes. The stronger the genes, the greater the power, resulting in a drastic change in strength. 
Grugia, here, spent his entire fortune, and his family was persecuted to death by his rivals, to secure a spot for the modification. Unfortunately, he failed. Otherwise, he would’ve been quite prestigious, possibly a duke by now.” Osius spoke with a heavy tone. 
He felt sorry for him too. 
Though they usually teased each other without care, he was considerate about this matter since Grugia had lost his family. 
Grugia self-deprecatingly laughed. “What marquis or duke? It’s much more comfortable living in the guild. Drink when you want to drink, fight when you want to fight, and be accompanied by beauties like Big Sis. So much more enjoyable, hahaha!” 
“You! Only dare to boast when Big Sis is resting.” Osius retorted, exasperated. 
The group started teasing him. 
Lin Tian found it hard to believe they were heading towards a battle to the death! 
No one was scared at all. 
Seeing that everyone was about to lose their temper, Grugia said sternly, “Enough, we’re almost at the Landau family’s palace. Everyone, stay alert.” 
Soon. 
The group arrived in front of a magnificent palace. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but feel that his own palace was rather shabby in comparison, not as grand as this noble’s mansion! 
The gate alone was made of pure white marble, standing ten meters high and seven meters wide! 
The courtyard walls were made of finely polished, milky white stone bricks. 
Even through the walls, he could see the varied rooftops of numerous buildings inside. 
It was at least an entire complex! 
It was hard to believe it belonged to just one family! 
Grugia and the others could hardly contain their anger. “Rookie, stay back. We’re about to get down to business!” 
“Open the door!!!” 
Immediately, Osius began pounding on the massive marble gate with all his might. 
A thunderous noise echoed. 
Lin Tian nodded and climbed onto the rooftop of a nearby building. 
He saw a man running towards the gate from inside. 
“Boom!!” 
Suddenly, the gate was forcibly pushed down by Grugia and the others, crushing the man who was trying to open it into a pulp! 
The massive gate fell, raising a cloud of dust that obscured the view of the courtyard. 
Inside the splendid palace, more than ten people rushed out, their faces filled with confusion. 
But the chaotic dust made it impossible for them to see what was happening. 
In the next second. 
Grugia dashed through the fountain in the center of the courtyard like a meteor, appearing beside those people. 
“You!” 
The group hadn’t even reacted. 
Blood sprayed onto the threshold, flowing down the steps to the courtyard. 
Grugia’s spear in his hand cut through the group like slicing vegetables, leaving them all in pieces. 
With his face covered in blood, he charged inside, shouting, “Duke Landau! Come out and die!!!” 
“Kill!” 
The members of the Dragon Slayer Guild behind him went berserk, killing anyone they saw. 
If they didn’t see anyone, they destroyed buildings. 
In an instant, flames and explosions erupted everywhere! 
The nearby residents and passersby around the Landau family palace fled in panic. 
Time was of the essence. 
Grugia and his group, driven mad by bloodlust, didn’t give anyone in the palace a chance to speak. 
Anyone they saw was chopped into pieces. 
Outside, no one could tell that a massive slaughter was taking place inside. 
Because not a single scream was heard. 
Only the wind carried the thick scent of blood away.
