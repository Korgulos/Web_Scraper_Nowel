Chapter 151: Fischer, Demon King! 
“You! What are you doing? Why are you attacking us?” 
“We are nobles! Stop this!” 
“Help, where are the soldiers? Someone save me!” 
Inside the magnificent palace, the stronger members of the Landau family could manage a few last words, but even here, their voices could not carry beyond these walls. There was only the massacre at hand. 
“Ah! Let go! What are you doing?” 
Grugia grabbed a blonde woman’s hair and tossed her from the second floor of the palace hall. The woman screamed in pain; she was none other than the wife of Duke Landau. 
At the same time, Osius and the others dragged out several men and women from the rooms, some young, some old. They were all members of the Landau family—children, parents, elders—who were thrown from the second floor like garbage. 
One by one, their weak bodies either broke bones or lost consciousness upon impact. But without exception, they were all terrified to the core, trembling uncontrollably! 
Landau’s father suddenly recognized Grugia and shouted, “Grugia? What are you doing? The Empire won’t let you get away with this!” 
“What am I doing? I’m making sure you die knowing exactly why! You should never have plotted to kill Elizabeth Tilly!” 
Grugia spoke with a ferocious expression, standing above them. Fresh blood from the Landau family still warm on his face, emanated a strong aura of death that struck fear into the hearts of those below. They knew they were going to die. 
Members of the Dragon Slayer Guild stood on the second floor, glaring down at them with extreme hatred. Though none of them could match the One-Eyed Owl, as followers, they had long been prepared to give their lives for her. 
Below, a child let out a piercing cry, perhaps sensing the imminent threat of death. A woman hurriedly held the child close, trembling with fear. Despair, helplessness, and deep regret filled the air. 
“Ahhhh… I told you we shouldn’t have provoked the Dragon Slayer Guild, why did you insist on doing it!!” Landau’s father cried out in agony, his sagging, wrinkled face trembling. 
He quickly turned his head and pleaded, “Grugia, we can help you restore your Marquis title if you just spare us, please?” 
“Hmph.” Grugia only snorted coldly, then turned his head and asked, “Have you found Landau yet?” 
“Not yet, it seems… he’s not here at all,” Osius and the others replied in a panic, having searched the entire palace. 
Grugia frowned and looked down. “Tell me where Landau is, and I’ll give you a quick death.” 
“Madman! This is the royal city!” Landau’s wife screamed. 
Grugia did not respond. “I’ll ask you one last time…” 
“Please, if you can spare…” 
Landau’s father knelt on the ground, but before he could finish his plea, a sharp dagger was thrown down, piercing his skull with precision. His body collapsed like a machine that had lost its command. 
Landau’s wife watched as blood flowed from the wound, streaming out between the dagger and her husband’s skull. She screamed in terror. 
“Thud!” 
Another dagger was thrown, killing her instantly. 
“Swish, swish, swish!” 
The members of the Dragon Slayer Guild furiously hurled daggers, turning the people below into pincushions. They died in agony, writhing in their own foul-smelling blood. 
The scene on the first floor of the palace resembled hell itself. Cold daggers stuck out from the twisted corpses strewn everywhere. Blood flowed across the hall’s floor and out the door. 
Yet, even this failed to satisfy the Dragon Slayer Guild members’ thirst for vengeance. 
Grugia’s expression darkened. “Landau isn’t here. We’ve lost our chance…” 
They had acted too impulsively, failing to confirm his whereabouts beforehand. Now, there was no chance to kill him; soldiers would soon surround them. 
Osius, still burning with rage and covered in the blood of the Landau family, gritted his teeth and said, “So what! Wherever he is, we’ll hunt him down! The War Empire won’t react fast enough to stop us!” 
“That’s right! As long as we’re avenging the Boss, dying on the path of vengeance is worth it!” 
“Hahaha, I’ve been a dead man for a long time. The only thing driving me is killing!” 
“From the moment I joined the Dragon Slayer Guild, I never expected to die peacefully!” 
The others spoke in agreement, unfazed. 
With that, Grugia unleashed a powerful aura, “Alright, alright! You guys head out first, I’m going to destroy this palace!” 
His muscles began to twitch and swell, his body rapidly growing in size. In the blink of an eye, he burst through the entire palace, standing over twenty meters tall! 
His muscles swelled all over his body. Though he had been bald, now brown, unruly hair sprouted along with a thick beard. He looked a bit like a rugged Viking. This was the effect brought about by the Titan gene. 
With a single wave of his hand, he smashed the luxurious palace into ruins! 
Upon seeing this, a squad of patrolling soldiers hurried over. But when they realized it was a Titan causing the destruction, they turned and fled in terror, only able to call for the soldier captain. 
“Marquis Grugia! What are you doing? Stop this at once!” the soldier captain shouted from the rooftop of a tall building, his expression grave. However, his words did nothing to halt Grugia. 
Grugia ignored him entirely. “We’re leaving, let’s go find that bastard Landau!” 
“Ah!!! My palace! My family!” A pitiful cry rang out at that moment. 
Landau appeared on the street, dressed in a gray-black formal suit, looking to be in his late thirties or early forties. The scene before him nearly broke him completely. He clutched his long red hair with both hands, collapsing to the ground, weeping in utter despair. 
He had just gone to the royal palace for some business, never imagining that his home would be attacked while he was away—and by people he knew. 
Landau stood up, gnashing his teeth. “Grugia! I’m going to kill you!!!” 
“Hmm?!” Upon hearing this, Grugia’s expression shifted, the sound he made rumbling like thunder, echoing through the surroundings. He slowly turned his head. 
When he saw that it was Landau, he raged, “Long time no see, Your Grace. You want to kill me? We of the Dragon Slayer Guild will make sure you die first!” 
“Why! Why did you kill my entire family?!” Landau screamed in agony, tearing out clumps of his own hair. 
Osius and the others immediately surrounded him. “Why? Because you dared to harm our Boss, so you have to die!” 
For a moment, Landau froze, surprised that he had been exposed. Then he let out a crazed laugh. “Hmph, a bunch of unruly savage lunatics. The empire has long wanted to deal with you. Now it seems they’ve succeeded, huh…” 
“You’re sorely mistaken. Our Boss is doing just fine!” Osius coldly stared him down. 
Landau’s brow furrowed. “What? Those useless Ironhorns… But with how crazed you all are, that woman must be crippled by now, right? Hahaha!” 
Hearing his laugh, Osius and the others could no longer contain their anger. They prepared to rush forward and tear him apart on the spot. 
But just then, they felt a terrifying power erupt in the distance! 
“Sizzle, sizzle!!!” 
Golden lightning descended from the sky, accompanied by the deafening roars of Titan giants! 
Three giants charged from the distant street, each towering over Grugia by several meters, but otherwise sharing similar features. 
These were the War Empire’s three perfect Titan warriors! 
Lin Tian looked up, and a powerful visual impact struck his mind. They were massive! Every step they took caused the ground to quake, and he could even see the fine details of their skin, the raised blood vessels, and the paths where their blood flowed. 
Landau stood before the three Titan giants, arms outstretched, his expression twisted with triumphant glee. He laughed maniacally, “Kekekeke! I will survive this with a smile on my face, and you all… will die!” 
He was utterly arrogant. Having lost everything—his family dead, his palace destroyed—he had gone mad. Now, all he wanted was to watch Osius and the others be slaughtered. 
“Roar!” At that moment, Grugia let out a furious roar and charged at the three giants, each of whom was a head taller than he was. 
“Bang!” He was instantly sent flying hundreds of meters away by a single kick, crushing a large swath of houses beneath him. It was clear he wouldn’t last long. 
Osius and the others shouted, “Kill that bastard!” 
“Ultimate Combat Skill · White Night Specter!” 
In an instant, Osius’s body began to blur, or rather, flicker rapidly. In the blink of an eye, he had charged right up to Landau. 
“World-Class Magic Tool · Fischer’s Death Eye!” 
Landau showed no fear, pulling out a crimson eye that unleashed a powerful black and red lightning, blasting Osius away. 
Moreover, the eye flew into the air, scanning the surroundings with eerie precision. It locked onto the numerous members of the Dragon Slayer Guild and began unleashing torrents of black blood-red lightning in a relentless assault! 
Anyone who entered its range would be automatically targeted, with no escape. Even long-range magic attacks were blocked or deflected. 
Osius’s expression turned grim. “Damn it, why does he have Fischer’s Eye? Is the Imperial family really pulling out all the stops?!” 
Fischer had been a Demon King-level powerhouse who once ruled over a region. It had taken a coalition of multiple nations to finally bring him down. Most of his body parts had been forged into magic tools, and this eye was one of them. 
“Come on then, without world-class skills, you think you can kill me? Dream on! Grugia will soon be dead, and then, you’ll all be crushed as well!” 
Landau sneered coldly, his eyes filled with contempt and arrogance. Meanwhile, Osius and the others were at a loss, seething with rage but feeling helpless. 
Suddenly, Osius steeled himself and shouted, “Everyone, if you’re tired of drinking contests, let’s see who can smash his head to bits first!” 
Without a second thought, he charged into the range of the Death Eye’s attacks! 
“Sizzle!” 
The scorching lightning burned and pierced Osius’s skin, shocking every inch of his body. The intense resistance made it nearly impossible to move forward. In just a few seconds, his clothes were reduced to ash, and his skin became charred and twisted, a sight too horrific to behold. 
“Damn it! There’s no way I’m letting you steal all the glory!” 
“If I can’t outdrink you, I sure as hell can outfight you! Charge!” 
“Hold up! Don’t rush ahead and die before us, would you? Hahaha!” 
A group of them, driven by madness, followed Osius’s lead! 
Countless bolts of lightning surged, turning the entire sky blood-red, creating an eerie and sinister atmosphere! 
Landau laughed disdainfully, “Perfect, I can wipe out you lunatics, you trash, all at once!” 
He felt a surge of twisted satisfaction, reveling in his perceived victory as the world-class magic tool decimated his foes. 
But from a distant rooftop, Lin Tian smiled coldly, pulling out the Spear of Zeus. “So you’re that good with a world-class magic tool? I prefer the most primitive method.” 
As luck would have it, a half-moon class magic tool could shatter a world-class one.<br/>
