Chapter 249: Endurance Lost! The Strongest Beast, the Soul Devourer! 
TL: Sungmin  
“Ah!” 
Suddenly. 
The tavern was once again interrupted by a woman’s scream, shattering the drunken haze of those present. 
Everyone shook their heads and sighed. “Sigh, what envy.” 
“If it’s His Majesty, the Goblin King, he might just survive an encounter with the Black Tiger Tribe.” 
“Too bad the Wild Rhino Tribe isn’t as powerful.” 
… 
Upstairs. 
Lin Tian looked at the shattered window where Scarlett had fled once again, letting out a deep breath, feeling utterly satisfied! 
“Congratulations to the host for gaining 300 Health, 100 Attack, 100 Defense.” 
The improvement this time was decent. 
If he could have ten or eight more like this, his stat panel would be able to crush others, gaining a substantial boost in combat power. 
However, the improvements weren’t limitless. It wasn’t as if every time he mated with someone with over ten thousand combat power, he would receive the same level of attribute enhancement. 
For example, if there were two angels. 
After mating with an angel with fifteen thousand combat power, he might gain a thousand Health, three hundred Attack, and three hundred Defense. 
But with a twenty-thousand combat power angel, the increase might only be around a hundred in attributes. 
The racial factor contributed more to the boost than combat power did. 
Of course, combat power wasn’t negligible either. The stronger the opponent, the greater the improvement. 
Regardless, after unlocking a race, future gains from mating with members of that race would become progressively smaller. 
Outside the imperial city. 
Scarlett’s eyes were filled with tears of pain. “Why! Why is this happening! It hurts so much! Could my body be sick?” 
For now, she set that thought aside and hurried to heal herself. 
But upon closer inspection, there were no signs of illness. 
It was simply strange. 
“It shouldn’t be possible. Even the Flower Fairy couldn’t seduce him? What kind of races has this Goblin experienced to become so calm and restrained?” 
After the pain subsided, Scarlett fell into deep confusion. 
She couldn’t understand why her Forbidden Soul Steal technique was still ineffective on Lin Tian. 
It seemed as if he had no interest whatsoever. 
Of course. 
Lin Tian was definitely interested, but at the last moment, he adjusted his focus, his mind purely set on getting revenge against Scarlett. 
Looking back at the Goblin King City. 
Scarlett grumbled furiously, “I refuse to believe it! Next time, I’ll make you truly fall in love with me! Leaving me will make you suffer!” 
The next day. 
Lin Tian sat as usual inside Tavern No. 7, waiting for Scarlett to come to him on her own. 
“Hm? Yesterday you looked over three meters tall and as sturdy as a bull, but why have you suddenly turned into a skinny dog?” 
Seeing the Wild Rhino Tribesman behind him, Lin Tian couldn’t help but ask curiously. 
The man’s sunken eyes made him look almost like a ghost. 
A lizardman nearby answered for him, “Your Majesty, this poor fool tried to copy you by chasing after girls and ended up like this after a woman from the Black Tiger Tribe got him. Sigh.” 
“What a tragedy.” 
Lin Tian shook his head. 
Then, he returned to sitting at the bar, continuing to wait. 
As expected, soon enough, an Octopus Girl slowly walked in, though she pretended to be reserved and didn’t engage with Lin Tian right away. 
When they saw the soft, slippery Octopus Girl with her many tentacles, the nearly-dead Wild Rhino Tribesman instantly revived with full energy! 
Their eyes locked onto her, fantasizing about what it might feel like to be wrapped in those tentacles. 
“What’s been going on these past few days? So many top-tier demi-human girls in the tavern!” 
“An Octopus Tribe member? From the deep sea, no less. What’s she doing here?” 
“She’s the dream of both men and women!” 
“If she were my wife, I’d die happy!” 
“I can’t even imagine how amazing that must feel!” 
Even the bunny girls were tempted to pursue her, because who could resist a husband with so many tentacles? 
Lin Tian’s heart was bursting with excitement! 
It was truly a stroke of luck! 
Without even leaving the tavern, he could experience the most extraordinary races across the entire continent. 
He was starting to fall for Scarlett. 
But when it was time to be cautious, Lin Tian knew he had to keep his cool, or he’d certainly die. 
This time, he decided to take the initiative and strike up a conversation. 
At first, Scarlett acted reluctant, but after some persistent persuasion, she finally agreed. 
What she really wanted was for Lin Tian to take the lead, as only then could she align with the conditions of desire. 
Only then could she steal his soul! 
That night. 
The sounds coming from upstairs were strange, yet they stirred the imagination and made blood boil. 
It was just the squirming noise of octopus tentacles wriggling. 
But everyone knew what was going on. 
The drinkers fell silent like obedient students, listening intently. 
After a long while. 
That familiar scream echoed out again. 
Scarlett had fled through the window once more. 
By the window. 
Lin Tian was thoroughly pleased. However, the combat power of the Octopus Tribe demi-humans was relatively low, so even though this was the first time unlocking them, the boost wasn’t significant. 
It was negligible. 
For the next seven days. 
Scarlett continued to arrive as promised. 
And each time, she fled in disgrace! 
Anyone else would have grown more haggard by the day, but Lin Tian’s complexion improved steadily with each passing day! 
After all, who wouldn’t be happy with such treatment? 
A good mood is the best indicator of well-being. 
Scarlett poured all her lifelong skills into serving Lin Tian, clearly harboring a deep desire to kill him. 
Yet, not once did she succeed. 
Instead, Lin Tian experienced top-tier service that even the mightiest gods had likely never felt! 
She truly lived up to the title of the Lust Demon King. In that particular aspect, she was simply unmatched. 
No other woman understood men’s pleasures the way she did. 
“Combat power of over nineteen thousand, almost twenty thousand… What can I say? I can’t bring myself to kill her. If she gives up, I’ll let it go as well.” 
Watching Scarlett flee once again, Lin Tian stood by the window, musing to himself. 
In the past, whenever he spared someone, it was always for some benefit he could continue extracting from them. 
But this time, it was genuine mercy—kindness from the depths of his heart. 
Another day passed. 
Scarlett arrived once again, as expected. 
But unsurprisingly, Lin Tian once again dominated her at the final critical moment, preventing her from succeeding. 
“Ssssss!” 
Holy-type attacks corroded her body, causing thick white smoke to rise. 
“Waaahhh! I… I want to be a good woman!” 
This time, instead of fleeing, Scarlett broke down into tears, revealing her true form. 
Lin Tian paused for a moment, pretending to be shocked. “You?! The Lust Demon King? Why is it you?” 
Scarlett slowly stood up, healing her wounds, her expression filled with malice. “Goblin! I’ve had enough! I’m going to kill you! I’ll just kill you outright!” 
After suffering so many humiliations, she was finally certain—her most prized power had absolutely no effect on Lin Tian. 
But that didn’t mean she was powerless. After all, how could she be one of the Lords of Sin? 
She held control over one-seventh of the resources in the Uninhabited Zone. 
“Roar!” 
At that moment, Scarlett transformed into the form of the strongest beast—the Soul Devourer! 
She could mimic anyone—man, woman, or any creature. 
Had it not been for her lustful nature, her title would have been the Demon King of Mimicry, rather than the Demon King of Lust. 
It was only her different approach to using her abilities that shaped her persona. 
Although the combat power of the Soul Devourer typically exceeded twenty thousand, Scarlett couldn’t fully unleash its potential. 
However, she focused on the demon’s combat skills and techniques, and with her base combat power of 19,999, it was more than enough. 
In actual combat, her power would be even stronger.
