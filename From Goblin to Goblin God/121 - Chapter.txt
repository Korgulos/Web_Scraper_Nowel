Chapter 121: Coalition, Three Hundred Thousand Strong Army! 
TL: Sungmin 
The next morning. 
Everyone felt unprecedentedly refreshed! 
They gathered in the square again, preparing to eat breakfast. 
As Goblin Slayer sliced bread, she sighed, “Lin Tian, why does it feel like you’ve gotten much stronger over these past few months?” 
“I feel the same, really!” Lia chimed in agreement. 
Gobu Yue’s face turned slightly red; she usually did not discuss such matters. 
She busied herself with her own tasks. 
Katheryn also approached, her legs trembling, “Good morning, everyone… good morning…” 
Seeing Lin Tian, she instinctively blushed and avoided his gaze. 
She didn’t dare look directly at him. 
Alice, on the other hand, stood silently nearby, acting as if nothing had happened. 
After preparing breakfast for thousands of goblins, Lin Tian instructed, “Gobu Kuang, call everyone to eat. From now on, they need to eat more carbs and meat for breakfast to become smarter and stronger.” 
Such strict regulations were necessary to change the combat capabilities of low-level goblins. 
Otherwise, even with high production, it would be a waste of resources if they were ineffective. 
“Where’s Gobu Kuang?” 
Lin Tian suddenly realized that Gobu Kuang was nowhere to be seen. 
In the distance, Gobu Tian shouted, “Over here!” 
Upon approaching, Lin Tian found Gobu Kuang curled up on the ground, his eyes filled with tears, “Boss, is there any meaning to my life anymore?” 
“Wow, you’ve even evolved to have suicidal thoughts.” 
Lin Tian didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He kicked Gobu Kuang lightly, “Stop complaining here, let’s go eat.” 
“Eat? Coming!” 
At the mention of food, Gobu Kuang’s eyes cleared up, and he was instantly rejuvenated. 
After breakfast, Lin Tian planned to officially reap the victory of the Lionheart Empire. 
He first instructed, “Your Holiness, take some of the residents to the towns and villages within the Lionheart Empire’s territory and explain the situation of the new empire.” 
Simply relying on the lord to relay the message wouldn’t work. 
Many people wouldn’t accept or believe it. 
He had to have the Holy Mother ride a dragon, with Alice, to convey the message. 
Taking Alice along was necessary; if anyone dared to cause trouble, they needed to eliminate the troublemaker immediately. 
“No problem.” 
Katheryn nodded and set off immediately. 
The sooner the propaganda, the better. Humans would accept it faster, allowing goblins to be deployed to various towns for breeding. 
A new round of strength expansion. 
As for the others, they went about their usual tasks. 
Lin Tian began the life simulation to predict the future trajectory of the Goblin Empire and skip the tedious waiting time. 
“System, start the life simulation.” 
[Life Simulation System starting. Current scenario: Establishing the Goblin Nation 
With your arduous efforts, you finally destroyed the Great Tomb and the Church, seizing the Lionheart Empire. 
Holy Mother Katheryn started spreading the word about the Goblin Empire and the conditions for coexisting with humans. 
The results were promising. Seeing the Holy Mother, the residents within the empire eventually agreed. 
However, unexpectedly, on the fourth day, the Sword Kingdom, the Clover Kingdom, and the Four-Leaf Clover Kingdom besieged the nascent Goblin Empire. 
Choice 1: Fight, Score 100 
Choice 2: Shut the gates and negotiate, Score 10 
Choice 3: Sense danger and flee, Score 0] 
Just as the simulation began, Lin Tian was startled by the sudden turn of events, “Damn, are you kidding me? I expected other empires to come, but why suddenly three?!” 
At this point, he had no choice but to choose to fight and see if he could gather information about the enemy’s forces. 
[Facing the human invasion, you chose to fight proudly. 
Unfortunately, no matter how strong you were, against a coalition of three hundred thousand troops, it was a futile struggle. 
After killing tens of thousands of enemies, your entire army was annihilated. 
The newly established Goblin Empire declared its fall.] 
Summary: Facing decisive enemies, you had no chance to breathe. 
Score: 20 out of 100 
Reward: Life Points x20 
This life simulation is complete, covering a time span of 4 days.] 
Upon seeing this, Lin Tian frowned. 
Three hundred thousand troops! 
A coalition of three kingdoms was not just an unwinnable battle at the lower levels, but likely at the higher levels too. 
There must have been many strong opponents. 
Lin Tian’s face was solemn. The nation had just been founded, not even officially established. 
The king’s throne was still warm. 
Suddenly, Lin Tian thought of something. He went to the teleportation array connecting the royal city and the depths of the Great Tomb and teleported directly. 
Due to the great distance between these two places, he had the Holy Mother establish a teleportation array for convenience. 
He was seeking not anyone else, but the Cannibal Eagle. 
“Bird Brother, you know the situation, right? I need your help.” 
In the Cannibal Eagle Tribe, Lin Tian spoke with a deep tone. 
Hearing this, the Cannibal Eagle hesitated for a second before finally nodding, “Don’t worry, our tribe will live and die with you!” 
Facing three hundred thousand human soldiers and the elite forces of three empires was undoubtedly a death sentence. 
Lin Tian was taken aback, “I haven’t finished yet. I don’t need you and your tribe to fight. We can’t win even if we do.” 
“Then what is it?” 
“Under the World Tree lives an ancient dragon. I need you to find a dragon named Nidhogg, a mostly black dragon. Tell her that her father needs help.” Lin Tian continued to explain. 
The Cannibal Eagle looked incredulous, “No way, go to the Ancient Dragon Tribe??! I’ll get killed immediately in that place, and who is Nidhogg?” 
“She’s my descendant.” Lin Tian replied indifferently. 
In an instant, the Cannibal Eagle’s face was filled with disbelief, “No way, you hooked up with an ancient dragon? You’re amazing, Lin Tian!” 
“Haha, Bird Brother, time is of the essence. You better go and return quickly.” Lin Tian laughed and then grew serious. 
They only had four days. 
He didn’t have a flying mount. Even riding Xiao Huan wouldn’t be fast enough; it was too slow. 
So, the Cannibal Eagle was the best choice. 
With Blade of Wings, he was nearly the speed of sound. 
“Okay, but you must hold on. If I can’t return in time, you need to leave Lion King City immediately.” 
The Cannibal Eagle finished speaking and soared into the sky. 
He headed towards the World Tree. 
Back in Lion King City. 
Lin Tian gathered everyone again and advised them not to go out during this period. 
There were likely scouts from other empires outside the city. 
“Boss, what’s going on?” 
In the temple, Gobu Kuang couldn’t help but ask. 
The others were equally puzzled. 
Lin Tian didn’t hide anything and directly explained that a three-hundred-thousand-strong army would soon besiege the city. 
This force was undoubtedly stronger than the Laiyang Plains battle. 
With only a few thousand goblins now, how could they fight against three hundred thousand? 
Hearing this, Gobu Yue was a bit scared, “Aren’t we leaving?” 
“Don’t worry, I have a plan.” 
Lin Tian said as he walked towards the secret chamber where Veronica was imprisoned. 
As long as Little Black could come, they could surely crush this army. Three hundred thousand, even three million, would be nothing. 
The most terrifying thing about dragons was their destructive power. 
One breath of dragon flame could kill tens of thousands. 
What kind of nation would dare use soldiers against a dragon? Maybe the strongest empire. 
Looking across this continent, the Sword Kingdom and others could only be considered medium-sized empires. 
“Boss.” 
Outside the underground secret chamber, Gobu Jian was standing guard and greeted respectfully. 
Lin Tian nodded, “Is she okay?” 
“According to your instructions, we extract her magic power every hour.” Gobu Jian answered. 
“Good.” 
Lin Tian pushed open the door. Veronica was bound by chains in the center of the room, with a goblin wielding a Sealing Sword beside her. 
“Boss, why are you here?” 
Lin Tian waved his hand and got straight to the point, “How are you, Demon Lord?” 
“Hmph, why? Are you being kind enough to visit me? Or are you in trouble?” Veronica sneered. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but admire, “As expected of you, you guessed right. I need your body.” 
To be safe, that was what he said. 
Using Veronica as a mascot to intimidate the Sword Kingdom and others. 
After all, she was a famous demon on the continent, and they surely knew her. 
“My body? What are you going to do, goblin? Don’t be too shameless. My body is just bones now. What can you do…” Veronica said angrily. 
Lin Tian snorted. She was naturally seductive, but now, with no flesh, there was no way to start. 
He threatened, “If you cooperate, you won’t be humiliated. If you refuse, I don’t mind turning into a dog and tasting some bones. 
Speaking of which, even without flesh, the gaps in your bones…” 
“Enough! Just tell me what you want me to do!” Veronica shouted in shame and anger. 
Lin Tian didn’t rush to tell her. He continued to threaten, “If you have any crooked thoughts, I don’t mind killing Rebecca immediately. You know I will.” 
Goblins wouldn’t be merciful. 
Those who should die, none would be spared. 
Those with value, Lin Tian wouldn’t let them eat for free. They had to be fully utilized. 
… 
Three days later. 
In the Torre Mountains, ten kilometers outside Lion King City. 
The mighty coalition army was advancing rapidly. 
The entire mountain range was shrouded in the dust kicked up by the infantry and cavalry! 
Birds and beasts fled in panic. 
The key was the sky was also dark with a large group. 
Soldiers from the Clover Magic Kingdom all used magic. 
They flew on brooms or other strange objects. 
But their speed was about the same as a brisk walk. 
Sword Saint Edward rode a white warhorse at the forefront, his expression solemn and grim. 
Why grim? 
Because above his head, the Gilbert brothers were each riding a pair of beautiful women. 
Such a scene, so indulgent and lewd. 
Edward couldn’t bear to look. 
Flying magic could be cast on any object to make it fly. The larger the object and the heavier the load, the more magic power it consumed. 
“Your Majesty, there are no soldiers or monsters in Lion King City. Just as we thought, we can start the battle directly!” A scout riding a giant mosquito reported. 
In the Sword Kingdom, the giant gold-bellied mosquito was about the size of a person, capable of low-altitude rapid flight. 
It could also climb walls. 
Its flight was very quiet. 
It was often used for reconnaissance.
