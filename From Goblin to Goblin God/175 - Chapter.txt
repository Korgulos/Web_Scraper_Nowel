Chapter 175: A War of Near-Death Experience 
TL: Sungmin 
“It’s impossible! With such power launching an attack, we can’t possibly hold them off—escaping is not even an option!” 
A nobleman clutched his head, his pupils trembling in fear! 
It wasn’t that he was trying to weaken morale at this moment. 
Anyone with a brain, upon hearing the enemy’s strength and seeing those countless dragons in the sky, would think that defeat was inevitable. 
Those who remained calm were only doing so because they had strong mental fortitude. 
But ultimately, this was the reaction of most people. 
No one refuted him. 
The Southern District Captain gritted his teeth and said, “There’s not much time left. The remaining forces in the Eastern District are nearly wiped out. Are we going to fight or not?!” 
“What are we going to fight with? The combined forces of the three districts only amount to 140,000 Titan Warriors, 900,000 elite soldiers, and one million militia! The enemy has dozens of ancient dragons! Even if we gathered all our forces across the nation, it would be useless!” 
“He’s right. We have no experience in dragon slaying, and no individual fighters strong enough. If only the Dragon Slayer Guild were on our side, we’d still have a fighting chance!” 
“Maybe we should surrender! As long as we’re alive, there’s still hope!” 
“You’re naive. These are monsters—goblins, dwarves, dragons! Every single one of them hates humans to the core!” 
“Stop daydreaming! Go to the warehouse and bring out the dragon-slaying weapons. If we don’t fight, are we just going to wait here to die?” 
“We’ve already investigated; the leader of this army is the newly risen Goblin Empire! Damn it, what has this world come to? Goblins allied with so many dragons?!” 
“Goblins and dragons are nothing! The dwarves are the real problem! It’s your fault for constantly capturing them to make magic tools. If you hadn’t, would they have joined the goblin army?!” 
For a moment, the entire meeting room turned into a blame game. 
Everyone started shouting at each other, releasing long-held grudges between the different factions. 
Finally, the Southern District Captain drew his sword and slammed it onto the meeting table. “Enough! We can’t run, and we can’t win! So, do we wait here to be slaughtered, or do we die fighting? You decide!” 
“Anyone who wants to die fighting, come with me!” 
With that, the Southern District Captain left in anger, going out to command the transport of all the dragon-slaying weapons. 
However, many nobles and lords remained behind in the room. 
After all the soldier captains had left, they each returned home to pack their belongings and prepare to flee. 
When the Southern District Captain returned to notify them to prepare for battle, he found the room empty. 
Furious, he cursed, “You useless cowards! You live off the empire’s wealth and enjoy the best treatment! But when trouble comes, you all run away faster than anyone!” 
But right now, there was no time to worry about such things. 
In the Eastern District district, the last Titan Warrior fell, completely devoured by the dragons. 
Lin Tian looked into the distance. Without pausing, he commanded, “Go! Strike directly at their heart! Don’t give them a moment to catch their breath!” 
“Kill!” 
The sound of their war cries shook the earth. 
The army thundered forward, crushing everything in its path! 
At this time, Gobu Tian, who had been sent to scout the enemy’s situation, returned. “Boss, tell the dragons to be careful. They’ve set up a lot of dragon-slaying weapons ahead and gathered the city’s entire military force.” 
“Alright, keep watching. If you can assassinate their leader, do it.” Lin Tian spoke. 
A city on the verge of collapse was only dangerous if it had a leader with unwavering faith to rally the remaining forces. 
As long as that person was killed, the rest could be easily pushed into the abyss. 
Gobu Tian nodded. “Understood. I remember what you said, Boss. And I noticed someone like that among them.” 
“Go on.” 
Then, Lin Tian called over Little Black and the Flame Dragon Mother. “Don’t get too close. Let the dwarves and goblin army enter the battlefield first and destroy the dragon-slaying weapons.” 
“No problem!” 
Next, Lin Tian spoke to Master Bill. “Master, take the war machines and shove them right in their faces!” 
“Hahaha! Will do!” 
Bill, who had somehow gotten his hands on a large bottle of liquor, responded heartily. 
The One-Eyed Owl asked, “What about Alexander? Is he not here?” 
Lin Tian shook his head. “The scouts didn’t see him; he might have escaped.” 
“Is that so? Then we’ll just have to vent our anger on those dukes and nobles! Let’s go!” 
With that, the One-Eyed Owl moved swiftly through the ruins, charging at the forefront! 
The dwarves and goblins continued their assault. 
Within the Southern District district, over a hundred heavy crossbows, each more than twenty meters long, had been set up. 
Additionally, there were ten giant crossbows over fifty meters long. 
These were more than capable of killing dragons like Scar. 
They were even magically enhanced by mages. 
No other empire had crossbows this large, making them helpless against ancient dragons. 
But the War Empire had Titan Warriors to operate them, allowing for quick reloading and firing. 
They were often used in conventional battles, capable of shooting down every enemy within a kilometer straight line with a single bolt! 
Just in time, they could now use these weapons to slay dragons. 
“They’re here! Wait, those in the air are dwarves!” 
A few arrows were launched, but unfortunately, the dwarves’ steel war machines were only a few meters in size. It was like trying to hit a mosquito with a cannon—how could they possibly land a shot? 
“Watch the ground, the goblins are swarming in!” 
The Southern District Captain led from the front, directing the battle as he stood on the front lines. 
He hurriedly issued more orders, “Where are the Titan Warriors? Stop those goblins and dwarves!” 
Zzzz! 
Countless bolts of lightning struck down, bathing the entire Southern District district in a golden ocean of light! 
The Titans, with thunderous steps, charged toward the goblin army. 
Both sides were quickly locked in a fierce struggle. 
There were enough Titans that, for a moment, the goblins were pushed back. 
The Southern District Captain’s face darkened, “Damn it, that giant dwarven machine has to be destroyed first. Who’s going to do it?” 
“I will! Corto, I leave Twilight City to you!” 
The Northern District Captain stepped forward, accompanied by his loyal followers. 
He was fully prepared. 
He had the mages engrave explosive magic on his body. After transforming into a Titan, his body could hold dozens of explosive spells. 
He planned to charge into the mouth of the war machine and detonate it from within. 
Corto, the Southern District Captain, looked resolute, “Javier, you are a true warrior, and I will remember your sacrifice!” 
At the front lines, Bill was drinking, sitting inside the war machine. “Hahaha! A bunch of trash, come on, come on! Be chewed to pieces!” 
The war machine’s massive jaws, like a ravenous snake, opened and closed, devouring and crushing countless Titan Warriors. 
Suddenly, Bill noticed a group of Titan Warriors, each about twenty to thirty meters tall, charging toward him from a distance. 
The magic arrays on their bodies glowed brightly. 
He immediately sensed something was wrong. 
“Oh? These trash are trying to blow themselves up? How naive!” Bill sneered in disdain and continued drinking. 
Javier’s eyes were filled with determination as he shouted, “Charge, soldiers! We are the most glorious!” 
Clang, clang, clang! 
The sound of the steel jaws closing was terrifying! 
But Javier still charged inside! 
In an instant! 
His body was torn in two, blood splattering everywhere! 
Red, nothing but red everywhere! 
It was the symbol of death. 
Those following Javier only saw their vision blur, as everything was covered in a layer of red, obscuring their sight. 
It felt as though their hearts had stopped! 
Everything fell silent. 
For some reason, they felt an eerie sense of clarity. 
“Ah… what’s happening? Is this… death? Captain Javier?” 
The group suddenly saw the recently deceased Javier and felt a deep confusion. 
Then, a dozen Titan Warriors rushed into the war machine. 
… 
Boom! 
In the next moment, a blinding flash exploded! The deafening roar echoed through the air! 
The force of the explosion caused space itself to contract! 
Then it rapidly expanded! 
Unleashing a cataclysmic shockwave! 
Everything within a hundred meters—Titan Warriors, goblins—was engulfed by the flames, their flesh vaporized in an instant. 
They were reduced to skeletons, and even those skeletons turned to black ash! 
Everything within a kilometer radius was violently blown away. 
Bill, staggering above, dropped his bottle. “Damn, was it really that powerful? These lunatics destroyed my machine!” 
The war machine made a cracking sound. 
Its jaw disconnected from the main body. 
It came to a stop. 
From a distance, Southern District Captain Corto watched this scene, his expression deadly serious. “Javier, you have bravely and perfectly completed your mission!” 
The soldiers of the War Empire’s camp began to cheer! 
This was the first step; as long as the machine stopped, they could gain a significant advantage. 
However… 
Bill somehow pulled out another bottle of liquor, took a swig, and pressed a red button. 
The steel that had been consumed earlier began to refine and absorb. 
The war machine’s broken jaw started to fuse back together. 
Clang, clang, clang! 
That seemingly unstoppable war machine roared back to life! 
At that moment. 
Even Corto felt a sliver of despair. “Is this the power of dwarves? The ability to turn anything into a magical tool…” 
“Hahaha! You’re brave—not trash! You’re a bunch of brave trash!” Bill mocked as he continued advancing. 
However, the machine’s speed was now significantly slower. 
Corto quickly ordered, “Forget about him, just move the dragon-slaying weapons away! As long as you don’t get close, you’ll be fine! Focus on holding off the goblins!” 
“Not good! The dragon is coming!” 
In the distant sky. 
An earth elemental dragon was diving toward Corto’s position, intending to trigger an earthquake and send them all plummeting into a crevice. 
Swish! 
Swish, swish, swish! 
But in an instant, a massive bolt was fired from the giant crossbow, striking the enormous body of the dragon, which was over five hundred meters long, with pinpoint accuracy. 
Then came dozens more bolts! 
The ancient dragon was struck all over, blood gushing from its wounds. It let out a pitiful cry as it plummeted toward the ground. 
The Flame Dragon Mother roared in fury, her draconic might shaking the very heavens and earth! “Why didn’t he wait a bit longer!” 
“He was too far away earlier; maybe he didn’t hear the orders. What a shame,” Scar said heavily. 
At this moment, Corto and his men were filled with renewed morale, cheering, “Good, good, good! Did you see that? We just killed an ancient dragon! We’re going to win this!” 
“Kill them!” 
As he spoke, Corto continued to fight fiercely against the dwarves and goblins. 
But then, his heart suddenly tightened, a sense of foreboding washing over him. 
Boom! 
A fifty-meter-tall Titan collapsed right in front of him, crushing a dozen of his comrades to death beneath its massive body. 
Standing atop the corpse was the One-Eyed Owl, swiftly moving toward the dragon-slaying weapons. “Come on, you bastards! Let’s have some fun!” she taunted. 
Hey everyone! Happy New Year!
