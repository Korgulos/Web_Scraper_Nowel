Chapter 190: Confronting One of Joan of Arc’s Key Forces 
TL: Sungmin 
The turmoil quickly subsided. 
The Goblin Empire returned to its former state. 
Night fell. 
The assassins from the three great empires—Sara and the others—gathered together to discuss their next move. 
Zolt, the head puppeteer from the Giant Elephant Empire, was still furious. “Why don’t we act now? I can manipulate dozens of magical puppets to create chaos, and then take the opportunity to kill that damned goblin!” 
Thinking of Persephia’s ordeal, none of them could accept it. 
Luna also had a grave expression. “Indeed, the sooner we eliminate him, the better. The longer we wait, the more things could go wrong.” 
At this moment, Sara rejected the idea. “No, we’ve just settled in, so we’re definitely being closely watched. We need to operate like a regular merchant caravan, conducting our sales, and only act once everything has calmed down.” 
Although she also hated Lin Tian to the bone, for the sake of honor and ensuring Lin Tian’s downfall, she knew they had to be patient. 
“You haven’t been defiled by that goblin! Persephia is still locked in her room!” 
Zolt’s old eyes were bloodshot, his expression seething with rage. His tone was extremely harsh. 
But Sara remained unfazed. “Well, if you think you can do it, go ahead!” 
Zolt was so angry he almost ground his old teeth to dust, unable to stand the arrogance of the people from the Troy Empire. 
He then turned his gaze towards the people of the Holy Tree Empire. “And you, are you going to act? Even the Holy Tree Spirit has been defiled by a goblin! Can you tolerate that???” 
“I…” 
Luna’s expression was conflicted with hesitation, but before she could speak, another warrior from the Holy Tree Empire interrupted her. “We’ll follow Princess Sara’s lead. Calm down, Old Zolt. Acting now would indeed be too risky. Wouldn’t it be better to get closer to that Goblin King first?” 
“Hmph, one seeks honor, the other seeks status. How foolish!” Zolt angrily slammed the table, but he had no choice but to back down. 
After all, Persephia was mentally shattered and unable to fight, and they weren’t arrogant enough to believe they could wipe out a super monster empire. 
At this moment, Sara’s ethereal eyes were filled with killing intent. “Doesn’t he desire my body? Just wait a few days. I’ll make sure he dies in his moment of bliss!!” 
“Princess Sara, that’s a great idea! At that moment, the goblin will definitely be at his most relaxed! A sneak attack will surely succeed!” The Holy Tree warriors nodded in agreement. 
No one had any objections, not even Zolt, who found the plan feasible. 
Sara continued, “Then, when the time comes, you should all be ready. Before I make my move, you will infiltrate the palace and start a massacre, wiping them all out in one go.” 
“No problem!” 
“Princess, your wisdom is unmatched. We’ll follow your lead.” 
“That’s a wise choice. Now, all we need to do is wait. Tomorrow, let’s all focus on our sales tasks. We’ll have to do it sooner or later anyway.” 
The meeting concluded with everyone in agreement. 
The next day. 
The people from the three empires were busy unloading goods, cleaning their shops, and setting up the various items and specialties they had brought with them. 
As word spread quickly, the next day, the Goblin Empire saw a nearly doubled influx of visitors! 
Many came specifically for the specialties of the three empires. 
The Troy Empire, being located in a desert region, offered many desert fruits, plants, special silk garments, delicacies, and so on. 
There was even the unique camel milk. 
All of these were very popular. 
But most people were drawn by the sight of Sara’s stunning beauty. 
The Giant Elephant Empire displayed the puppets they had prepared in advance, with no fear of anyone buying them. 
Each puppet cost hundreds or even thousands of gold coins. 
They were displayed purely for show. 
The Holy Tree Empire, known for its variety of vegetables and plants, offered many delicious root vegetables, which were a favorite among the vegetarian demi-human monsters. 
“Lady Sara, no wonder His Majesty said this mission must succeed. I didn’t expect it to be so profitable!” A Troy hero laughed cheerfully. 
In just half a day, they had already sold goods worth tens of thousands of gold coins. 
If they expanded their scale and attracted more demi-humans and monsters in the future, they couldn’t even imagine how much they would earn in a single day. 
Sara smiled proudly. “Of course. So for the sake of our empire’s development and our honor, we must give it our all when the time comes.” 
On the street. 
Everywhere he went, monsters were bowing and saluting. “Greetings, Your Majesty!” 
Many female demi-human monsters also rushed forward madly. 
The one they were greeting was Lin Tian. 
Behind him were the three district overlords: Gobu Kuang, Gobu Tian, and Gobu Shan. 
“Alright, alright, don’t crowd around.” 
Lin Tian said impatiently. He intended to deal with the people from the three empires and had no time to waste here. 
His words were like a military order, and many of the demi-human monsters wisely stepped aside. 
None of them dared to surround him anymore. 
Otherwise, their lives would be at risk. 
However, there were still some demi-human monsters who persistently tried to curry favor with Lin Tian. 
“Your Majesty, are you thirsty? This is our Wild Bull Tribe’s specialty. Please have a taste!”  
A female member of the Wild Bull Tribe, covered in fur and with a muscular build, enthusiastically offered, holding a steaming bowl of milk. 
Lin Tian immediately felt nauseated. “Goodness, what is this…” 
He noticed a few drops of milky liquid still clinging to the fur on her arm, and her face was even more robust than Gobu Kuang’s. 
Even with sugar, he couldn’t stomach it! 
He waved his hand dismissively. “I’m not hungry right now. Stay away from me.” 
But she wasn’t the only one. 
“Your Majesty, Your Majesty, how about I give you a massage, meow?” 
“Your Majesty, Your Majesty, I can clean every inch of your body with my mouth because I’m from the Snail Tribe!” 
“Would you like to experience an unforgettable, dual sensation of ice and fire, Your Majesty? We Water and Fire Spirits can fulfill your desires!” 
“Move aside! Your Majesty, look at me! You’ll definitely like it! We from the Devil Slug Tribe are soft all over, and we can freely change the size of any part of our body!” 
In no time, Lin Tian was surrounded by female demi-human monsters from various races, making it impossible for him to move! 
Some even abandoned their dignity, flaunting their charms right on the street. 
Gobu Kuang and the others were thoroughly enjoying the spectacle. “Wow, what a feast for the eyes! Following the Boss always leads to good things!” 
“Exactly!” 
But Lin Tian felt nothing for these ordinary demi-human monsters. 
From afar, Sara and the other Troy heroes were stunned. “Impossible! How could a mere goblin monster command such respect?!” 
“Damn it, I’m so jealous! That Devil Slug Tribe girl looks really soft!” One of the Troy heroes grumbled. 
Another spoke up, “No worries. Once we take over this place, we’ll have the same treatment as kings, won’t we?” 
Sara, however, remained silent. “Shameless goblin, and now he’s pretending to be all high and mighty?” 
Previously, he had even gone out of his way to block the path, demanding that each member of the empire submit to him before allowing them to pass. 
On the street. 
Lin Tian, unable to move an inch, shouted, “Enough! Aren’t you afraid of me? I can kill without blinking an eye!” 
“To die at Your Majesty’s hands, I would gladly do so!” 
“Quick, torment me harshly! Don’t show mercy!” 
“If you pierce my heart with your hand, that counts as your body entering mine. I’d die happily!” 
Hearing these outrageous and reckless declarations, Lin Tian nearly burst out laughing. He realized that killing wouldn’t deter them. 
It seemed he had to make them understand that mindlessly offering themselves wouldn’t get them what they wanted. 
He then grabbed the soft Devil Slug Tribe member. “I know what you want. Alright, I’ll satisfy you!” 
He didn’t even bother finding a secluded spot and started right there. 
The sight filled the other demi-human monsters with envy, jealousy, and resentment! 
“I want Your Majesty too! You can’t play favorites like this!” 
“Damn it! How could that despicable Devil Slug Tribe get what they wanted? I refuse to accept this!” 
“I’m next!” 
From afar, the Troy Empire group was even more shocked. “Can this really be happening?” 
“So despicable and shameless, though I suppose it’s not surprising.” 
After a while, a group of demi-human monsters began fantasizing about their future lives—worry-free, able to walk tall in the Goblin Empire! 
And their tribes would also benefit, their status soaring. 
They imagined being respected and adored by all, getting whatever they wanted. 
But Lin Tian pulled up his pants and walked away. “Alright, you greedy bunch, let me be clear—I have no relationship with any of you and won’t be responsible for anyone!” 
“What? Your Majesty, what do you mean? We’re surely already carrying goblin offspring. You won’t take responsibility?” 
The Devil Slug Tribe member, who had just been happily fantasizing, now looked anxious. 
Lin Tian chuckled coldly. “Did I ever say I’d take responsibility? If you’re so eager to add soldiers to the Goblin Empire, go ahead. Raise the offspring yourself, and when they’re grown, take them to Alice’s domain.” 
“How can this be! We had that kind of relationship with you!” 
“Exactly, Your Majesty, you’re being too heartless! Which empire’s king doesn’t take responsibility after being with someone? Even if it’s in secret!” 
They stared at him in disbelief. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but laugh. “Have you all been reading too many fairy tales? I was just playing around. You crossed the line…” 
Then, with a cold expression, he glared at them. 
Gobu Kuang and the others began driving them away, cursing, “Don’t come near! Otherwise, we won’t hesitate to kill you!” 
At that moment, all their dreams of becoming queens or concubines were shattered! 
Knowing Gobu Kuang’s ruthless methods, none of them dared take another step closer. 
They stood there, dumbfounded, having been taken advantage of for nothing! 
When they returned, not only would they lose the respect and adoration of their tribes, but they would also be scorned as worthless! 
For a moment, their pitiful cries echoed through the city, along with the mocking laughter of onlookers. “As expected of His Majesty! Well done! Hahaha!” 
“In the future, you lot should just work at the Succubus House! You can earn a lot of money there!” 
“Hey, little brother, don’t slander us. We at the Succubus House don’t take in ugly ones. Want to come and play? We’ve got only the best!”
