Chapter 178: Joan of Arc: The Villain is Me? 
TL: Sungmin 
The One-Eyed Owl still wore an expression full of disdain. “Is there a problem? An attack like that is barely a scratch; my hands almost broke, that’s all. 
And what’s this about the greatest king, the greatest saintess, and a leader? Just a fool who can’t tell black from white!” 
It wasn’t that the One-Eyed Owl was deliberately mocking her. 
It was simply that she couldn’t stand Joan of Arc supporting Alexander. 
Upon hearing this. 
Joan of Arc did not get angry but argued calmly, “I just can’t bear to see a life fade away before my eyes. I once lived in the rotten, dark slave quarters where people died around me every day… 
Alexander may have mixed personal vendettas with his duties, but now he’s gotten what he deserves. Everything should be handled with compassion, not just violence.” 
Nearby. 
King Cantus quietly advised, “Your Highness Joan, it’s better to let it go. Alexander has already lost his kingdom, saving him has no meaning…” 
“Exactly, and he was the one who provoked others first. It’s only right that he ends up like this.” King Baroque added. 
Even the Mythic-class adventurers did not say a word in defense of Alexander. 
Instead, they all urged Joan of Arc to give up. 
It wasn’t worth making an enemy out of such a massive monster force. 
Especially with dragons and dwarves on their side! 
They even wanted to cozy up to the dwarves, hoping they would forge some magical gear for them. Though they often fought demon kings and earned many spoils, the gear they crafted was quite average. 
If the dwarves crafted it, that would be making the most out of it. 
Commander Emma spoke up, “Your Majesty Joan, let them settle their own grievances. Your empire was just established not long ago; getting into a conflict with these monsters would do more harm than good.” 
Hearing all these words. 
Even Alexander fell into despair, his eyes full of bitterness and helplessness. 
Indeed. 
He understood that he was only temporarily grouped with these people, with no real connections at all. 
To expect them to gamble their kingdom and lives to save him. 
Only a fool would do that. 
However, 
Joan of Arc drew her King’s Sword of Faith! An endless radiance burst forth from the blade! 
The power of faith, so overwhelming it was suffocating! 
This was the King’s Sword forged from the faith of millions! 
“I once swore in the slave pits that I would not give up on anyone, even if it meant betting my life! This is my kingly way!” 
Joan of Arc’s beautiful eyes held a blend of gentleness and strength! 
She raised her sword, ready to make a move to save him. 
The One-Eyed Owl wasn’t afraid at all, her battle spirit reignited after healing her hands! 
Just as tension filled the air, a bolt of lightning shot forth, forcing Joan of Arc to retreat. 
Lin Tian controlled the Spear of Zeus, mocking coldly, “What greatest strategist, war leader? Just an extreme individualist. Are you sure you want to gamble your kingdom, the lives of millions, on this? Isn’t that a bit too foolish?” 
Hearing this. 
Joan of Arc paused, momentarily stunned. 
“Indeed, Your Highness Joan, such a vast monster force, having absorbed the War Empire, has grown even stronger. Fighting them has no meaning, especially just for Alexander?” 
The others chimed in as well. 
Their soldiers were paid for their work; they wouldn’t go to war with a monster empire for world peace without a reason. 
Everything was driven by profit. 
Joan of Arc resolutely responded, “It’s not just for Alexander, but for all suffering humans in this world! I admit there is personal motivation, but… I will see it through to the end!” 
With that said! 
She transformed into a radiant light, forcing the One-Eyed Owl to retreat in an instant. 
Alexander blinked, and he was back among the group. 
But he was already on the verge of death. 
Joan of Arc quickly took out a super recovery potion, pouring it down without hesitation. 
“Damn it, that guy absolutely cannot be allowed to live!” 
The One-Eyed Owl was furious, preparing to charge at them and kill Alexander. 
But Lin Tian blocked her, “Forget it, Boss, that guy is as good as dead.” 
Joan of Arc’s gaze was firm, “As long as I’m here, you vile monsters and fallen humans will never succeed!” 
“Swish!” 
At that moment, the Spear of Zeus, which had been thrown earlier, returned from behind, crackling with thousands of lightning bolts! 
“Ahhhh!” 
It directly burned Alexander, who lay on the ground, to a crisp! 
Joan of Arc had not expected this, “Goblin! You ruthless and brutal monster, you’ve killed so many from the War Empire, can’t you spare even one life? Aren’t you afraid of divine punishment?” 
“Gods? I’ve already offended them. If they dare come punish me, I’ll let them taste the brutality and savagery of a goblin too, hahaha!” Lin Tian laughed coldly. 
Alexander definitely couldn’t be allowed to live; otherwise, he would use his connections to retaliate. 
The consequences would be unthinkable. 
Besides, this also helped the Dragon Slayer Guild get rid of a thorn in their side. 
Joan of Arc was filled with rage, yet she dared not act rashly. Instead, she began to reason, “You creatures born filthy and evil, when will you stop the killing? Can you not hear the wails of millions of souls before you? Why must you be so merciless, even killing Alexander after all he’s suffered… 
Today, I, Davens Joan of Arc, declare here and now that I will drive you evil beings out! Not a single one of you will remain! The blade of justice will sever your head!” 
Lin Tian narrowed his eyes and asked in return, “Justice? I’m sorry, Your Highness Joan, but I actually don’t want to be your enemy. However, aren’t you the one who’s truly guilty, working hand in glove with evildoers?” 
“I don’t want to be your enemy either, Goblin, but how can you accuse Joan of Arc of wrongdoing? She is the greatest saintess.” Behind them, King Cantus couldn’t help but speak up. 
Joan of Arc’s wisdom, courage, fearlessness, and spirit of self-sacrifice were well-known. 
It’s true that once, even Alicenia was responsible for her people, but that was merely due to her duties, not from the heart. 
She feared failing her responsibilities and being punished by the gods. 
But Joan of Arc, though a Child of God, lived among slaves, integrated with them, and led them to liberation. 
She saved every desperate and lost soul. 
Personally involved in the construction of the empire, she took on many roles. 
Though she was a queen, she abolished the monarchy, allowing the people to establish a parliament that would govern the nation, even over her decisions. 
She achieved true freedom and equality. 
And the key point was, she was only 19 years old. At an age when others were focused on love and relationships, she had already accomplished unimaginable feats. 
Her intellectual and moral standards were unprecedented. 
If King Cantus were not a king himself, he would have long since gone to live in her country. 
“Indeed, Goblin, you should not go too far. Her Highness Joan is the light of humanity, the one place where the people’s faith in a person surpasses that in the gods.” Commander Emma also spoke, her expression cold. 
Joan of Arc’s gaze remained resolute, like a torch in the darkness. “There’s no need to say more about these inherently evil monsters. I will drive them all out and rescue the souls from their suffering.” 
“Heh, Your Highness Joan, let me correct you. My Goblin Empire, along with the dwarves and dragons, couldn’t stand the War Empire’s slaughter of innocents and massacre of civilians. That’s why we took justice into our own hands and overthrew them.” Lin Tian laughed coldly, his tone full of mockery. 
Upon hearing this. 
Joan of Arc snorted, “So you mean to say that you monsters are doing something righteous?” 
The One-Eyed Owl sneered, “Of course! In my Dragon Slaughter City, though we have few people, we had seven thousand households, with over thirty thousand people. Alexander protected a criminal who slaughtered entire families, even sending troops to kill all but a few hundred of my thirty thousand citizens…” 
For a moment. 
Joan of Arc’s face slightly changed, her eyes evasive. 
“Kekeke, Your Highness Joan, I’m just a righteous goblin, after all. Now, what were you saying? That you were going to drive us out and cut off my head? It seems like you’re standing on the wrong side of justice!” Lin Tian said in a mocking tone, his voice dripping with sarcasm. 
This made Joan of Arc’s face flush with embarrassment. She opened her rosy lips but didn’t know what to say. 
Even King Cantus and the others remained silent, preferring to say as little as possible. 
They didn’t want to stir up trouble. 
This goblin was definitely not someone to be trifled with, not even Joan of Arc could stand up to him! 
Finally, Joan of Arc angrily retorted, “You… you’re cunning! Twisting words to suit your needs! Don’t think that by claiming justice, you can disguise your bloodthirsty nature. The root of all this evil is clearly Alexander. If you had just killed him, wouldn’t that have been enough!? Why did you have to kill so many others?” 
Lin Tian raised an eyebrow, smirking as he replied, “The War Empire was known for waging war and annexing weaker nations, hence its name. For the sake of world peace, I had to overthrow it. What’s wrong with that?” 
“You!” 
Joan of Arc found herself speechless for a moment. Was she the villain all along? 
The One-Eyed Owl beside her couldn’t hold back any longer. “Haha! Don’t say another word, kid. Her Majesty Joan is just 19, a good kid! Keep it up, and she might start crying.” 
“Oh, look at that little face; she’s already on the verge of tears!” 
“Don’t cry, don’t cry. Come here, let uncle give you a hug!” 
Osius and Grugia immediately began fanning the flames. 
Joan of Arc almost lost her composure, “I… you all…” 
Her faith wavered for a moment. 
Fortunately, she quickly recovered, “You monsters and fallen ones, stop speaking! Goblin, even if you twist words now, what about before? Don’t think I don’t know—you seized the Lionheart Empire, slaughtered the Sword Kingdom and the Magic Kingdom. All these sins are the reasons I will punish you!” 
“No, no, no~ 
Your Highness Joan, you’ve got it all wrong. It was the Great Tomb that defeated the Lionheart Empire. I was merely upholding justice by eliminating the Great Tomb, the monster that has plagued us for millennia. And you should take a look— the people of the Lionheart Empire are well-fed, warmly clothed, and living happily with their families! 
The Sword Kingdom and Magic Kingdom coveted the land my people and I created hand-in-hand. It was in self-defense that they were destroyed. Is there a problem with that? 
And now you keep pressing on, wanting to punish me. Are you saying that what I’ve done is evil? 
Is this how you define evil?! 
Oh my, I can’t imagine what kind of twisted and dark nation your people live in! I truly feel sorry for them…” 
Lin Tian’s string of accusations left Joan of Arc mentally exhausted, panicked, and bewildered. 
It seemed as if she had become the villain, about to attack a righteous protagonist. 
She truly felt a pang of guilt and regret in her heart. 
King Cantus, Commander Emma, and the others were rendered speechless by Lin Tian’s words.  
“This guy… this guy! This guy is just… too much! Too!” 
They struggled for a long time. 
But in the end, they couldn’t muster a single word in rebuttal. 
The feeling of injustice was like that of a child who hadn’t done anything wrong but was falsely accused and punished, while the real culprit received praise and rewards, all while mocking them. 
Anyone less resilient would have broken down in tears from the sheer frustration. 
… 
Lmao, what the heck is Lin Tian spouting. Crazy gaslighting.
