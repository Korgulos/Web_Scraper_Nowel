Chapter 203: Heading to the Holy Tree Empire, A Shocking Battle! 
TL: Sungmin  
Explosions echoed as the meteor was reduced to ashes beneath the Holy Sword. 
Joan of Arc, now completely exhausted, was drenched in sweat, panting heavily on one knee. 
“Your Majesty, are you alright?” General Brian rushed forward to inquire. 
Joan of Arc shook her head with difficulty. “I’m fine. What about everyone else? Has anyone been hurt by the meteor fragments?” 
“They’re all fine, fortunately. Everyone gathered together, so the fragments only destroyed the city’s buildings.” Brian quickly replied. 
Hearing this, Joan of Arc finally felt relieved, though her beautiful eyes were filled with rage. “You damned goblins! This won’t be the end of us!” 
“Take everyone back first. Once my divine power recovers, we’ll launch a crusade! We must destroy that monster empire and bring peace back to the world!” 
… 
“Boss, how is it?!” 
At the goblin king’s square, everyone gathered upon hearing the news, bombarding Lin Tian with questions. 
Lin Tian’s eyes glinted with cold fury. “Twilight City is gone. Next, we’ll kill that bitch Joan of Arc!” 
“What…!” 
Gobu Kuang and the others were equally furious. 
Twilight City had consumed a vast amount of time and money. 
Moreover, it could continuously supply soldiers. 
Now, everything was gone. 
Alice quickly asked, “Messenger, should I gather the army immediately?” 
“No, no need. Simply taking the Free Empire would be too easy for that bitch Joan of Arc. I want her to die in despair! Without shedding a single drop of blood, I’ll make her understand… a demigod isn’t a reason for arrogance. Before us, even gods must kneel in lowly submission!” 
Lin Tian narrowed his eyes, and his murderous intent seemed to spill out. 
This was the greatest setback he had faced since his transmigration! 
He could not tolerate such humiliation. A simple assault wouldn’t be enough to vent his anger. 
In the distance, the dwarves, led by Bill, were busy rebuilding the palace. 
Lin Tian said, “Alright, you all go help them. Sara, come with me on a trip.” 
“Boss, where are you off to again?” 
Gobu Yue couldn’t help but ask. 
During this period, her strength had increased significantly. 
She had reached nine thousand points, so she wanted to go along and help. 
Lin Tian thought for a moment. “We’re going to check out the Giant Elephant Empire and the Holy Tree Empire. Only Sara is familiar with those places.” 
They had previously framed both empires. 
He didn’t know if a war had broken out yet. If it had, they could send troops to pick up the pieces and take over both empires. 
That would sever the Free Empire’s connection to the outside world. 
Then, the next steps could be taken. 
Next, he would send the insect race’s locust army to ravage the Free Empire, devouring all their crops and food. 
When people are starving, they’ll do anything. 
At that time, faith and gods would mean nothing. As long as someone could give them a mouthful of food, they’d be willing to do anything. 
… 
Beyond the War Empire, the main empires were Troy, Giant Elephant, and Holy Tree. 
The Free Empire was slightly behind the Giant Elephant and Holy Tree empires. 
Further beyond that, spanning thousands of kilometers, lay an Uninhabited Zone, home to countless monsters—a region even more extensive and enchanted than the Great Tomb. 
Other empires were much farther away. After all, no one wanted to be near the Uninhabited Zone where monsters roamed unchecked. 
AN: (I’ll provide a world map someday, it’s a bit complex to explain.) 
TL: Basically, the current storyline is within a corner of a continent. The corner is separated by the uninhabited zone, separating the current setting (known as the wilderness) and the rest of the continent. 
Outside the Giant Elephant Empire. 
The army had long since gathered—a million elite soldiers and another million militiamen. 
While they didn’t have a vast number of soldiers, their ten thousand magical puppets could rival millions of cavalry! 
The largest puppet stood over a thousand meters tall! 
The sight was truly awe-inspiring! 
With every movement, the earth trembled. 
These puppets were mostly modeled after magical creatures. From a biological standpoint, humans were not suited for combat. 
The human brain was its true weapon. 
On the other hand, the claws and teeth of monsters were inherently designed for attack. 
And some unique magical creatures possessed even more powerful and varied methods of assault. 
The Giant Elephant King stood atop a thousand-meter-tall, three-headed dragon puppet. “The Holy Tree Empire has oppressed us repeatedly. Today is the day of our revenge! Let all the anger from these years be unleashed! We shall completely annihilate them!” 
“Annihilate them completely!!!” 
The soldiers shouted in unison, their voices deafening! 
For decades, the two neighboring empires had constantly been at odds. 
The Holy Tree Empire, relying on the protection of its Holy Tree, often acted recklessly and provoked the Giant Elephant Empire. 
After receiving word from Zolt, the Giant Elephant King and the entire nation were incensed. 
Unable to tolerate it any longer, they mobilized the full power of their country. 
Such an overwhelming force. 
It was breathtaking! 
However, far away in the Holy Tree Empire, preparations had long been made for a counterattack. 
All the soldiers across the nation had been called to the capital, ready to face the invaders at any moment. 
“Hmph, Giant Elephant King, I’d like to see what you have to fight us with! The Holy Tree has bloomed and borne fruit for the first time in a thousand years! It contains an even greater power! Even if you come with the full strength of your nation, none of you will return!” 
The Holy Tree King stood on the city walls, gazing at the distant horizon. 
Behind him towered the massive Holy Tree, reaching into the clouds. 
The petals had already withered, and clusters of black fruits hung densely, creating a shocking sight! 
In fact, it looked somewhat eerie, more like a demonic tree than a holy one. 
However, the people of the Holy Tree Empire viewed this phenomenon as a divine miracle. 
Within the city, two million elite soldiers were ready. 
Combined with the power of the Holy Tree, they were fully confident in their victory. 
Time passed quickly. 
Five days went by in a flash. 
On this day, the Holy Tree King still stood vigil on the city walls, staring at the horizon. 
Suddenly. 
A fallen leaf on the wall began to tremble. 
It was clearly on the ground, and there wasn’t the slightest breeze. 
This puzzled him. 
Suddenly, realization struck him. “They’re here! All soldiers, prepare for battle!” 
Sure enough. 
Soon, scouts arrived from beyond the horizon. “Your Majesty, the Giant Elephant Empire’s army has arrived!” 
As the rumbling grew louder, Lin Tian, standing on a clock tower behind the walls, also grew serious. “So, it’s finally starting. I wonder what the final outcome will be.” 
He had disguised himself as Andy, and since Sara rarely appeared in public, there was no concern about her being recognized by common people. 
“By the way, is this the Holy Tree? It doesn’t look much like the World Tree,” Lin Tian remarked, clearly surprised. 
Sara also found it strange. “I saw it once before, and it didn’t look like this. Now, the Holy Tree seems to have an aura of a monster…” 
“Is that so? Well, it doesn’t matter to us.” Lin Tian shrugged. 
On the distant horizon, shadows began to appear in rows! 
Some had vicious claws, others twisted, grotesque shapes. 
Using his sharp skills, Lin Tian could clearly make out the scene at a glance. “So, this is puppet magic? They’ve made so many monster puppets… a three-headed dragon, hellhounds, thunder bears, disaster lizards, iron rhinos…” 
Each magical creature was over a hundred meters tall, an absolutely breathtaking sight! 
Approaching with the rising sun, their presence was overwhelming! 
However, as long as the Holy Tree stood, the people of the Holy Tree Empire feared nothing. 
They had endured countless attacks. 
Not once had they been defeated. 
But, 
As the army of the Giant Elephant Empire approached the city walls, even the Holy Tree King couldn’t help but feel the pressure. 
There were far too many large-scale magical puppets, and the sight was incredibly intimidating. 
The Giant Elephant King stood atop the thousand-meter-tall three-headed dragon, shouting, “Holy Tree King, you despicable, shameless bastard! We all put in our efforts, but you, so greedy, even went as far as to frame our people! Why didn’t you dare leak the information about the Troy Empire?” 
The animosity between the two sides had festered for so long that they didn’t even want to call each other by name anymore, thinking it was bad luck. 
“Hmph, Giant Elephant King, is that your excuse? It’s unnecessary! We’ve never been afraid of war!” The Holy Tree King replied disdainfully. 
Hearing this, the face of the Giant Elephant King twitched in rage. He hadn’t expected the other side to be so blatant, not even trying to deny it. 
Immediately, he commanded the thousand-meter-tall, pitch-black, lifelike three-headed dragon to attack. 
“Roar!” 
A deafening dragon roar echoed through the air! 
One of the three heads spewed a massive torrent of water, drenching the Holy Tree soldiers as if rain were pouring down on them. 
Next. 
The second head unleashed a blast of cold air! 
The white mist instantly froze the water on contact, turning everything into ice! 
The bone-chilling cold made the Holy Tree soldiers shiver uncontrollably! 
“World-Class Magic · Holy Tree Healing!” 
The Holy Tree King stood on the wall and calmly spoke. 
Massive tree roots emerged from the ground, glowing with a soft green light, healing the wounded and restoring body heat. 
Seeing this, the third head of the three-headed dragon spewed a sky full of flames! 
“World-Class Magic · Sea of Leaves!” 
It was the same magic that Luna had used before, but its effect was much stronger near the Holy Tree. 
Countless leaves flew through the air, colliding with the flames and igniting. 
The clash nullified the attack, creating a dazzling explosion of fire in the sky. 
Seeing this, the Giant Elephant King grew impatient. “Advance! Flatten this place! Leave no one alive! Uproot that so-called Holy Tree!!” 
“Roar!” 
Thousands of magical puppets charged forward!!! 
Giant wolves, giant elephants, giant bears, and many more! 
Every step they took shook the ground, nearly causing the Holy Tree soldiers to go deaf from the sound. 
The pressure they exerted was so immense that the soldiers almost couldn’t muster the will to resist! 
Their bodies trembled, and they wanted to turn and flee! 
“So, this is the Giant Elephant Empire. They’re indeed something. With so many magical puppets, I truly have no way to defend against them.” 
Lin Tian’s expression grew complicated. He had thought himself strong, but clearly, there was still a long way to go. 
Besides, they were merely small fry on the continent. 
In the world beyond the wilderness, that’s where the real hell awaited! 
It seemed that after devouring all the empires within the wilderness, he would need to consolidate their full strength. 
Only when he had reached a new level of power would he dare to explore the world beyond the wilderness. 
The Holy Tree King let out a disdainful snort. “Tree, do it!!” 
“Boom! Boom! Boom!” 
From beneath the ground, terrifying tremors erupted! 
Countless colossal tree roots, hundreds of meters thick and thousands of meters long, burst forth from the earth! 
“Boom!” 
With a single casual swipe, a three-hundred-meter-tall giant wolf puppet was crushed into dust, reduced to nothing but fragments of the ore it had been crafted from.
