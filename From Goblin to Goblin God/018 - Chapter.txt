Chapter 18: The New Pet 
TL: Sungmin 
In the tribe. 
Seeing so many big goblins appear, Loder and the others thought it was an invasion by other goblins! 
They couldn’t imagine the agony of being tortured for so long and then immediately facing such a painful ordeal again! 
“Gobu Tian, you’re back? You’ve all become so powerful!” 
At this moment, Gobu Yue greeted them. 
Loder then understood that the previous group of small goblins had all evolved into big ones! 
What a terrifying situation! 
This was a goblin tribe with dozens, nearly a hundred big goblins! 
Even in the largest enchanted forest of the Lionheart Empire, it was already a formidable presence. 
And this was just a small piece of the remote enchanted forest! 
“That leading goblin, what kind of monster did it evolve to? We must have the Imperial Knights and my master eradicate this terrifying tribe as soon as possible!” 
The more Loder thought about it, the more terrified he became, trembling uncontrollably. 
If left unchecked, it would surely cause a massive uproar. 
… 
Lin Tian also returned to the tribe, planning to give it a name. 
This would make it easier to declare war on the Bloodfang Tribe. 
However, he was not inclined to declare war; a surprise attack would be better, but the tribe still needed a name. 
He gathered all the goblins and asked, “Gobu Yue, Lia, Gobu Tian, and you all, what do you think would be a good name for our tribe?” 
The current members had become more intelligent, allowing for higher-level communication. 
Gobu Yue thought for a moment, “How about we call it the Mighty Tribe? Let’s grow strong together! Hehe!” 
“Little Yue, you’re too naive. Goblin tribes are usually named after their leader,” Lia teased. 
Gobu Tian and Gobu Kuang looked at each other, pondering what the name should be. 
Finally, they said, “Boss, let’s call it the Dragon Slayer Tribe? We will slay dragons in the future!” 
Seeing their foolish yet pretentious looks, Lin Tian’s eyes lit up. 
“Well, let’s call it the Tian Kuang Tribe.” 
With that, the decision was made. 
“Tian Kuang Tribe! Tian Kuang Tribe! Tian Kuang Tribe!” 
The goblins cheered, dancing and jumping around. 
It seemed that even after evolving, they couldn’t shake off their silly habits. 
Lin Tian chose this name to make others believe that the tribe leaders were Gobu Tian and Gobu Kuang. 
This way, he could stay safe. 
He also planned to primarily train these two, making them the main combat force. 
The next day during the day. 
Lin Tian set out alone to scout the Bloodfang Tribe and gather information. 
He traversed the enchanted forest to the far east, unexpectedly discovering that the previously marked goblin tribe had vanished! 
“Huh? Weren’t there the Black Bear Tribe and the War Horse Tribe? How were they wiped out?” 
Previously, he saw that these two tribes had big goblins, and their combined strength was equal to the Bloodfang Tribe. 
But in such a short time, how could they have disappeared as if they evaporated? 
However, they were not Lin Tian’s target; he continued towards the Bloodfang Tribe. 
Finally, he arrived outside the Bloodfang Tribe. 
This tribe had an excellent environment, built by a fish-rich river and surrounded by plains. 
Because it was easy to obtain food in the early stages, the tribe developed well. 
There were many huts, with at least three hundred goblins, possibly more. 
Although it was daytime, there were always goblins on the watchtower scouting, and even patrol squads circling the camp. 
Lin Tian was amazed, saying, “So cautious? Could it be…” 
He was still thinking when suddenly a completely different goblin emerged from a large hut! 
It was entirely black-brown, with strange blood-painted markings on its skin, nearly two meters tall! 
Its tusks protruded, and its eyes were fierce and glaring! 
It held a bone hammer the size of a small car, seemingly made from the skull and spine of some creature. 
A hero variant! 
A giant hammer goblin! 
That bone hammer was even larger than its own body. 
Lin Tian suddenly understood, “So it evolved into a giant hammer goblin and wiped out all the surrounding goblin tribes. How did this guy evolve so quickly?” 
This was the most puzzling part. 
However, after a closer look, he understood. 
The shape of that bone hammer resembled a fourth-tier magical beast from the western forest! The Ghostly Zebra! 
“It actually hunted a fourth-tier magical beast? No wonder.” 
The Ghostly Zebra was the strongest magical creature in this enchanted forest. 
Its body was at least seven or eight meters long, and its head and neck were perfect for making a large hammer. 
Lin Tian then checked that guy’s attribute panel. 
[Warhammer Goblin (Bloodfang): Lv50<br/>
Race: Goblin<br/>
Profession: High-tier Warrior<br/>
Titles: Monster Slayer, Goblin Hero, God’s Blessing, Breeding Machine, …<br/>
Health: 700<br/>
Strength: 239<br/>
Defense: 114<br/>
Skills: Fierce Hammer Strike, Great Strength, Stone Skin, Climb, Silent Steps…<br/>
Equipment: Bone Hammer<br/>
Overall: 900] 
Due to the lack of ironworking technology, its attributes weren’t overly monstrous. 
The goblins of Lin Tian’s Tian Kuang Tribe all wore iron armor and wielded iron swords. Even though their base attributes weren’t ideal, the difference between having equipment and not having it was significant. 
However, since they all lived in the same enchanted forest, the Warhammer Goblin’s skills were mostly the same. 
“It doesn’t seem too powerful; with an overall combat strength of 900, a dozen goblin warriors should be able to handle it,” Lin Tian said. However, capturing it alive would be much more difficult. 
This guy had likely eaten the immune porcupine in the enchanted forest, giving it strong resistance to paralysis toxins. 
If only the white-robed nun Ifreya could be used by him, he could directly employ imprisonment-type holy magic. 
“I’ll think of a plan after returning,” he decided. 
Having gathered enough information, Lin Tian left the western side of the forest. 
The goal of dealing with the Bloodfang Tribe was straightforward: to capture the giant hammer goblin and make it a breeding stud to produce a better next generation. 
This was essential to having the strength to counter the human empire. 
Otherwise, they would eventually be exterminated. 
Upon returning to the tribe, the foolish Gobu Kuang approached, “Boss, according to your instructions, that human is no longer able.” 
Lin Tian turned his head. 
He saw Ifreya lying on the ground, unconscious. 
As for Loder, his main ordeal hadn’t even begun. 
But watching his goddess being tormented by goblins all day had driven him mad. 
Lin Tian slowly walked over and slapped Ifreya awake, “Hehehe, are you in pain now? Suffering?” 
“Kill me. I want to atone before God,” Ifreya said, waking up in a state of collapse. 
However, Lin Tian changed his approach. He brought warm water and began to clean Ifreya’s wounds and filth. 
“The boss is such a neat freak, haha!” Gobu Kuang laughed foolishly on the side. 
Ifreya thought Lin Tian was being kind, but she quickly realized the truth and resisted frantically, “No, I was wrong! I’m going insane! It hurts so much!” 
Hearing this, Loder screamed in agony, “You beast! That’s enough! Aren’t you done yet, you evil, shameless goblin?” 
But Lin Tian looked genuinely heartbroken as he held Ifreya in his arms, comforting her like an elder, “It’s okay, it’s okay. I won’t let them hurt you anymore.” 
Ifreya was stunned and then broke down, crying in Lin Tian’s arms, venting her accumulated grievances and pain. 
In her eyes, everything had lost its color. She had prayed countless times for God to save her, but God never came. 
Only now did Lin Tian extend a helping hand. 
Lin Tian carried her to a large water tank and carefully washed her body. 
“From now on, as long as I’m here, no other goblins will control you. I am your God, understand?” he said, continuing his psychological manipulation while washing her. 
In her current state, Ifreya’s mind was blank, making it the best time for psychological manipulation. 
“Yes, I am a servant of God. I will stay by your side as long as you protect me,” Ifreya said excitedly, like a kitten. 
Then he continued to strengthen his psychological manipulation and brainwashing. 
Soon, Ifreya became a devoted follower of Lin Tian, believing that as long as she stayed by his side, she would be safe. 
Nothing else mattered. 
“My God, Ifreya is willing to give everything,” she said, rubbing against Lin Tian’s leg obediently. 
Seeing this, Lia and the others felt incredibly fortunate. 
They couldn’t imagine becoming like that; it was worse than death! 
As for Loder, his true hell had begun. 
Gobu Kuang and the others approached him with evil smiles, “Humans are great; even males have such delicate skin. You live longer than me, yet your skin is better!” 
“What are you doing? Hey! Wait! Is this a mistake? Are you serious?!” 
“Ahhhh!” 
That day, a new beast was born in the enchanted forest. 
Looking at Ifreya, Lin Tian asked, “I want to see you use the Holy Light Cage skill.” 
Now, she dared not disobey Lin Tian, fearing he would abandon her. 
“Holy Light? Cage? What is that? My Lord, I don’t know,” Ifreya said, confused, having forgotten all human affairs. 
Lin Tian brought her the original magic book. 
After flipping through a few pages, she finally responded, “Holy Light Cage? Is this it?” 
As she spoke, her magic activated involuntarily, connecting with the magic book.
