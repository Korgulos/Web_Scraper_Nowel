Chapter 177: The Demigod’s Wrath. Big Sis, Be Good, Stop Messing Around! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Damn goblins! Monsters! Dragons, dwarves! Dragon Slayer Guild! You despicable bastards, attacking my country while I was away, slaughtering my people—you all deserve to die!!!” 
Upon seeing Lin Tian and the others approach, Alexander’s old face twisted with fury. He was driving his war chariot, itching to run Lin Tian and his group over. 
A captivating woman holding a staff stopped him, “Your Majesty Alexander, please calm down. For these monsters to destroy your country so quickly, they must be incredibly powerful.” 
“Captain Emma! How do you expect me to calm down?! Ahhh!” 
Alexander was grinding his teeth so hard they nearly shattered. He struggled to regain his composure. 
However, the One-Eyed Owl spoke up, “Despicable? Your Majesty Alexander, isn’t it despicable that you used public office to settle private scores? A king like you, who knowingly shielded Patrick despite his vile treachery, causing the destruction of the Grugia family—who’s the real despicable one here? And after a legitimate act of vengeance, you sent troops to attack us. Who’s the despicable one now?” 
At that moment, Alexander lost all restraint. “Very well, Elizabeth Tilly! So it was you who conspired with these monsters—I’ll kill you!!!” 
“Rumble, rumble!” 
The war chariot roared with the thunder of iron, mirroring his inner turmoil! Immediately, he charged forward! 
The One-Eyed Owl grinned, pushed off with her legs, and seemed to fly toward the chariot! 
“Your Majesty Alexander, don’t be rash!” Joan of Arc called out with concern, but it was already too late. 
Lin Tian also wanted to call back the One-Eyed Owl, knowing that there were too many top-tier opponents on the other side. But on second thought, who could possibly stop a lioness gone mad, breaking free from her cage? 
You’d have to be insane to try. 
“Boom!” 
In the sky, a deafening explosion rang out, and flames erupted everywhere! The pieces of the war chariot flew in all directions, and Alexander was flung out from the flames! 
He crashed into the city wall, knocking down a section of it, leaving bricks scattered all over the ground. 
The One-Eyed Owl clenched her fists and charged at him with a crazed expression! 
Alexander was so terrified he didn’t even dare to breathe. He quickly got up to defend himself, and their fists collided. 
The shockwave from their clash shattered all the surrounding bricks! 
The visual impact was utterly breathtaking! 
By now, Lin Tian could clearly see the strength of all the opponents. 
He hadn’t expected each one to be more formidable than the last. 
Most of them had over ten thousand combat power. 
Some even had over fifteen thousand. 
But the most terrifying, the one with overwhelming power, was Joan of Arc.

With such terrifying strength, if she were to harbor any murderous intent, none of them would stand a chance. 
Behind her, there were several people wearing crowns, clearly kings of their own realms. 
And there was also a group whose chest emblems were strikingly prominent! 
Mythic-class Adventurers!!! 
These were among the very top-tier adventurer groups of this continent, definitely from the Star Sanctuary! 
The Star Sanctuary was equivalent to the continent’s Adventurer’s Guild headquarters. Any team formally joining it had to be Mythic-class. 
Their daily activities involved either slaying Demon Kings or contributing to world peace. 
Or perhaps being hired by a powerful nation to participate in national wars. 
They also explored mysterious, uncharted continents and territories. 
In short, they were extremely powerful. 
“Bang!” 
At that moment, the One-Eyed Owl and Alexander were still fiercely battling. 
Both were descendants of demigods, with some divine blood flowing in their veins. 
Their combat power was both around 13,000. 
But, Alexander was clearly struggling, “Madwoman! Enough! Stop it!” 
By now, his fists were drenched in blood. 
The One-Eyed Owl, driven by a frenzy, continued her relentless assault, her punches coming too fast for him to counter. 
He didn’t even have a chance to draw his weapon. 
“This is just the beginning, Your Majesty Alexander!! Unless I die or you die, this will never stop!” 
The One-Eyed Owl shouted maniacally, her eyes nearly rolling back as she was completely overtaken by the desire to fight, losing all sense of reason! 
Her mind was fixated solely on killing him or being killed by him. 
Alexander, despite his cleverness, was now utterly lost on what to do! 
Although someone as simple-minded as this would normally be easy to deal with, the One-Eyed Owl had managed to turn the situation into a mindless brawl, leaving even Alexander with a blank mind. 
Joan of Arc couldn’t stand it anymore and called out, “Your Majesty Alexander, stop just defending yourself—use your weapon!” 
“Yes, yes! I need to dodge first, then find an opening to draw my weapon. Once I do, you madwoman, you’re done for!” 
Alexander struggled to keep himself alert, his eyes fixed on the One-Eyed Owl’s attack trajectory. 
Finally, he found an opportunity! 
He quickly stepped back half a pace and reached for the large sword strapped to his back. 
“Not good!” 
But because he freed up one hand, he underestimated the One-Eyed Owl’s ability to fight more fiercely as the battle went on, her speed increasing even more! 
Even though he managed to dodge one punch, he didn’t expect her fists to come faster and in greater numbers! 
“Bang!” 
When her fist connected with Alexander’s shoulder, it was as if a missile had exploded! 
He was sent flying once again, crashing through another section of the city wall! 
His shoulder bones shattered in an instant, and the shockwave of the impact reverberated through his body, rattling his brain, almost knocking him unconscious! 
But it wasn’t over! 
The One-Eyed Owl, like an unstoppable machine, charged into the rubble of the city wall, her fists whistling through the air! 
It was clear that Alexander took several more hits. 
“Ahhhh!” 
In an instant, several massive blades of light burst out from the rubble, forcing the One-Eyed Owl to retreat. 
Alexander emerged, but one of his arms had been completely shattered, along with his shoulder! Blood was pouring out! 
Holding the Blade of War in his one remaining arm, the look in his eyes had completely shifted from battle readiness to sheer terror! 
He was terrified, wildly attacking in a panic. 
His eyes darted around, fearing the One-Eyed Owl might strike again. 
Finally, he locked onto her. 
“World-Class Combat Skill: Titan Deity’s Execution!!” 
“Ahhh!” 
Alexander roared, his entire body surging with power! Several magic circles formed and condensed around him. 
From within the magic circles, a towering, hundred-meter-tall pale purple specter appeared, wielding a massive blade. 
It was terrifying. 
The ancient, mysterious power radiating from it overwhelmed everyone’s minds. 
Then, the Titan Deity aimed at the One-Eyed Owl and struck down heavily! 
The One-Eyed Owl wasn’t foolish; she quickly dodged. 
As the deity’s giant blade descended, it carved a hundred-meter-long fissure into the earth! It was a shocking sight! 
And this wasn’t just a single strike. 
The deity could slash continuously, in a relentless fury! 
The One-Eyed Owl moved toward Joan of Arc and her group. By this point, Alexander was so triggered that he didn’t care who he might injure; he only wanted to kill the One-Eyed Owl. 
Seeing this, Joan of Arc lightly tapped the ground with the Sword of Faith, generating a pure, radiant protective shield that enveloped everyone. 
The deity’s strikes landed, but had no effect on them. 
However, the city wall beneath their feet couldn’t withstand the tremendous power and collapsed with a thunderous crash. 
It wasn’t long before Alexander, already exhausted from his earlier battle with the Demon King, could no longer sustain the deity’s presence, and the specter dissipated. 
The One-Eyed Owl grinned, “Done already? If you’re done, then it’s my turn again!” 
In an instant! 
A shadow flashed toward Alexander. 
The sound of flesh tearing was sickening! 
Alexander was sent flying again, his head battered and bleeding from the One-Eyed Owl’s punches, making him almost unrecognizable. 
It was a pitiful sight. 
The One-Eyed Owl immediately followed. 
From Alexander’s barely visible mouth, blood and froth bubbled out—perhaps he was trying to speak. 
He had lost all ability to fight back and lay motionless on the ground. 
The One-Eyed Owl stepped on his chest, her eyes full of disdain, “Hmph, this is what you deserve!!” 
At this scene, everyone was utterly shocked. 
Though they both had the same bloodline and similar strength, the One-Eyed Owl had almost completely crushed him. Her overwhelming momentum was clearly crucial, driving Alexander into a state where he couldn’t even retaliate or think straight. 
“Help… help me, Your Majesty Joan of Arc, Your Majesty Cantus! Lord Baroque! Captain Emma!” 
Finally, Alexander spat out the blood and shattered teeth from his mouth, calling out desperately. 
The group among the ruins of the city wall looked on with complex expressions. 
The kings of several empires glanced at the dragons soaring and roaring across the sky—who would dare provoke such a force? 
Moreover, there was an endless army of goblins, dwarves, and monsters! 
Even the Mythic-class adventurers didn’t want to get involved in this mess. They were likely waiting to see what the Star Sanctuary would decide before taking action. 
They all chose silence. 
It was nothing more than a temporary alliance, each having claimed their spoils for killing the Demon King. 
Now, they had nothing to do with each other. 
It wasn’t worth it to provoke such a terrifying monster faction for Alexander’s sake. 
Besides, they had only come because of Alexander’s persistent invitations; otherwise, they would have returned to their own lands long ago. 
But just as everyone remained silent and Alexander was in utter despair, Joan of Arc’s voice, like a beacon in the darkness, a hope amidst hopelessness, rang out! Though it was a gentle, melodic female voice, it carried immense power. 
“Lady Elizabeth, since you’ve had your revenge, could you spare his life?” 
Hearing this, Alexander was so moved he nearly wept. 
The kings standing behind Joan of Arc could only silently give her a thumbs-up; none of them could compare to her. 
“Spare him? Hmph, after so many people from the Dragon Slayer Guild have died, how can I just let that go? Who’s going to let it go?” Lin Tian said at that moment. 
Hearing this, Joan of Arc pointed to the ruins before them, her eyes filled with anger. “Goblins! Monsters! Look at the remains within these ruins! The souls of the dead are crying out in agony! 
Who will take responsibility for them? You vicious, detestable creature, I swear I will personally erase you from this world!” 
As she spoke, magical circles began to form around her sword. 
She aimed at the One-Eyed Owl, and like a laser cannon, fired a burst of pure, radiant energy imbued with the power of faith! 
The One-Eyed Owl didn’t dodge but took the blast head-on, yet she was still sent flying, with her forearm, used to block the beam, left mangled and bloody. 
She sneered, “Hahaha, the power of a demigod is nothing special after all!” 
“Oh dear, Big Sis, stop messing around. She wasn’t even using her full strength. Come on, let’s step back for now, okay?” 
The members of the Dragon Slayer Guild were all deeply worried. 
If the One-Eyed Owl and Joan of Arc started fighting, the consequences would be catastrophic. 
For the One-Eyed Owl, it was a fight to the death—Joan of Arc might not want to kill her, but she would have no choice but to do so to stop the battle.
