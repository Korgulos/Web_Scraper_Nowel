Chapter 126: The Centaurs’ Request to Join the Empire 
TL: Sungmin 
The residents felt both moved and excited! 
They no longer feared Lin Tian; instead, they loved him dearly! 
At this rate, within just a year, the Goblin Empire could develop into a super empire! 
Its national power would be incredibly strong, unmatched by anyone! 
Lin Tian was very satisfied and instructed Ifreya to continue using Healing Rain. 
The next step was to produce high-quality seeds. 
They needed to be distributed. 
With pigs, using this method would allow the breeding of many wild boars, without fear of them running away. 
The second generation should be easier to raise. 
In any case, their production was much higher than cattle and sheep, with each household raising a few and each litter yielding dozens. 
It was worth noting that many people might not eat meat more than twice a year. 
Soon, Lin Tian could once again use the Life Simulation System. 
He planned to skip this development and waiting period, directly entering a state of peak national power, which would facilitate the next steps. 
“System, start Life Simulation.” 
[The Life Simulation System is starting. Current scenario: Breed Improvement, Establishing Prestige 
Under your great leadership, the humans of the Goblin Empire were deeply moved and saw a bright new future. 
They took the seeds and began cultivating them all over the mountains and plains, reaching 300% of the previous cultivated land! 
You also instructed the goblins to catch wild boars, break their legs, and distribute them two females to one male. 
The residents’ esteem for you even surpassed that for Charles II. 
Gradually, every day, many female residents came to the square, asking for your help with production tasks. 
Unfortunately, you could only help three attractive ones each day. 
The rest had to rely on other goblins. 
Three months passed. 
During this period, many scouts from the Sword Kingdom and the Magic Kingdom were captured. Their ambitions were unrelenting, waiting for an opportunity to retaliate. 
Six months passed, and the first batch of crops began to be harvested. 
The humans of the Goblin Empire had never been so busy, with yields exceeding previous amounts many times over! 
The whole country celebrated! 
After the harvest, the first thing the residents did was turn in their grain, often because they had no room to store it at home and had to pay taxes first. 
Another month passed, and the first batch of goblins had already grown. 
Every day, tens of thousands of goblins joined the goblin ranks in the royal city. 
As the available space of the royal city grew less, you started organizing the construction of new cities around it. 
Soon, two cities were built around the royal city specifically for human residence, while the goblins lived alone in the royal city. 
Human engineers also helped build and plan many siege defense machines. 
The national power was growing immensely! 
A few more months passed, and the first generation of wild boars had grown. Each household could hand over more than ten pigs. 
The food reserves now surpassed many great empires, rivaling super empires. 
… 
The current longest progress in the Life Simulation was one year, and it ended forcibly. 
Summary: The barbaric growth of the basic national power laid the foundation for the status of the Goblin Empire!

“Would you like to transmigrate to the new scenario: The Empire of Barbaric Growth?” 
“Transmigrate…” 
“Shush!” 
A surge of stimulation flooded his brain. 
Lin Tian slowly opened his eyes, standing in the kingdom’s square, with residents from all over the kingdom gathered below to worship. 
“Long live Goblin Majesty!” 
“I am willing to produce more goblins for His Majesty, to protect this country well!” 
“That’s right, I am willing to join the legion and contribute to this empire!” 
Residents were moved to tears, filled with excitement. 
Many had come from far away just to catch a glimpse of Lin Tian, this so-called new king. 
The image of the evil and ugly goblin was completely reversed at this moment! 
Lin Tian cleared his throat, “Just live well. Although I am an evil goblin, I promised to treat you as the people of the Goblin Empire, and I will do my best to protect you. 
Of course, if we encounter humans from other countries, I will not be so merciful.” 
“His Majesty is wise!” 
The residents’ emotions ran even higher, feeling fortunate that the goblins ruled this kingdom. 
They were also grateful they hadn’t fled like some. 
Many residents who had escaped from the Lionheart Empire begged to return, only to be slaughtered and devoured. 
It wasn’t that Lin Tian was merciful to humans, but he saw this batch of humans as his subjects. 
A necessary condition for developing national power. 
Gradually, after the residents left, they began to transform the lion statue in Lionheart City into a statue of Lin Tian. 
Turning his head, Lin Tian saw that Gobu Kuang and the others were present. 
Lin Tian asked, “Princess Alice, how many troops do we have now?” 
Alice responded, “Gobu Yue’s count stands at two million low-level goblins, thirty thousand big variants, and ten thousand hero variants. There hasn’t been an increase in leader variants over the past year.” 
She currently served as the highest commander of the Goblin Empire’s soldiers. 
Lin Tian was slightly taken aback—two million! Even if the low-level goblins were extremely weak, this number could still contend with hundreds of thousands of elite troops. 
He marveled at the terrifying speed of development. 
There were pros and cons to this; other empires certainly wouldn’t sit idly by. 
He believed they would soon form a coalition to attack him. 
“Boss! Several thousand demihuman monsters are requesting to see you!”  
At this moment, Gobu Tian flew over, gasping for breath. 
Lin Tian’s expression changed slightly. From the way Gobu Tian described it, it certainly wasn’t the cannibal eagles. He hurried out to see the situation. 
The group arrived outside the city gate. 
From afar, they heard the resounding and impactful sound of warhorse hooves! 
Lin Tian furrowed his brow. “Humans?” 
Only humans rode horses, so he suspected as much. 
Gobu Tian quickly explained, “They’re not humans. They’re a half-human, half-horse monster race.” 
“Centaurs?!” Alice chimed in. 
Half-human, half-horse—that had to be them. 
They had once been the most ferocious and powerful monster race in the Sword Kingdom. 
Unfortunately, after their defeat, they vanished without a trace. 
He hadn’t expected them to appear here. 
Sure enough. 
From the city wall, they saw a vast number of half-human, half-horse beings wandering outside! 
When they saw Lin Tian and his group, the centaur leader immediately bent over and saluted. “Greetings, Goblin Majesty!” 
This leader wore light armor, with her human half having fair skin, looking just like a youthful maiden. 
Lin Tian examined her attribute panel.

Description: The daughter of the previous leader of the centaurs within the Sword Kingdom, she leads her people in hiding, waiting for the day of revenge.] 
Seeing her information, Lin Tian was surprised to find he could now view skill details and descriptions. 
However, her strength was also considerable. 
Importantly, she was very beautiful, with four jade-like legs and four jade-like feet at once. 
One wish, multiple satisfactions. 
Back to the main point, Lin Tian spoke, “No need to be so courteous. You don’t intend to attack me with just these few people, do you?” 
“No, no, no, you’ve misunderstood. We want to join your empire,” Fiona quickly explained. 
This decision had been deliberated for a long time. 
Most of the tribe strongly opposed it because these were goblins, after all. 
Bloodthirsty and lecherous, enemies of all races. 
But the centaurs had been pushed to the brink, unable to even survive furtively. 
Learning about the terrifying development speed and food abundance of the Goblin Empire, Fiona decided to take a gamble. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian was slightly stunned. “Join us?” 
Fiona hurriedly replied, “Yes, we share a common enemy—humans, the Sword Kingdom. We can be absolutely loyal and agree to whatever you say!” 
“Leader…”  
Behind her, a few centaurs had complex expressions. 
Seeing Fiona’s servile posture pained them deeply. 
Lin Tian suddenly flashed a mischievous smile. “I see. Of course, you can join. But you said you’d agree to anything—really?” 
“The centaurs never lie!” Fiona said firmly, her clear eyes full of sincerity. 
Lin Tian raised an eyebrow. “Then, show me your sincerity now.” 
With that, Lin Tian walked down. 
Alice wanted to stop him, but he signaled her not to. 
Seeing Lin Tian’s evil grin, Fiona, no longer a child, understood the burden of her tribe’s revenge. 
She hesitated but knew what it meant. “Here?” 
“Do you think goblins care about the location? Did you not learn anything about us before coming?” Lin Tian said with a look of surprise. 
Fiona’s face flushed with shame, reddening to her neck. 
Biting her lip, she decided to agree to Lin Tian. 
She began to remove her armor. 
“Leader! Don’t!” 
“We can find another place to live; we can solve the food issue somehow!” 
“You haven’t married yet, Your Majesty. Let me do it!” 
Behind her, the centaurs felt an immense heartache. 
However, Fiona persisted in her decision, saying, “Don’t forget, we centaurs have lived on that land for generations. It was the people of the Sword Kingdom who took everything from us. Compared to that, this sacrifice is nothing.” 
Just as the last piece of white cloth was about to come off, everyone’s hearts raced. 
They seemed to be expecting something. 
However, what they expected did not happen. 
Lin Tian’s eyes widened in surprise. “I never expected it. Centaurs truly fulfill a single wish doubly. I’ve always been curious about your anatomy.” 
Seeing everything clearly, Lin Tian realized that the front legs and the back legs were entirely separate structures and organs. 
Lin Tian accepted Fiona’s sacrifice without hesitation. 
“This… this!!” 
Seeing what was happening before them and hearing Fiona’s gasping breaths, the centaurs behind gritted their teeth in hatred but dared not act. It was too sudden, both expected and unexpected! 
What was going on?! 
The goblin before them was now the king of a powerful empire! He wasn’t some lowly monster from the wilderness, yet he behaved just like any low-level goblin by the roadside. 
Shameless! 
They had thought this was just Lin Tian testing them. 
Surely, he wouldn’t actually do it. 
But now, they had overestimated goblins as creatures. 
The rice was cooked; if the other side went back on their word, they’d lose both their leader and their dignity. 
Eventually. 
Fiona, her face flushed, spoke despite her shame, “Now, can we join you?” 
“No.” 
Lin Tian pulled up his pants and walked back to the city wall. 
Those two short words struck the centaurs’ minds like thunder, almost making them explode! 
“What do you mean? You defiled our leader and now say no?!” 
“Goblin! Goblin!!! Don’t go too far!” 
“I told you not to trust goblins, these lowly, despicable creatures! Lady Fiona, sob, sob…” 
Some centaurs were so furious they stomped the ground violently, causing a loud rumbling. 
Several female centaurs wept in grievance for Fiona. 
Lin Tian smiled faintly. “Is this what it feels like to be in a position of power? Surprisingly enjoyable.” 
In the future, he wouldn’t need to do anything, and people would come to him. 
Surely many races, even humans, would want to join the Goblin Empire. 
Thinking of this excited Lin Tian, anticipating daily free indulgences. 
However, 
He eventually said, “Don’t be anxious. You can join, but there’s one more condition: all your females must bear new offspring for the goblins.” 
Centaurs were natural cavalry! 
Cavalry had a significant advantage over infantry. Training a large number of goblin cavalry would elevate the empire’s power to new heights. 
“Enough! Come down and fight me one-on-one; I’ll kill you!!!” 
A male centaur roared with all his might. 
He couldn’t trust them anymore, and it was impossible to do such a thing. 
Lin Tian turned his head and walked away. “Do as you please. I’m not losing out, quite the opposite. Let’s go; you’re weaklings, only fit to be toyed with.” 
He then turned back, casting a sinister, chilling look at them. 
Coldly, he said, “And if you step even one meter closer, I’ll consider it a declaration of war against the Goblin Empire… And you will die…” 
Thud! 
The centaurs’ hearts trembled with inexplicable fear, and their backs chilled! 
This was a real threat of death. They all swallowed hard and instinctively stepped back. 
As they watched Lin Tian turn away. 
Fiona called out, “Wait! We… we agree to your terms!” 
“Leader! How can you agree to this? It sounds nice, seeking protection, but in reality, it’s just becoming breeding tools for the goblins!” 
Some centaurs objected, filled with reluctance. 
Lin Tian stopped, chuckling. “Seeking protection? Do you know how many subordinates died and how much blood I shed to build this empire? Do you think you can just come and freeload? Dream on.” 
Hearing this. 
The centaurs fell silent. 
He had a point; they had been too naive, and they shouldn’t have come here. 
“However, if you can provide me with information about Goblin King variants, I might lessen the number of your people who need to breed for us.” Lin Tian added. 
It had been a year already. 
He needed to think of a way for Gobu Kuang to evolve, lest the child suffer from pent-up frustration.
