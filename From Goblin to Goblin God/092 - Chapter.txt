Chapter 92: Obtaining the Magic Tool, Farewell to the Dwarf Kingdom! 
TL: Sungmin  
After a long while, Bill slightly recovered. 
He explained, “The Spear of Zeus consumes a lot of energy. Only those with abundant energy can use it effectively without becoming weak.” 
This characteristic was very fitting for Zeus, the chief of the Olympian gods. 
Zeus was indeed full of energy. 
No wonder Bill couldn’t handle it after just one use. 
This was also why he recreated the Spear of Zeus for Lin Tian. 
After all, he had taken down hundreds of people in the tavern. 
“So that’s how it is. But this thing… against the undead and the holy types…” 
Lin Tian was pleased, but his main reason for having the magic tool made was to deal with the Great Tomb and the Church. 
It seemed that the Spear of Zeus didn’t have any special properties against them. 
Bill explained, “The Spear of Zeus can restrain the undead and balance out the holy types, making it the best choice.” 
Suddenly, Lin Tian understood. 
Even though Lin Tian was a monster, he could still use it, as dwarves were also a type of monster. 
Olympian gods were somewhat different from the God of the Church. 
Even monsters could use the power of the Olympian gods because their power came from nature. 
Zeus, thunder. 
Poseidon, the sea. 
“I see. Thank you, Master Bill.” 
Lin Tian was about to leave. 
He was suddenly called back, “Wait, it hasn’t been bound yet. Drip your blood into the refining liquid. Only then can you summon it back directly when you throw it.” 
Magic tools were different from regular weapons. 
Moreover, this was a half moon-class item. 
Lin Tian cut his palm and dripped blood into the strange refining liquid. 
Suddenly. 
Bill’s brows furrowed slightly, showing a hint of surprise as he held the spear, hesitating to put it into the refining liquid. 
“What’s wrong, Master?” 
Lin Tian asked in confusion. 
Bill looked at him, a trace of fear flashing in his eyes, but he quickly recovered. 
He completed the refining of the Spear of Zeus. 
Only then did Lin Tian truly possess it. No one but him could unleash its power, and others would even be harmed by it. 
With the item in hand, Lin Tian didn’t linger. After leaving a letter, he headed straight for the city outskirts. 
The letter’s main message was about going out on an adventure and leading the dwarves back to the surface. 
This would not only dispel any doubts but also establish a more majestic image in the dwarves’ hearts. 
The plan went smoothly. 
No one discovered him along the way. 
But when he reached the cliff path, just a step away from the outside, a familiar figure suddenly appeared! 
It was Bill! 
“Your Highness Dennis, no, what is your real name?” 
Now, Bill wore ancient silver armor and held an imposing warhammer, probably of world-class quality. 
He was no longer the amiable person from before. 
In his youth, he was the number one warrior of the dwarves. 
Lin Tian’s expression changed, warily asking, “Master Bill, what is this?” 
Bill laid it all out, “Stop pretending. Your blood was green just now. You’re not a dwarf at all. Instead, only one race has blood similar to ours, and that’s… goblins!” 
“What are you talking about?” 
Lin Tian squinted his eyes, already intent on killing. 
The dwarves still had their uses. Although Bill was valuable, he was not worth more than the entire dwarf race. 
If he let Bill go back, the image he had built would collapse. 
Despite his wrinkles, Bill’s eyes were sharp and shrewd. “The space magic ring is probably filled with the magic tools we’ve crafted recently, right?” 
“Why bother… I really don’t want to kill you.” 
Lin Tian instantly vanished from his spot, transforming into his hideous goblin form, appearing behind Bill. 
He pounced, pinning Bill to the ground, stomping on him hard. 
His strength was over five thousand, while Bill’s was only two or three thousand. 
There was no comparison. 
He also manipulated the Life Armor to envelop the hammer, embedding it deeply into the ground. 
Bill didn’t even have the chance to use his world-class weapon. 
“So you really are a goblin, a high-tier one? I was just curious why you went to such lengths to obtain so many magic tools instead of simply stealing them. Such cunning.” 
Bill couldn’t help but marvel. 
Looking at Lin Tian’s sharp teeth and blood-red eyes, he said. 
The pressure was immense. 
Lin Tian didn’t rush to kill him. He explained, “What else? Of course, it’s to fight the Great Tomb and the Church. I come from the Lionheart Empire.” 
“What?! The Great Tomb… the Church! No wonder you had me craft those weapons. It seems your strength far surpasses that of our entire kingdom.” Bill was still awestruck. 
He had heard of the Great Tomb and the Holy Church. 
To be able to oppose such forces, Lin Tian’s strength was unimaginable to him. 
Sighing, Bill added, “I see you’re a high-tier intelligent species and seem to have no malice towards us. I just hope that when the time comes, you can lead the dwarves back to the surface. I believe under your influence, they might even serve you.” 
In the past few months, Lin Tian had been the focal point of the entire Dwarf Kingdom. 
Bill had been keeping an eye on him. 
Even now that he knew Lin Tian was a goblin, with his wisdom, he would definitely not harm the dwarves. 
Instead, he would make good use of them. 
If Lin Tian were human, Bill would fight to the death. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian retracted the Life Armor and released his foot. “Master Bill, I’m glad you understand me. If we meet again in a few months, I would welcome the dwarves to join my empire.” 
Empire? 
Bill’s eyelid twitched as he watched Lin Tian’s departing figure in astonishment. 
“I never expected that after decades of the dwarves staying underground, the outside world has changed so much that even goblins have plans to establish a nation…” 
He sighed, rubbing his old waist that had almost been broken, and slowly made his way back. 
Lin Tian’s plan to establish a nation was not just idle talk. 
If his tribe could survive the great battle in two months, the remaining resources would be enough to establish a nation. 
On one side was the Great Tomb, on the other was the Lionheart Empire. 
If he could annex them all, 
he could even create a force not weaker than those super empires. 
After leaving the Dwarf Kingdom, he whistled, and Xiao Huan excitedly flew down. 
He immediately headed towards the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
After several months, who knew what had happened there? 
On the way, Lin Tian passed through the Lionheart Empire, his expression grave.  
“Wow, so many people are heading towards the imperial city, and they’re still recruiting soldiers!?” 
On every small and large road, there were groups of travelers with large and small bags on their way. 
Like ants returning to their nest. 
“But no matter how many there are, I will surely win this time.” 
Lin Tian accelerated, sweeping across the sky. 
The space ring on his hand emitted a faint black glow. 
This was the glow of victory. 
… 
The Tian Kuang Tribe. 
It was like a bustling marketplace, noisy and chaotic, with people feeling uneasy and somewhat agitated. 
Because there were simply too many goblins now. 
And a large number of breeding monsters. 
On the eastern side of the valley, the area was densely packed with low-level goblins. 
The breeding ground for monsters was built there, producing frantically day and night. 
Gobu Yue specifically captured low-level monsters like pigs, cows, dogs, and rats to breed goblins. 
They had many mammary glands. 
A single litter could be raised directly. 
In three months, they had produced fifty thousand low-level goblins! 
Additionally, other high-tier monsters had produced about ten thousand, all of which had evolved into big variants. 
As for hero variants, they hadn’t started developing yet. 
That would consume too many resources and flesh, so they would decide after Lin Tian returned. 
“Wow, it’s so lively here!” 
From a distance, Lin Tian noticed and heard the situation inside the tribe. 
He couldn’t help but feel shocked! 
The sheer number of goblins was enough to make one’s scalp tingle! 
The eastern valley was almost out of space. 
He had to land on the western side. 
“Look, the boss is back!” 
When they saw the familiar bipedal dragon, the goblins were overjoyed! 
“Boss, oh my boss, I’ve missed you so much!” 
“Woohoo, my boss!” 
Hearing their bizarre welcome, Lin Tian had Xiao Huan breathe a dragon flame, burning them into a panicked scramble. 
He scolded, “Stop acting foolish. Gobu Yue, you did a great job. There must be fifty or sixty thousand goblins here, right?” 
After landing, he praised Gobu Yue with a pat. 
She replied happily, “About that many.” 
“Alright, Gobu Kuang, you three better not be causing any trouble.” 
Immediately, Lin Tian’s expression turned cold. 
The three of them stood at attention, not daring to move. 
Gobu Kuang scratched his head and grinned foolishly, “No, no, we just accidentally went out and accidentally raided a few towns, and accidentally captured a few adventurer teams…” 
“Boss, I followed your orders and monitored the Lionheart Empire’s movements, but accidentally provoked the Church and was chased for half a month.” Gobu Tian said awkwardly. 
“Hehe, I’m the most honest. I didn’t do anything.” 
Gobu Shan proudly puffed out his chest, as if he were the most obedient. 
Lin Tian glanced at the distant adventurers, tortured to the point of being unrecognizable, knowing exactly who was responsible. 
It was none other than Gobu Shan, who seemed the most gentle. 
Lin Tian sighed like an exasperated father, “You guys never stop causing trouble. Fine, here are some great treasures for you.” 
At this moment, Alice, who had been resting in the cave, also walked out. 
When she saw Lin Tian suddenly take out a world-class magic tool, she was stunned! 
“That’s–!” Alice exclaimed in disbelief. 
She had seen some things in her time, but world-class weapons were rare. 
Now, a real world-class weapon was right in front of her! 
An unprecedented shock hit her worldview! 
“The Void Dagger, Gobu Tian, you take it. It’s very powerful, so use it carefully.” 
In Lin Tian’s hand appeared a dark blue dagger, with a handle that swirled with a black hole-like effect. 
It could create a basketball-sized teleportation point, just enough for Gobu Tian to pass through. 
When attacking others, the damage would cause a void effect, impossible to heal or repair. 
A single stab would leave a void-like hole. 
The heart would disappear, the brain would disappear, and no one could save them. 
If it struck these vital parts, death was certain.
