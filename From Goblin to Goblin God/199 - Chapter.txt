Chapter 199: Dungeon Crisis, Veronica Unleashes Danger! 
TL: Sungmin 
“I’m coming!!” 
In the sky, the Flame Dragon Mother’s thunderous voice echoed. 
Alice responded with a hum, “Come on, Lady Sylph, are you ready?” 
“No problem!” 
“Wind Elemental Magic · Voice of the Wilderness!” 
Immediately, Sylph appeared mid-air, directly facing the Flame Dragon Mother from above. 
As the flames erupted everywhere, they were carried by the fierce winds, growing even more intense! 
The flames directly targeted the numerous Trojan heroes! 
There was no escape! 
“Boom! Boom! Boom!” 
The impact of the flames toppled and reduced vast areas of the surrounding buildings to ashes! 
An area spanning thousands of meters around the entire palace was razed to the ground! 
The scene was grand and extremely shocking! 
Gobu Kuang and the others were dumbfounded. “Oh my God, can you even play like this?” 
However, a mere fire elemental attack could not kill the Trojans, whose power was boosted tenfold by their hero abilities. 
They endured the flames and gales head-on. 
They stood firm in place! 
The Flame Dragon Mother, having exhausted her fire breath, was incredulous. “These guys, are they even human?” 
“Of course we are! We are the only humans who can rival demigods!” 
“Stop resisting, surrender now. Struggling will only add to your suffering!” 
“For the glory of Troy, I will take your heads!” 
A group of them declared confidently and arrogantly. 
Then they began to stride forward quickly, charging toward the others. 
Alice, supported by Sylph, could easily suppress a few of them, but Gobu Kuang and the others were struggling. 
They had severely underestimated the strength of these enemies. 
Fighting against a single layer of hero enhancement was manageable, but they hadn’t expected the enhancements to stack tenfold! 
Gobu Kuang’s Royal Domain couldn’t even unfold before being suppressed and dissipated by the hero’s power. “Damn it, these bastards, how can they be so damn tricky!” 
“What should we do? Should I go find His Majesty the Goblin?” Fiona asked anxiously, not daring to rush forward. 
This group fought with extremely vicious methods and coordinated seamlessly. 
There was simply no opening. 
Alice spoke up, “No need. Gobu Jian has already gone to bring reinforcements. With a hundred thousand goblins joining us, we can take them all down.” 
No matter how strong they were, they couldn’t withstand endless waves of soldiers. 
Skills could attack large areas, but how many times could they be used? 
If they used their skills first, it would mean they couldn’t counter the opponents anymore. 
“You probably won’t live to see that moment!” 
The Trojans began attacking frantically, aiming to eliminate Alice first. 
Suddenly! 
A beastly roar rang out, shaking everyone to their core! 
On the beam, a humanoid crocodile over five meters tall, the ‘King of the Nile,’ was rapidly approaching! 
Despite its massive size, it moved with the agility of a feline! 
It quickly reached the group, positioning itself between both sides. 
Upon seeing this, the Trojans were even more delighted. “Princess Sara succeeded!” 
They all recognized this demon king-level summoned creature, Sara’s strongest trump card. 
“Of course, she succeeded! Now, you have no chance to resist.” 
Facing such a powerful monster’s overwhelming presence. 
Gobu Kuang and the others swallowed nervously. Though they felt a bit scared, they were even more worried. “Impossible, how could the Boss fail?!” 
“He… could it be…” 
Alice’s expression faltered. Even though Lin Tian had been victorious countless times before, the pressure brought by this monster was too overwhelming! 
There was no hope of victory in sight. 
Even the Flame Dragon Mother was somewhat intimidated. No matter how strong she was, her power barely exceeded ten thousand. The Fire Elemental Dragon’s potential wasn’t very high. 
Unless it was a fully matured Crystal Dragon, Dark Elemental Dragon, Light Elemental Dragon, or Composite Elemental Dragon. 
The Ancient Dragon Clan wasn’t just the Flame Dragon Mother’s lineage. 
They existed in other places too. 
Her kin were mostly ordinary elemental dragons. 
Light and Dark Elementals were rare, almost non-existent. 
“Boss, the Boss couldn’t have failed!” 
At this moment, Gobu Kuang’s expression turned wild, and he shouted in denial. 
“Damn it, Gobu Kuang, Gobu Shan, let’s go all out!” 
Gobu Tian was trembling all over, gripping a Void Dagger, his killing intent surging! 
Gobu Shan, wielding Athena’s spear and shield, had already resigned himself to die. “If the Boss really got into trouble, I won’t live either!” 
“Don’t be reckless! The Messenger might still…” 
Alice was in the middle of speaking when she heard Lin Tian’s voice from behind. “What the hell are you three cursing about? I’m not so easy to kill.” 
In an instant. 
Everyone breathed a sigh of relief! 
Gobu Kuang and the other two were overjoyed. “Boss, you scared us to death! With such a powerful monster, we thought you were done for!” 
“Kekeke, powerful? Some things aren’t dealt with by strength alone.” Lin Tian chuckled coldly. 
“What?!” 
The most shocked of all were the Trojans. 
In utter disbelief, they exclaimed, “Princess Sara has already summoned that monster, and it didn’t kill this goblin? Impossible!!” 
In the distance, Sara’s figure appeared in their sight. 
Alice, Gobu Kuang, and the others immediately grew serious. “Boss, that woman is here!” 
“Your Highness!” 
The Trojan heroes were also somewhat excited, quickly gathering around her. 
Sara, with a grim expression, didn’t look at them or say a word. 
The group, still excited, began speaking eagerly, “Your Highness, we’re about to wipe them all out in one go!” 
“Victory is in sight! The glory of Troy belongs to us!” 
“These guys aren’t that strong. With you here, it’s an overwhelming victory! We wouldn’t have needed to resort to a sneak attack if we had known!” 
But just as they were getting carried away with their words— 
“Slash!” 
Suddenly, a massive bone spike blade, over seven meters long, came crashing down, instantly turning one of the Trojans into minced meat! 
The Crocodile Demon King opened its bloody maw, and with its powerful bite, it immediately took down another! 
And it bit with incredible speed! 
Three bites in a second! 
Three people were killed on the spot, just like that, without knowing what hit them! 
The remaining Trojan heroes were terrified and scrambled to flee. “Your Highness, what’s going on with your King of the Nile?! Why is it attacking us?!” 
“Because I ordered it to attack you. Go on, leave none alive,” Sara said coldly. 
As soon as her words fell, the Crocodile Demon King went berserk, hunting down every Trojan! 
This scene left everyone stunned! 
“Boss, am I dreaming? Why is that woman ordering the crocodile to attack her own people?!!” Gobu Kuang scratched his head, utterly incredulous. 
Lin Tian chuckled coldly, “Of course, it’s because your boss has already turned her into my slave.” 
“What the hell! That’s amazing!” 
“Brother Tian, is it true? That such a powerful and beautiful woman is your slave!!” 
“Long live the Boss! Hahaha!” 
The crowd cheered. 
But the Trojans were screaming in despair! 
They fled frantically, only to meet their end in pain and hopelessness! 
“Your Highness! Why?! Why are you killing us?!” 
“No way, Your Highness, you’re a Goblin’s slave?! Since when?!” 
“Help! Someone save me!” 
“A Goblin’s slave?! Princess, you treacherous woman! The kingdom won’t forgive you, argh!” 
As the last one’s screams faded, they all died under the terrifying bite force of the Crocodile Demon King. 
Its greatest strength was its jaws; even a ten-thousand-strength opponent could be severely injured on the spot. 
Since it couldn’t perform a ‘death roll’ unless its opponent was large enough, it would instead snap its prey’s neck in one bite. 
Instantly killing an opponent with a battle power of ten thousand wasn’t an exaggeration. 
As he looked at the corpses of the Trojan heroes scattered around, Lin Tian unceremoniously began devouring them. 
Ding, congratulations on acquiring ‘Hero’s Power’! 
He had only devoured one person and had already obtained this skill. 
A skill powerful enough to rival demigods! 
Lin Tian quickly instructed, “Gobu Kuang, you three hurry up and devour them too, see if you can gain Hero’s Power.” 
“Got it!” 
In no time, all three of them had acquired the skill. 
Unfortunately, the others present didn’t have the Gene Devour ability. 
The rest had to be left to Lin Tian, who absorbed them all as experience, just like the Holy Tree warriors he had devoured earlier. 
Level 104! 
Just a bit more to go. 
“What about those guys from the Giant Elephant Empire?” Lin Tian squinted, surveying the surroundings. 
Alice shook her head, “We haven’t seen anyone else; only these guys invaded.” 
“I saw them! A group of them already fled in that direction.” 
At that moment, the Flame Dragon Mother, having reverted to her humanoid form, landed and pointed to the west. 
The dungeon?! 
Lin Tian’s brow furrowed, and he thought to himself, This is bad! The dungeon! Let’s go, quickly! 
If that old monster Veronica were released, it would be a significant problem! 
Though her battle power was just over ten thousand, she could summon powerful aberrant creatures at any cost, leading to an aberrant invasion of this world. 
In the past, Lin Tian wouldn’t have cared about such things; an invasion wouldn’t have affected him. 
But now, after painstakingly accumulating so much wealth, resources, and soldiers, losing them would be a bitter pill to swallow. 
Hearing this, the group immediately rushed toward the dungeon, wasting no time!
