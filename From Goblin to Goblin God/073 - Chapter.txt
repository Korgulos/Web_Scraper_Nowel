Chapter 73: The Fallen Saintess 
TL: Sungmin  
Directly merging him into his own body would allow him to learn the skill of dream control, wouldn’t it?

Overall: 3800] 
This strength wasn’t high among eighth-tier monsters, as it couldn’t even defeat the Iguana Lord. 
However, the dream control skill was nearly unbeatable if used to ambush someone. 
Unless the opponent had a strong willpower and could realize they were in a dream. 
Lin Tian, with lightning speed, grabbed a dagger and dashed forward. 
Seeing this, the Dream Demon hurriedly activated the Etherealization skill, a unique advantage of a spiritual entity. 
Inherently possessing the ability to ignore attacks. 
Only magical skills could cause harm. 
“Not good! Don’t look into his eyes!” 
The Cannibal Eagle suddenly shouted, but it was too late. 
The Dream Demon and Lin Tian locked eyes, immediately activating the Bewildering Eye, which could forcibly hypnotize a person. 
Then, it used the dream control skill. 
Its large eyes emitted a strong red light, all of which poured into Lin Tian’s eyes. 
In an instant. 
Lin Tian seemed to be in a daze, staggering and falling asleep on the ground. 
Seeing this, the Cannibal Eagle’s large wings shook, swiftly attacking the Dream Demon. 
“Hmph, he’s doomed, Cannibal Eagle Lord…” 
The Dream Demon, full of disdain, then dove into Lin Tian’s dream. 
At this moment. 
Lin Tian, clutching his aching head, opened his eyes and got up, discovering that the surroundings had turned into a desolate, scorching volcano! 
The distant scene was distorted by the high temperature. 
He couldn’t help but start sweating. 
The heat was unbearable. 
“Damn, where am I? A volcano?” 
Lin Tian looked around in confusion, seeing no one, only endless volcanic rock paths. 
“Boom!” 
Suddenly, the volcanic crater not far away began to stir. 
A surge of golden, scalding lava spurted out! 
A large clump fell at Lin Tian’s feet, the ground sizzling and emitting a lot of white smoke. 
The heat wave made Lin Tian feel like he was melting. 
He thought it was an accident, but then the volcano erupted! 
Thousands of degrees of lava flowed out like a flood! 
Lin Tian kept running, but he couldn’t outrun it. 
He was engulfed and swallowed by the scorching lava. 
In the boiling lava, he saw his flesh instantly evaporate! The intense burning pain! 
It felt like he was about to die. 
In the sky. 
The Dream Demon laughed triumphantly, “Die forever with your dream, still wanting to kill me? Just a mere…” 
Before it could finish speaking, it saw a fire arrow shot towards it! 
There was no time to dodge, and it was directly hit and fell! 
The burning flames made it scream in pain, “How is this possible!” 
“This trick is good for fooling others, it’s too early to think about fooling me!” 
Lin Tian could be seen swimming and bathing in the lava. 
Indeed, the earlier experience felt more real than reality! 
If one’s will was not firm, they would really think they had died and never wake up again. 
He roughly understood its ability. If you believed you died in the dream, you would really die. 
It had tried to make Lin Tian think he was burned to death by the lava. 
Lin Tian not only didn’t die but could control his dream to fly, countless heavenly thunders striking down, shattering the entire dream! 
“Aargh!” 
In the dream, the Dream Demon suffered real damage, forcibly expelled from Lin Tian’s body, covered in wounds. 
Lin Tian opened his eyes, returning to reality, and while the Dream Demon was still disoriented, he attacked with his Elemental Hand Crossbow’s fire element. 
Unable to use Etherealization in time, it was ignited again. 
While injured, it couldn’t use Etherealization to dodge. 
It could only scream in pain in the flames, nearly burning to ashes. 
Lin Tian quickly rushed over and started devouring it, as it couldn’t etherealize with the flames. 
Bite after bite. 
Finally, he acquired the skill ‘Dream Control’, but unfortunately, despite eating most of it, he didn’t obtain Etherealization. 
That was the divine skill. 
He reached out to the remaining corpse, saying, “Abnormal Fusion!” 
A burst of black light shone from his palm, compressing the Dream Demon’s body into a small ball, which he absorbed. 
Directly merging it as part of his body. 
In the future, he could turn into a spirit and enter others’ dreams to control them. 
This was a skill that could only be activated under specific conditions. If an ordinary goblin devoured and acquired this skill, it still wouldn’t be able to enter someone else’s dreams. 
(PS: Previously, it was written to be able to give someone dreams; I think it’s more appropriate to change it to entering the opponent’s dream. Sorry about that, dear readers.) 
(Though it seems like an apology, it’s actually just padding the word count. Smiles smugly.) 
“Little Tian, you’re okay? You actually survived the Dream Demon’s power, unlike the Iguana Lord who suffered greatly!” The Cannibal Eagle exclaimed in amazement. 
He remembered that the last time the Iguana Lord came out, it went insane, killing everyone on sight. Who knew what it had experienced inside. 
Lin Tian shrugged, “I’m fine, let’s go.” 
This time, the harvest was quite rich, and he didn’t lose his lordship. It was fine to let Gobu Shan take over. 
Moreover, using Abnormal Fusion for the first time felt quite good. 
Now, in a sense, he was no longer a goblin but an undead. 
After parting with the Cannibal Eagle, Lin Tian returned to the Tian Kuang Tribe, planning to bring Gobu Shan to take over the Southern Lord position. 
At this point, the Sword Saintess hadn’t woken up yet, having exhausted too much energy, 
She slept for an entire day. 
Her sleeping posture was enchanting, though her expression seemed like she was having a nightmare. 
Lin Tian didn’t care and directly activated dream control. 
In the next second, his body felt light, turning into a wisp of black smoke that entered her mind. 
“Kill that goblin!” 
“And punish that whore, the Sword Saintess! She can’t be forgiven!” 
“How could she commit such acts while holding a holy position? It’s unforgivable!” 
“Shame! The greatest shame in the history of the holy order!” 
As soon as he entered, he heard a burst of noise. 
Lin Tian floated in the air, and below was a city with many people gathered in a parade of protest. 
Listening carefully, he heard someone sobbing. 
At first glance, he noticed a young girl surrounded in the center of the crowd, wearing a dirty nightgown, her hair disheveled, sitting helplessly on the ground, curled up. 
She covered her ears tightly, crying. 
“Isn’t that the Sword Saintess? What’s with all these people around?” 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but feel curious that she would have such a dream. 
He remembered her saying something about being harmed by the residents. It was easy to infer that the residents had coerced her into killing the goblin she birthed. 
But she, wanting to atone, couldn’t bear to kill it. 
That’s how the conflict and parade arose. 
The people she had protected now turned against her, making her fear and cry. 
Lin Tian’s lips curled up slightly, thinking it was perfect, 
This state was ideal for driving her completely towards corruption. 
“Buzz!” 
Suddenly, a beam of golden light appeared in the sky over the city! 
Lin Tian transformed himself into a figure shrouded in the golden light, with a pair of angel wings and a halo above his head. 
He looked down at the people below. 
Then he controlled those people to kneel, “Lord God! Lord God has manifested!” 
“Hallelujah! God, bless us!” 
“Finally seeing God, it’s wonderful!” 
Seeing this, Alicenia in her dream gradually stopped crying. 
But she still sobbed a few times. 
She slowly raised her head, her soul seemingly touched by the golden light. 
Having strived for the holy position for half her life, it was the first time she had seen God. How could she not be deeply shaken? 
Seeing her reaction, Lin Tian thought it was very effective, so he further controlled the people in the dream. 
A resident suddenly showed a fierce look, pointing at the Sword Saintess, “Look, it’s that witch! Desecrating the holy order, the Lord God has come to punish her!” 
“Kill her!” 
“She deserves to die!” 
“Unforgivable!!!” 
Everyone gritted their teeth, their hateful gazes like blades pressing against the Sword Saintess’s neck. 
Forcing her to step back repeatedly. 
Suddenly, she found herself at the edge of a cliff with no way back. 
Finally, Alicenia cried out, “Lord God, save me! Please forgive me!” 
Lin Tian waved his hand, and those residents pushing her back seemed to be paused, only the Sword Saintess could move. 
Then he spoke in a gentle, holy voice, “Holy one, Alicenia, do you know what sins you have committed?” 
“I… I killed the people I was supposed to protect…” 
Alicenia said, kneeling on the ground, tears streaming down her face. 
But Lin Tian shook his head, “Killing imperial soldiers and causing the death of comrades are minor sins. Accept your role and birth the goblins, and I will forgive you.” 
Upon hearing this, Alicenia was first delighted, then surprised, “Lord God, have I committed other sins?” 
Looking at the residents, Lin Tian said, “You are protecting a bunch of demons, selfish and petty people, greedy, violent, indulging in lust and wealth, holding high power, enjoying resources that should not belong to them! They are the demons… 
This sin can never be forgiven.” 
“Wha… what?” 
Alicenia was in a daze, unable to believe what she heard. 
The people she protected were actually demons? 
Thinking carefully, the hardships she had suffered seemed to be caused by them. 
Without them, her longtime comrades wouldn’t have died. 
She wouldn’t have been punished by God. 
The evil she endured, all granted by him, weren’t they demons to her? 
When she looked ahead again, those residents had indeed turned into red-skinned demons with hideous faces! 
They moved again, clawing and biting, attacking her. 
Looking again, Alicenia found herself in her platinum armor with her holy sword. 
Seeing this, Alicenia didn’t hesitate and charged into the crowd, starting a massacre! 
“You demons! Stop speaking!” 
The cold edge of her blade exploded! 
The ‘demons’ screamed and fled, but none could escape the sword’s judgment, blood flowing everywhere, forming a river. 
Alicenia, covered in blood, stood on the pile of corpses, panting heavily. 
But when she saw the bodies clearly, she was so frightened that she collapsed, dropping her sword, “How… how can this be! It wasn’t me!” 
Those bodies turned back into residents. 
Staring at Alicenia, they seemed to be accusing her of her crimes. 
Just like the battle at Bright Town. 
Lin Tian quickly comforted her, “Child, why are you afraid?” 
“Lord God, I killed people… woo woo woo…” Alicenia cried. 
Lin Tian walked to her, his tall and majestic figure, extending a hand, “I told you, they are no different from demons. You protected them countless times, yet they wanted to kill you. Who else but demons would do such a thing?” 
Amidst a series of manipulative words. 
Alicenia’s clouded eyes began to clear, filled with evil and darkness! 
She stopped crying and extended her hand. 
“I understand, Lord God…” 
This reaching out was like stepping into true darkness and corruption. 
Lin Tian’s eyes flashed with a sense of accomplishment, “From now on, you are to slaughter these demons.” 
“Then, how can I regain my holy power?” Alicenia asked anxiously. 
In her subconscious, she still wanted God’s forgiveness. 
Lin Tian thought for a moment, “When these demons are completely eradicated, and you must also help the one beside you, he is my messenger sent to punish the demons… remember!” 
After speaking, the dream shattered. 
Only endless darkness remained. 
Alicenia knelt in the abyss, seemingly never able to climb out. 
2k words. Break for a day.
