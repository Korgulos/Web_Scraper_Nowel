Chapter 231: Unease, the Holy Light in the Sky! 
TL: Sungmin  
Hearing that her magic power would be drained, the Zerg Queen hesitated. “Your Goblin Majesty, this…” 
Without her magic, she would be nothing more than prey at the mercy of others! 
Anyone would hesitate in such a situation. 
But now, she had no way to turn back. 
Alice, the One-Eyed Owl, and Sara had all freed their hands. 
Even if she still wanted to resist, she wouldn’t be able to handle so many opponents. 
Moreover, she had already forcibly evolved for production, leaving her with only half of her strength. Otherwise, she would be a full-fledged Demon King, completely fearless. 
But now, there was no use in saying anything. 
Like a gambler, she could only obediently offer everything. 
“Be good, don’t resist, sweetheart. I’ll treat you well,” Lin Tian said with a sinister tone, mimicking the Zerg Queen’s earlier speech. 
Then, he activated the Magic-Sealing Sword, draining all the magic from her body. 
The Zerg Queen nearly stumbled, her strength completely stripped away! 
Although her combat power wasn’t reduced to zero, as her racial abilities made her body incredibly strong—she still had around three thousand battle power. 
But to Lin Tian, she was now just meat on a chopping board. 
“Come with me!” 
Bringing the Zerg Queen along, the group slowly moved toward the front lines. 
Nearly a full day had passed. 
With Gegard and the half-blood soldier ants joining the fight, the demon insects had been completely wiped out! 
However, a few million other insects, sensing the danger, had fled. 
The wasteland was chaotic, corpses scattered everywhere. 
The ground was layered half a meter deep with flesh and blood, the stench of gore overwhelming! 
There were so many insect limbs and remnants that there was hardly any place to step, with piles of bodies from demi-human monsters and creatures forming mountains. 
The sticky fluids and blood from the insects had merged, creating several bizarre rivers! 
Anyone who fell into these rivers wouldn’t be able to escape, drowning alive, much like quicksand dragging down souls in vengeance. 
On the ruined battlements, Lin Tian felt an immense satisfaction. “Finally, finally, things can settle!” 
He scanned the battlefield with a sweeping gaze. 
Roughly estimating, there were only about seven to eight million demi-human monsters who had come to aid them. 
The mixed-blood ant soldiers numbered a bit over five million, plus a small number of goblins. 
In total, around fifteen million. 
“Boss! How is it, did you defeat the Zerg Queen? Have we avenged ourselves?” Gobu Kuang and the others rushed over, eager. 
If it weren’t for their voices, they would have been unrecognizable! 
They looked like grotesque meat paste monsters, covered in pieces of flesh and soaked in blood. 
Lin Tian nodded and ordered, “Alright, gather everyone and get them in line. You first, come taste the Zerg Queen!” 
Gobu Kuang froze for a moment, his eyes turning to the Zerg Queen beside Lin Tian, who was now slim and slender, almost as if she were wearing tight clothing. 
His eyes instantly widened in disbelief! 
“Boss, you’re the best! Hurry, hurry, line up!” Gobu Kuang shouted loudly. 
One voice spread to ten, ten to a hundred, a hundred to a thousand, a thousand to ten thousand! 
Before long, the entire army had heard the news, and they were more excited than they had been during the bloodbath moments earlier! 
“What! I, I really can? Even a lowly monster like me can taste the Zerg Queen! That’s a true Demon King-level being!” 
“The leader of billions, the founder of an empire that stood strong for thousands of years! And now she’s going to be our toy, hahaha!” 
“Long live His Majesty Goblin! Coming to support was the best decision I’ve ever made in my life! Hahaha! This is amazing!” 
“I get to play with the Zerg Queen?! Am I dreaming? Hahaha!” 
The soldiers shouted in exhilaration, their eyes gleaming like ravenous wolves! 
They could hardly wait, consumed by excitement! 
Seeing this scene, the Zerg Queen was dumbstruck. Trembling, she stammered, “Wha-what, what does this mean? Lord Goblin, did I hear you wrong? What did you just say? What are you planning to make them do?” 
“Hehehe, relax, it’ll be over if you just endure it, right?” Lin Tian grinned, his expression dark and chilling. 
Hearing his words, the Zerg Queen felt an odd sense of familiarity. “Lord Goblin, didn’t you promise me? Why… why are you doing this! I don’t want this, stay away from me!” 
Watching Gobu Kuang approach, the Zerg Queen’s face turned pale with fear. She clawed at the ground, desperately trying to crawl away, but she was powerless to resist. 
Gobu Kuang easily pinned her down beneath his foot. “Boss, I can treat her however I want, right?” 
“No.” 
Lin Tian’s eyes suddenly turned sharp. 
The Zerg Queen thought for a moment that he had changed his mind, and she was overwhelmed with gratitude. “Your Goblin Majesty, thank you! Thank you! Please, don’t let those demi-human monsters… don’t let them…!” 
“You have to treat her with the most violence! The most brutality! Hold nothing back! I want to hear a long and despairing dirge!” Lin Tian commanded. 
“Crack!” 
In that moment, the Zerg Queen’s heart, even her very soul, shattered! She screamed with all her might, “Goblin! You beast, I’ll kill you! I’ll kill you!!!!!” 
But alas, it was only empty words. 
“Let’s rest here in the city for now.” 
Lin Tian slowly left, planning to devour all the corpses of the powerful enemies. By doing so, he could increase his level and strengthen his combat power. Even a small increase was better than nothing. 
“Beastly Goblin! I hate you!!! I curse you!!!”  
Behind him, the rhythmic wailing of the Zerg Queen echoed, filled with despair. 
Looking at Gegard, Lin Tian said, “Even though this is our first time meeting, thank you for your help. Otherwise, I would’ve taken a huge loss this time.” 
“I should be thanking you instead. Otherwise, I would still be a rotting corpse underground.” Gegard spoke, bowing deeply with respect. 
Then, he added, “Your Majesty, I hope you protect the Goblin Empire well. Although it’s no longer the empire I once guarded, I’m very satisfied with your development plans! This homeland will surely become a prosperous city…” 
After his resurrection, Gegard had spent a long time experiencing life, and he was very pleased with Goblin City. That’s why he helped Lin Tian. 
Otherwise, it would have been considered a coup. 
“Of course, but earlier, I heard you and the Zerg Queen mention something about a Lord of Sin and a Gluttonous Demon King. What’s that about?” Lin Tian asked, concerned. 
He didn’t want another boss to suddenly appear before he even had time to reorganize his army. 
That would be beyond frustrating. 
Gegard paused for a moment, sighed deeply, and was about to explain when Lin Tian interrupted him. “Let’s find a quieter place. It’s too noisy here.” 
Behind them, the sorrowful screams of the Zerg Queen were unbearable. 
“Ah… sure,” Gegard said, a bit amused. 
Once inside the Zerg Empire’s city, Gegard continued, “Well, it dates back over two thousand years. During that time, the Uninhabited Zone was in what’s called the Age of Chaos…” 
“The Age of Chaos? What does that mean?” Lin Tian asked, intrigued. 
“The Age of Chaos was essentially an era of endless wars. Every empire and tribe was in constant conflict, raiding each other to survive because resources were scarce. 
That part isn’t important since times have changed, but I suspect the Lords of Sin have not. 
There are seven lords in the Uninhabited Zone, each representing a deadly sin: Greed, Pride, Sloth, Wrath, Envy, Gluttony, and Lust. All of them are Demon King-level beings with unique and formidable powers. 
At that time, an enemy nation sacrificed millions of their people to the Greed Demon King in order to destroy us. He led an army of monsters that ravaged our land, and I perished in the battle trying to defend it. However, even the Greed Demon King didn’t leave the enemy nation unscathed. 
It seems that in recent years, the Uninhabited Zone hasn’t paid much attention to this area, or you would have known about the Lords of Sin by now.” 
Gegard spoke with a heavy heart. 
Lin Tian raised an eyebrow. He had passed through the Uninhabited Zone many times, especially on his way to the World Tree. 
The World Tree was located in the center of the continent. 
He hadn’t expected that such powerful demonic beings lurked in the Uninhabited Zone, capable of wiping out ancient empires. 
Judging by what Gegard said, a nation that could sacrifice millions must have been far more powerful than the Holy Tree of the Giant Elephant or the Trojan Empire. 
Lin Tian gazed into the distance. “Demon King-level beings, huh? Heh, I’ll go find them for a little fun when the time comes.” 
For now, though, he needed to rest and gather strength. 
The thought of peacefully increasing his power without any imminent threats made him feel incredibly pleased. 
“I believe you’ll reach a level where you can crush the Lords of Sin. I, too, want to avenge myself by killing the Greed Demon King,” Gegard said, clenching his fists in rage. 
Looking at him, Lin Tian nodded. “It’ll be even better with your help. First, let’s go pay the Ant Tribe a visit.” 
The Ant Queen had helped them, and although Lin Tian initially planned to capture her and turn her into a breeding tool, it no longer seemed necessary. She had already willingly submitted and become a star wrath. 
Suddenly, a ray of sunlight pierced through the dark sky, catching everyone’s attention. 
Lin Tian watched from afar, sensing something strange about it! 
A beam of sunlight breaking through the clouds was not unusual. 
But this light—it was holy light! 
There was no way he was mistaken. 
A strange sense of unease began to spread through Lin Tian’s heart. “Wait, let’s go back. Walking around this empty city gives me the creeps.” 
Most of the troops were stationed and resting in the front line area. 
The entire army was lined up, enjoying the spoils of their victory. 
In numbers, they all felt a bit safer. 
Gegard was a little surprised but found it amusing. “Your Goblin Majesty, you’re a monster that crawled out of a pile of corpses, and yet, you’re afraid of ghosts? You’ve encountered plenty of them, haven’t you?” 
Despite his words, he still accompanied Lin Tian back. 
“Brother Tian, you’re back!”  
Osius and Grugia were resting on a giant rock, sitting together. 
They were with Alice, Gobu Kuang, and the One-Eyed Owl. 
Seeing them, Lin Tian’s unease began to dissipate. “Hahaha, have you enjoyed the fruits of victory? How does it feel?” 
He was already sick of the Zerg Queen’s body, disgusted by it. During the early days, the flesh mountain had been something the Zerg Queen had forced upon him. 
That’s why he felt so much hatred. 
“I don’t know what to say. I’m still reliving the memory! Maybe this will be one of the most precious moments of my life! To think I’d ever get to be with such a stunning beauty—a Demon King-level Zerg Queen! I never imagined it!” Osius exclaimed excitedly. 
Everyone began teasing and joking with each other. 
Lin Tian’s brow gradually furrowed as he stared at the prominent beam of light in the sky. The growing sense of unease intensified within him. 
“System, activate Life Simulation.” 
He no longer cared about the post-battle celebrations. 
First, he needed to use the system to check if anything unexpected was about to happen.
