Chapter 81: Dwarf Kingdom or Loli Kingdom? 
TL: Sungmin  
The Corpse Pope did not speak. 
The other monsters only expressed slight surprise. 
Not everyone dared to negotiate with the Bone King like the Succubus did. The two of them were quite the pair. 
Yes, a pair. 
Even though the Bone King was a female undead, her bones were harder than any man’s. 
She had deeply won the Succubus’s affection. 
“I have my own decision on this matter, and he has the ability,” said the Bone King helplessly but calmly. 
The Succubus snorted, worried, “If he controls all the monsters in the Great Tomb, isn’t that sending those monsters to their deaths? Most of them will be preyed upon.” 
“What, are you afraid of goblins?” 
In the end, this sentence from the Bone King made the Succubus shut up completely, not saying another word. 
Lin Tian couldn’t believe it either. Did he really just get the control of all the monsters in the enchanted forest for free? 
Although he couldn’t forcibly control the intelligent ones, he could still manipulate large numbers of the less intelligent ones. 
Crucially, he was also allowed to hunt and prey! 
Thinking carefully, Lin Tian realized. 
Everyone here was old and cunning, living for countless years. 
He was now the number one wanted criminal by the Lionheart Empire and the Church. They must want him to confront them, while the Great Tomb reaped the benefits. 
Really damn cunning. 
Then, the Bone King issued the final order, “From now on, you are the Southern Lord and Grand Lord. The tribe is permitted to hunt a large number of monsters, but you must take responsibility. Anyone who dares to invade the Great Tomb must be resisted with all your might.” 
“Thank you, Lord Demon! I will slay all enemies!” Lin Tian said insincerely, his expression complex. 
After that, there was nothing more. 
The Cannibal Eagle quickly understood, “Little Tian, let’s go.” 
After they left the Great Tomb, the creepy oppressive feeling finally disappeared. 
“Little Tian, I didn’t expect you to be so favored by the Demon Lord. From now on, you are the number one in this forest, outside the Great Tomb!” The Cannibal Eagle exclaimed, smiling broadly. 
Lin Tian smiled awkwardly, “Not at all. Let’s go, there are still many things to handle in the tribe.” 
After they parted ways, Lin Tian returned to tell everyone who had been eagerly awaiting the news. 
Gobu Yue was truly amazed, “Boss, you’re awesome. Such a strong figure treats you so well. I’m envious.” 
“Doesn’t that mean we’ve become cannon fodder? If we don’t develop, we can’t fight the Empire and the Church. If we do, we’ll be their priority targets,” Goblin Slayer said heavily. 
Lin Tian also sighed. After plotting against others for so long, he now found himself in a predicament with no retreat. 
The Church, which had suppressed a powerful undead like the Bone King for decades, was no joke. 
There was no confidence in dealing with it now. 
Even with the Sword Saintess, it wouldn’t be possible. 
So the ultimate plan was to bide their time, strengthening quietly. 
“I already have a plan. Don’t worry, the ultimate winner can only be me, not any other side,” Lin Tian reassured everyone. 
“Boss, can you tell us more about that Succubus?” 
At this moment, Gobu Kuang grinned foolishly and scratched his head. 
Everyone gave this big guy a sidelong glance. 
They thought Lin Tian would scold him, but instead, he praised, “You brat, you really inherited my genes. Your interests and focus are just like mine. Isn’t it just a Succubus? We’ll catch some to use as breeding tools.” 
“Alright, alright!” 
Suddenly, those who had been holding back, like Gobu Tian and Gobu Shan, clapped and cheered. 
Alice, who had been sitting dazedly on the side, suddenly spoke, “Are you sure you can beat those demons from the Church? I only remember being easily defeated that day, and it wasn’t even the Pope who acted.” 
Thump! 
Lin Tian’s brow furrowed. Even she was easily defeated? 
“If it weren’t for him, things wouldn’t have turned out this way!” 
Hatred and murderous intent flashed in Alice’s eyes, referring to the cardinal. 
So, she had concluded that the Church members were all incarnations of demons. 
Lin Tian quickly comforted her, “Don’t you believe in me? Have you forgotten my identity?” 
Hearing this, Alice was stunned, her emotions gradually calming, and she nodded lightly. 
“Everyone has just returned, rest for now. Ifreya, come over.” 
Lin Tian then went to a cave. 
Inside, candles were lit, and Ifreya was carefully studying magic. 
Hearing his voice, she hurried over, kneeling beside Lin Tian, “Master, you’re back. Are you alright?” 
“How’s the magic learning going? Are you confident you can master it?” 
One reason for attacking Clinforth was to snatch some magic books for her. 
If she ended up brainwashed and understood nothing, it would all be for nothing. 
Ifreya’s old magic book began flipping rapidly, “High-tier magic · Healing Rain.” 
Droplets of cool green rain fell around. 
Touching them felt refreshing and soothing. 
Generally, high-tier healing magic could heal most common injuries, which was already impressive. 
Those cases where one had been stabbed dozens of times were another story. 
Although Lin Tian didn’t know much about the process of learning magic, he was still amazed at her learning speed. “Not bad, keep studying,” he said. 
To be on the safe side, he took away all the books on offensive magic. 
He only allowed her to study healing and defensive spells. 
“Next, we just have to see when the Lionheart Empire and the Church will attack,” Lin Tian mused. 
He knew nothing about the Empire’s movements. 
But he could use the simulation ability of the system. 
All he had to do was think about hiding in the tribe and waiting for the plot to develop until the Empire and the Church attacked. 
“System, start Life Simulation.” 
[Life Simulation System starting. Current plot: Become the Grand Lord. 
Your luck is great. By accident, you have become the Grand Lord of the entire enchanted forest, but you are a pawn and cannon fodder for others. 
Caught in a strategic trap, you are in a dilemma. 
Days go by as you hide in the tribe doing nothing. 
Although your prestige doesn’t decrease, everyone urges you not to be so lazy and disheartened. You receive a declaration of war from the Empire. 
A month later, Alice and others feel the pressure from the Empire and the Church. 
They prepare for war. 
Three months later, Gobu Tian reports that they have gathered 100,000 elite soldiers, and the Church has thousands. 
Six months later, their army is fully prepared and begins a full-scale attack. 
Your tribe is like a pebble under a steamroller, easily crushed. 
Everything ends. 
Summary: Your laziness and disheartenment led to your demise. Despite great development potential early on, once you slack off, misfortune follows. 
Rating: 0/100 
Reward: 0 Life Points 
This life simulation is complete, with a time span of six months.] 
Six months? 
Lin Tian snapped back to reality. Six months was neither too long nor too short, just enough. 
Lying beside the soft Alice, he began to think about his next plan. 
First, he decided to develop rapidly and breed a large number of low-level goblins. 
They would be used as cannon fodder. 
This would make the Bone King of the Great Tomb believe her plan was succeeding. 
Secretly, he would cultivate a powerful elite army to sweep the battlefield. 
There were enough resources, so there was no problem cultivating them. 
But later, he would have to face the monsters in the Great Tomb and those perverts in the Church. 
Even if he raised 3,000 leader variants or even overlord variants, it wouldn’t matter. 
Their top combat power was overwhelming, capable of easily destroying thousands of soldiers. 
On his side, he was just a small soldier of the Great Tomb. 
The Empire could also be considered a pawn of the Church. 
When the pawns fought to the death, the generals would make their moves. 
The main point was symbolic. 
But there was no other way. 
“Could an army fight against those generals? Goblins are still too weak,” Lin Tian thought, frowning and sighing. 
Alice, resting, slowly opened her eyes and asked, “Messenger, what’s wrong?” 
“Is there any way to drastically increase strength to an epic level?” Lin Tian asked helplessly. 
Thinking hard didn’t yield a good solution. 
Alice pondered briefly, “It’s simple, you just need an item, like the ring on your hand.” 
Lin Tian was taken aback and looked at the Feitu Magic Ring he had taken earlier but never used. 
Suddenly, everything became clear! 
His vision had been too narrow, focusing on crafting ironware, which was useful in the early stages. 
Later, human soldiers had full armor. 
Goblins’ craftsmanship at best produced light armor; they couldn’t create full or heavy armor. 
If they had heavy armor—no, even stronger magic equipment! 
With a large amount of magic equipment, their strength would increase to an epic level. 
Lin Tian quickly asked, “Alice, is there a way to get a large number of magic items? I want to build an army as a trump card.” 
“No.” 
Alice’s quick and cold response almost made Lin Tian faint, bursting his bubble of fantasy. 
Then Alice coldly said, “Magic items are extremely rare for everyone. Since the dwarves disappeared, those who can craft magic items are even fewer. 
The Empire has only two, and the Church is rumored to have one world-class item.” 
Dwarves had the innate blessing of gods and could easily craft magic items. 
They lived by forging for generations and had excellent craftsmanship. 
Ninety-nine percent of the magic items on the continent were made by dwarves. 
And anything made by dwarves was of the highest quality. 
Lin Tian’s expression was complicated. “Do you know where there are any dwarves?” 
“I don’t know. They might be extinct or hiding where no one knows. They’ve been gone for decades,” Alice said. 
Now, Lin Tian felt it was difficult. 
Without dwarves, he couldn’t make magic items; he didn’t even know the first step. 
Asking others would likely expose his purpose. 
Wait, there was still the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother! How could he forget her? 
Ancient dragons had seen and known a lot. 
If even she didn’t know, then no one would. 
The next day, after assigning Gobu Yue and the others to breed new goblins crazily, he rode a dragon to Dragon Island. 
The journey was long. During breaks, he saw many young men heading towards the human capital with large bags. 
Lin Tian squinted his eyes, thinking, “It seems the Lionheart Empire is really going all out, already starting to recruit soldiers.” 
Six months; the time was enough.
