Chapter 207: The Ambition of the Ant Queen, or the Ant King? 
TL: Sungmin  
“Damn, this goblin is way too savage!” 
“Is he insane? Daring to kill Zerg people within the Zerg Empire?” 
“Keep your voice down! If he goes berserk, he might kill you too!” 
The group of demi-humans trembled with fear. They stared at the two green locusts lying dead in front of them, feeling both shock and dread. 
In the next second, Lin Tian turned his gaze toward them. “Did any of you just mouth off as well?” 
“No, no! Lord Goblin, we didn’t say anything!”  
“Please, come in, come in!”  
“Don’t look at me, I swear I didn’t say a word!” 
The pigmen and ox-headed creatures frantically waved their hands, their hearts pounding wildly in terror. 
Lin Tian put on an expression of sudden realization. “Oh! Is that so? Fine, then. Guess I’ll let it slide.” 
Since they didn’t admit it…  
He would just kill them all. 
This time, he wasn’t sneaking around, fearful and cautious like when he infiltrated the Dragon Slayer Guild.  
This time, he was merely paying a visit.  
Apart from the Zerg nobles, such as the Dukes of the insect and ant tribes, the rest weren’t worth worrying about.  
If he wanted to kill, he’d kill. 
“Roar!” 
With a roar, Lin Tian activated his Ruinous Howl skill. The ground trembled as if the heavens were shaking. 
The dozen or so demi-human creatures behind him immediately bled from their orifices and died on the spot. 
This was nothing short of a massacre.  
The surrounding demi-human monsters screamed in terror and fled in all directions! 
Before long, a large number of green locust soldiers were alerted and flew in from the sky to provide backup. 
Lin Tian sneered contemptuously. “Perfect, I don’t particularly like green locusts. I might as well exterminate the entire species.” 
After crushing them all, he grabbed one and interrogated it about the location of the green locusts’ nest. 
Without any hesitation, he began leaping across the rooftops, heading straight for their lair.  
He didn’t hold back at all. 
In a nest of green grass, locust corpses littered the ground, their sticky fluids and blood mixed together in a foul, putrid stench. 
The remaining dozens of green locusts kept retreating in fear. Their leader shielded them. “What… what are you doing? We’re part of the Zerg! How dare a goblin kill us!” 
“So what if I kill you? Your people talk too much trash, and more importantly, you’re weak. I love bullying the weak.” 
Lin Tian grinned wickedly, his eyes glowing an evil red under the dim sky. 
The real reason he did this was to eliminate a race that looked down on goblins.  
Or perhaps it was simply because of a goblin’s natural bloodthirsty instincts. 
And it was also Lin Tian’s instinct.  
If you’re going to do something, do it to the end. If you kill, kill the whole tribe. 
The green locusts screamed in terror.  
Before long, they attracted other Zerg species. 
A large number of black and white locusts rushed in to help, surrounding Lin Tian tightly. 
The green locust leader, seeing hope, cried out, “Thank you, brothers and sisters, for saving us! This damned goblin—I’ll kill you and then wipe out your entire tribe!” 
“Really? There are too many bugs. I’m afraid I won’t have enough to eat.” Lin Tian responded. 
At that moment, strange, rhythmic footsteps echoed from outside the massive green lawn. 
It sounded like many ants crawling. 
Rustle, rustle. 
Sure enough. 
Giant black ants, each about five or six meters tall, crawled out from the grass in an orderly formation!  
There were about ten of them. 
They all stood upright, their muscular bodies bulging with strength—it was hard to believe they were ants! 
They wielded long spears, emanating a fierce and domineering aura. 
These were soldier ants! 
In the ant tribe, soldier ants were powerful warriors tasked with defending their race. 
The green locusts, seeing their saviors, quickly knelt. “Honorable soldier ants! This arrogant goblin is massacring us—please, kill him!” 
“Hmph, let’s see how arrogant he is now.” 
“The ant soldiers arrived really fast.” 
The black and white locust leaders sighed in relief. 
From the sky, a familiar voice reached Lin Tian’s ears. “Apologies, Your Goblin Majesty. If not for the scouts, I wouldn’t have known you had arrived in the Zerg Empire! Welcome, welcome!” 
It was the ant scout from before, slowly flying down and greeting him respectfully. 
Hearing this, the locusts were completely dumbfounded. “Ant lords, w-what’s going on?!” 
But no one paid them any attention. 
Lin Tian blinked in slight surprise. “Oh, it’s you? Well then, I guess this makes things easier. I got a bit carried away and killed some locusts. That’s alright, isn’t it?” 
“Well… they did provoke you, so if you want to kill them, go ahead. The Ant Queen will understand.” 
The ant hesitated briefly but spoke nonetheless. 
After all, as long as the Ant Queen took responsibility, it wouldn’t be a problem. 
The Green Locust Tribe wasn’t really all that important. 
And just as those words fell… 
Lin Tian charged forward like a demon, killing the last green locust. 
This scene sent chills down the spines of both the black and white locust races, rendering them frozen in fear, unable to move or make a sound! 
It was only then that the ant person spoke, “Well, let’s go. Our lord has long wanted to invite you as a guest. He has great admiration for the goblin race and often praises them.” 
“Oh? Also, these locusts, one pitch-black and the other snow-white, let these soldier ants help take care of them,” Lin Tian said. 
Upon hearing this, the ant person hesitated. “Well… they haven’t provoked you, so maybe…” 
“Indeed, but they appeared at the wrong place at the wrong time. I just want them dead.” Lin Tian spoke lightly, his tone as calm as ever. 
Yet, it gave off an intensely evil and cruel aura, as if his power was so overwhelming that he could toy with others’ lives at will! 
Both locust tribe cheftians knelt down in a panic, begging for mercy. “Your Goblin Majesty, we were blind to your greatness! Please, spare us!” 
“Brother, if you don’t help me out here, I won’t be happy,” Lin Tian’s eyes narrowed, emitting an icy, terrifying aura. 
The ant person shivered, “No, no! Everyone, kill them all… wipe them out!” 
By then, the queen would handle the consequences. 
It wouldn’t matter much. There were thousands of insect tribes here—too many to count. 
“I hate you, goblin! I curse all goblins to die horrible deaths!” 
The screams from the locust territory echoed out. 
The surrounding insect spectators trembled with fear! 
At this moment, they all gained a new understanding of goblins. 
Brutal! Violent! 
Vengeful to the extreme! 
Even the ant person swallowed nervously, completely unprepared for Lin Tian’s ruthlessness. “Your Majesty, are you in a bad mood today?” 
“A little, but I feel much better now.” Lin Tian replied calmly, riding on the soldier ant towards the ant tribe’s palace. 
He was indeed in a foul mood. 
The fact that the Zerg Empire did not allow goblins inside was a real annoyance. 
This little show was just a small reminder to change their mindset. 
He had no desire to reason with them. 
And reasoning wouldn’t work anyway. 
Only through absolute cruelty and ruthless actions could he teach them the best lesson. 
Soon, under the ant person’s guidance, Lin Tian arrived at the massive golden dune kingdom! 
The sight of the ant nest, whether in his past life as a human or now, always left him in awe. 
Especially since these ants were magical creatures. 
The dunes alone stood hundreds of meters tall and spanned several thousand meters wide. 
And that was just the tip of the iceberg. 
The real kingdom lay underground. 
It was unclear how long they crawled through the underground tunnels, but they finally reached the queen ant’s palace. 
Along the way, ants of all kinds were busy working. 
Though considered demi-humans, they still crawled on the ground like ordinary ants. 
Thankfully, goblins had night vision. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to see anything. 
Ants communicated through pheromones and their antennae, as their eyesight was actually quite poor. 
“Welcome to my kingdom, Your Goblin Majesty! I’ve wanted to meet you for a long time!” 
Inside the expansive queen’s palace. 
Lin Tian was greeted by the sight of a massive, white mountain of flesh! 
He could see strange things wriggling within it, like a fat, bloated worm. 
It wasn’t until halfway up the mountain that he saw a portion of the ant person speaking. 
This was the true appearance of the queen ant. 
Due to her reproductive needs, her abdomen had swollen to the size of a massive flesh tube, hundreds of meters wide and over a thousand meters long! 
All around, worker ants were frantically transporting food and supplies for nutrition, while others carried ant eggs. 
Lin Tian politely responded, “Your Majesty Ant Queen, I appreciate the help you provided me recently.” 
“It was my honor. A legendary figure like you—if we can develop together with the goblins—could lead us to break through the Uninhabited Zone, even challenging demigods! Challenging the gods!” The queen spoke with pride. 
Lin Tian was slightly surprised. He hadn’t expected these ants to be so ambitious. 
However, one thing puzzled him. They were already planning to cultivate a new queen. 
Why did this queen still act like she had a glorious future ahead? 
Just as Lin Tian was about to ask. 
Suddenly! 
A sharp, bone-chilling sensation surged from behind! 
That kind of pressure—he had only felt it from Joan of Arc in her fully awakened divine form! 
Could it be that these damn ants planned to kill him? 
He quickly turned around. 
He saw a towering ant person, six or seven meters tall, with a shiny, reflective black exoskeleton, staring directly at him. 
The creature had four muscular arms. 
Its powerful mandibles were still stained with fresh blood. 
Its antennae twitched for no apparent reason. 
It said nothing. 
But just standing there, it made Lin Tian’s heart race with fear. 
At a glance, its combat power was 16,000! 
A Demon King-level ant person! 
“Don’t be surprised. He is considered the Ant King,” the Queen explained. “I can’t lead armies or fight, and my power is quite weak, so I gave birth to the Ant King to fight in my place.” 
Hearing this, Lin Tian let out a sigh of relief, but his brows furrowed again. “Then, Your Majesty Queen, can you control the Ant King?” 
“Of course not,” the Queen replied casually. “But his responsibility is to protect the ant race and lead it to greater strength.” 
With that, Lin Tian immediately understood. 
The plan to cultivate a new queen was definitely the Ant King’s idea! 
His sudden appearance was meant as a threat! 
Forget it. 
After all, the internal matters of the ant race had nothing to do with him. 
He spoke, “Your Majesty Queen, I am still at war with the Free Empire, and I came here to ask you for help. I need you to command the devil locusts to sweep through the Free Empire and seize all their resources.” 
The sooner he finished this conversation, the sooner he could leave. 
It looked like the Zerg Empire was on the verge of an internal conflict without his involvement. 
“Of course!” the Queen said with satisfaction. “You will be the first monster to challenge a demigod empire. I’d love to see such a scene. Leave the devil locusts to me.” 
“Thank you, Your Majesty Ant Queen. I will take my leave now,” Lin Tian said hurriedly. 
But the Queen seemed eager to keep him, “Wait, I want to have a deeper conversation with you. Don’t you think we are quite alike? If we join forces, perhaps we could create even more legendary myths…” 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian was taken aback. 
What did she mean by that? 
Wasn’t this Ant King planning to cultivate a new queen, seize control of the Zerg Empire, and pillage other continents? 
This was starting to pique Lin Tian’s interest.
