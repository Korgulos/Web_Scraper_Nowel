Chapter 220: The Strongest Power, the Zerg Empire 
TL: Sungmin  
“Hero’s Power!!!” 
An elder raised his staff and shouted, his body glowing brightly. 
“Pfft!” 
But in the next second, a sharp blade pierced through his heart. 
Alice withdrew her Ominous Blade, wiped off the still-warm blood, and searched for her next target. 
Not far away, the One-Eyed Owl also punched and killed a Trojan wielding Hero’s Power. 
Their goal was clear: kill those who possessed Hero’s Power first. 
After all, whenever a member of a family with Hero’s Power died, the power would transfer to the next most worthy Trojan. There was no worry it would disappear. 
For a moment, the entire city echoed with cries of despair! 
Without high-level combat strength, it was a one-sided massacre! 
“Kekekeke!” 
The goblins feasted on the tender flesh first. 
Then they captured a large number of females, indulging in them without restraint. 
The bodies of men fell one after another, blood flowing like rivers. 
After a grueling thirty-two minutes of battle. 
Glory, pride, and confidence had all vanished! 
Only sobbing and pleading remained. 
“Help, help! We won’t resist anymore! Please don’t kill me!”  
A man knelt on the ground, furiously bowing his head to the goblins. 
“Pfft!” 
The glint of a blade flashed. 
His head separated from his body, blood spurting like a fountain! 
The same scene continued to unfold elsewhere. 
Even the elder knelt, begging for mercy, “Great Goblin King, please spare my people. Kill me instead! They’ve already surrendered!” 
Gobu Shan smiled wickedly, “Killing you wouldn’t be any fun. Then you couldn’t accompany your family, could you?” 
The Trojan elder was stunned, a bit surprised. “Ah? Thank you, thank you, Great Goblin King, for your mercy!” 
“Yes, I’m very kind. So, I’ll just kill your entire family so you won’t feel lonely! Kekekeke!” 
As Gobu Shan finished, his hands morphed into long, sharp bone blades. 
With a swift motion, limbs and body parts flew everywhere! 
Many didn’t even have time to scream. 
Watching this horrific scene from the city walls, the King of Troy was at his wit’s end, unsure what to do. “Why! Why is this happening! High Priestess, what should we do?!” 
Now, he fully understood the difference in strength! 
Despair engulfed his heart and the entire city! 
“Sigh… There’s no turning back, Your Majesty. It was by your own hand that the fall and dissolution of the Trojan Empire were brought about…” The High Priestess shook her head and sighed. 
Beside them, the sound of dragon wings flapping filled the air. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother gently landed on the city wall. 
Lin Tian descended from her back, like a demon king of chaos. The desperate screams from within the city seemed to serve as his background music. 
He laughed, “King of Troy, come now. Let me see how you die for your so-called glory…” 
“Thud!!” 
The scene changed dramatically. 
The King of Troy knelt on the spot, frantically bowing his head, “Great Goblin King, I beg of you, spare us! The Trojans are willing to surrender! I… I don’t want to see the empire destroyed in my hands!!!” 
Leading an empire to victory was a supreme honor. 
But leading it to destruction was an unbearable disgrace! 
He couldn’t accept it. 
Lin Tian sneered, “No, no, no. I want you all to understand the price of choosing glory! Fools like you don’t deserve to live!” 
“I’m sorry!” 
The King of Troy continued to beg. 
At this point, regret was an understatement. 
He was so wracked with guilt that he felt as if he was about to be torn apart. 
“The fate of the Trojans has always been in their own hands? Hahaha, that’s hilarious! Today, I’ll show you that it’s actually in my hands!”  
Lin Tian took a deep breath. 
The sharp scent of blood filled his nose, mixed with the bitterness of regret. 
Beside him, the King of Troy continued, “I am willing to have my people produce goblins for you! We’re willing to give up everything, willing to become your slaves! Please stop, Great Goblin King!!!” 
If this continued, everyone would die. 
Watching his friends and family perish before his eyes was one of the most excruciating feelings. 
“Ahhhh! I’m begging you!!!” 
Lin Tian didn’t respond with a single word, nearly driving the King of Troy to the brink of collapse. 
He shouted powerlessly, his whole body trembling! 
Because every second, hundreds or thousands of people were dying. 
Hearing the heart-wrenching cries for help from his citizens, yet being powerless to stop it. 
Now, it had become a cat-and-mouse game! 
The Trojans captured by the goblins were either killed or played to death. 
If they had died in a fair and honorable battle, perhaps the King of Troy wouldn’t have broken down like this, but such a death was utterly unacceptable. 
Lin Tian simply watched, without answering. 
He now fully understood the immense harm that cold violence could inflict. 
Luckily, he was the perpetrator. 
But just then, a graceful figure flickered across the city wall. 
Silently, she appeared behind Lin Tian, pressing a sharp blade hard against his neck. “Make the goblins stop, or I’ll kill you!” 
“Sa… Sara!!! My daughter! You… you’ve done well!”  
Upon seeing this, the kneeling King of Troy’s eyes lit up, his expression changing dramatically! 
Excited, he jumped to his feet! 
Sara, with a serious expression, continued to threaten him. 
Lin Tian’s eyes darted around before he quickly called out, “Everyone, stop!” 
At his command, all the goblins stopped. 
As they had been forewarned, Alice and the others weren’t too panicked, merely pretending to be tense. 
“Who is that? It’s Sara, Princess Sara!” 
“Thank goodness, we’re finally saved! I never thought the princess would return to rescue us!” 
“I get it now! The princess endured among the goblins just for this moment!” 
“I feel so guilty! I even supported killing her!” 
The surviving Trojans were overcome with emotion. 
In such a desperate situation, being rescued, even by someone who had once killed their families, was a debt they were willing to forgive. 
Not to mention, she hadn’t done anything wrong this time. 
Sara continued, “Order all of your goblins to withdraw from the Trojan Empire and never set foot here again! Or I will kill you!” 
“Sara, is it worth it? They sent people to kill you, and now you’re not even a Trojan anymore!” Lin Tian feigned panic. 
Hearing this, the King of Troy immediately declared, “From this day forward, Muhammad Sara is restored to Trojan citizenship, and furthermore, she is the new queen!!!” 
“Long live Queen Sara!” 
“The savior of Troy!” 
No one dared to object. They even felt a deep sense of shame. 
Seeing her goal had been achieved, Lin Tian suppressed a smile. “Heh, they say it’s hard to guard against betrayal from within. Fine, you win this round. Let me go, and I’ll leave!” 
After Sara released him, Lin Tian didn’t say anything more and ordered his army to retreat. 
They disappeared into the horizon, swallowed by the sands. 
Upon seeing this, the Trojans were so moved that they nearly broke down in tears. The feeling of surviving such a disaster left them trembling uncontrollably. 
“Sara, I’m so sorry! You’ve suffered so much during this time!!!”  
The King was filled with relief as he embraced her tightly. 
The others began to worship her as well. 
Even the surviving elders clasped their hands high above their heads, bowing deeply in reverence. 
This was a salute to the highest honor. 
It also symbolized their recognition of Sara. 
Honor or desire. 
Either way, what Sara had longed for in her heart had been fulfilled in this moment. 
‘Honor.’ 
This was something every Trojan had been immersed in since childhood, something they all pursued. 
It was also the source of Hero’s Power. 
To obtain honor, one could even resort to any means necessary. 
Sara suppressed her joy as she looked at everyone offering her the highest level of respect. Content, she said, “As long as everyone has survived, I am already satisfied!” 
“I’m sorry, my daughter. You probably already know that I sent war gods to hunt you down. 
I’ve made two foolish decisions, and I’m no longer fit to be king. From now on, you are the queen!” 
The old king said, his face full of guilt. 
Upon hearing this, Sara did not refuse. She wouldn’t forget Lin Tian’s instructions. 
In the following days, she focused on managing and rebuilding the empire. 
After about ten days, she decided it was time to leave, letting the old king serve as the regent for now. 
After all, she had already planned to follow Lin Tian. 
Because Lin Tian’s glory was something she admired. 
In any case, her goal had been achieved. 
In the hearts of everyone in the Trojan Empire, she was the new queen, the greatest among them. 
Every command she gave was followed without question. 
If Lin Tian had forcibly ruled the Trojan Empire, there would have been hidden dangers, and they might have rebelled. 
Supporting a puppet king, however, was a different story. 
Sending them to their deaths could be accomplished with just a single command. 
“I must continue to remain undercover in the Goblin Empire, observing their movements. So, I’ll leave for now. Don’t even think about revenge; survival is the most important thing!” 
After making her announcement, Sara left amid the people’s pleas for her to stay and their ever-deepening reverence. 
… 
Goblin King City. 
During this time, the battles had not ceased; there was no time to rest. 
Although the major empires had been conquered, there were still over a dozen smaller nations. 
To prevent them from uniting and forming a formidable Great Empire, Lin Tian dispatched troops overnight to eliminate them all! 
The goal was to uproot every last one. 
The desolate land within the Uninhabited Zone was now ravaged. 
In a small empire, the final scream signaled the end of another conquest. 
Lin Tian wiped the blood from the Spear of Zeus, mounted the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother, and soared into the sky. 
Gazing at the devastated earth below. 
Perhaps for these empires, it was nothing but despair and death. 
But for Lin Tian, this was a rebirth, like dead wood sprouting in spring. 
This land would become his Eden. 
A place of carefree growth and expansion! 
No one could stop it. 
Such an achievement, whether it was Alice or the One-Eyed Owl, left them both full of disbelief. 
They couldn’t fathom that they had been part of this—nearly unifying the entire world. 
Of course, that was only within the Uninhabited Zone. Crossing beyond it was almost impossible, not to mention the challenge of defeating the demigod empires or the mythic empires outside the zone. 
“Let’s go. We can finally enjoy the beauty of life for a good, long while!”  
Lin Tian smiled with satisfaction. 
No longer worried about who might come after him, no longer fearing death in this brutal world. 
Because now, he was the most brutal of them all. 
Hearing this, the Flame Dragon Mother spoke up, “Have you forgotten about the Zerg Empire? Though they haven’t participated in outside wars for thousands of years, they are the strongest force within the wilderness.”
