Chapter 165: The Yeti Tribe, Snow Crystal Stone Production Line! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Goblin Majesty, the Spider Tribe can produce spider silk and craft soft armor equivalent to the twelfth tier for you, but it takes a long time to make just one.” 
A spider girl with eight long legs pleaded earnestly. 
Looking at those eight beautiful red eyes, Lin Tian nodded in agreement, “Not bad, the soft armor from your Spider Tribe is quite valuable.” 
Then, another monster covered in thick fur approached. 
Lin Tian had noticed it earlier in the Great Tomb Forest; it was from the Werewolf Tribe, an eleventh-tier monster. 
However, the Werewolf King before him seemed to have already evolved to the twelfth tier. 
The Werewolf King stood nearly five meters tall, with massive muscles, and its fur was as hard as steel needles. 
The stench of blood reeking from it was terrifying and overwhelming. 
Nevertheless, it respectfully bowed its head to Lin Tian, “Greetings to the great Goblin Majesty. The Werewolf Tribe has over three hundred females who can breed hybrid goblins for you. We don’t mind at all.” 
Seeing how sensible it was and considering its strength, which was about on par with Fiona’s, around nine thousand, Lin Tian agreed as well. 
Even the formidable Troll Tribe had joined the Goblin ranks. 
The smallest among them stood over three meters tall, with armor-like tough lumps covering their bodies, and mouths full of black teeth. 
Lin Tian also accepted them into his empire. 
Once these male monsters had bred enough goblins over a few generations, they could be cleared out or sent off as cannon fodder. 
There was no point in keeping them otherwise. 
They could not generate any economic benefit, and keeping them would even be a threat. 
Different species harbor different intentions. 
This was not only a common saying in the human world but even more so in the monster world. 
At this moment. 
A monster somewhat resembling Rebecca flew over from a distance. Its cool and refreshing attire was barely held together by a few black leather straps, leaving one fearing that any slight movement might reveal everything. 
The playful heart-shaped tail swayed back and forth coquettishly. 
Lin Tian frowned slightly. A Succubus?! 
How could a succubus be here? Wasn’t this a species from Hell? 
He couldn’t help but be on guard; these creatures were notoriously seductive and immensely powerful. 
“Your Majesty! Goblin Majesty! I want to join your empire too!”  
The succubus girl waved her hand excitedly. 
Her voice was so sweet, so beautiful. 
Just listening to it made one feel like they were ascending to the heavens. 
Many young centaurs were scolded by their parents, “Don’t look, don’t look, go back.” 
“Dad, I’m going to the bathroom!” 
“Brat, I’m going too.” 
… 
Lin Tian asked in confusion, “Why are you succubi coming to my empire? Isn’t Hell a good place for you? You’re not afraid of anyone attacking you there.” 
Hell was full of monsters. 
But only a few, like the succubi, could ascend to the surface. 
It’s said that even God was tempted by the beauty of the succubi, which is why He didn’t seal them away. 
With that figure, and such fair skin… even God wouldn’t be able to resist. 
Hearing this, the succubus girl giggled, “We also want to find a stable place to live. It’s a hassle to keep running around just to get enough to eat. If we could open a succubus parlor in your empire, that would be perfect!” 
“You want to open a shop too?” 
Lin Tian was a bit surprised. 
But opening a shop wasn’t a bad idea; it would make the empire more vibrant and diverse. 
It was too cold-blooded as it was, and he would find it boring and uninteresting. 
So he agreed. 
The succubus girl was overjoyed and gave Lin Tian a kiss, “Thank you, Your Majesty. Remember to visit often; no charge!” 
“Alright, I’ll be your first customer,” Lin Tian said with a mischievous smile. 
The succubus girl blushed slightly, “You tease, how about you take care of me right now?” 
As she spoke, she tugged on a strap in front of her and flicked it. 
“I can’t hold it anymore, I need to go to the bathroom!” 
“The bathroom’s full!” 
“What are they doing in there?!” 
It wasn’t just the centaurs; other male demi-humans were also becoming increasingly restless. 
Lin Tian still had matters to attend to, so he said, “Alright, I’ll come on your opening day.” 
“No problem!” 
The succubus girl said, then opened the gate to Hell and flew back. 
Meanwhile. 
Many other demi-human tribes had also arrived. 
Like the Mountain Sparrow Tribe, the Flower People Tribe, the Tree People Tribe, the Rain Tribe, and so on. 
Those who could work were allowed to stay; those who were of no use were immediately issued an expulsion order. 
This place was not a refugee camp. 
“Goblin Majesty, the youth of our Tree People Tribe can grow to twenty or thirty meters tall. They are excellent in sieging and assaults. Please shelter us!” The expelled Tree People elder pleaded. 
This tree person looked like it was already withering, with cracked bark all over its face and body. 
Its size was quite large, about ten meters tall. 
But it seemed so fragile that a light touch might break it. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian’s expression turned icy. “I’ll say it one last time—those who need to leave, leave. If you try to cling to me, don’t blame me for being ruthless.” 
The Tree People Tribe did indeed grow large during their youth. 
But it took them hundreds of years to grow from a sapling, and they had no way to reproduce. 
Only a madman would raise them for hundreds of years for nothing. 
At this moment, the Tree People elder was filled with despair, but he still wasn’t willing to give up. “Goblin Majesty, how can you be so heartless? Weren’t you once the lowest of all monsters? Don’t you know how helpless it feels to be weak? Please, save us!” 
“Are you trying to guilt-trip me?” 
Lin Tian narrowed his eyes, and a murderous intent began to emanate from him. 
Many other demi-humans were nearby, reluctant to leave, hoping to linger. 
The Tree People elder, with a defiant snort, began to root his tangled feet into the ground. 
“Hmph! Goblin Majesty, you forced me to this. If you’re so cold and unfeeling, then I won’t leave!” 
“Hmph! When I was a lowly goblin, did anyone protect me?!” 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but recall his humiliating past when he first transmigrated. 
To survive in a small tribe, he ate pig bristles and slept in an open-air dog kennel. 
If it weren’t for Gobu Yue, he wouldn’t have even had the pig bristles to eat. 
Bit by bit, he had built himself up. 
Slowly, he pulled out his elemental crossbow and adjusted it to the fire element setting. 
“Swoosh!” 
A fireball shot out. The Tree People Tribe’s greatest nemesis was fire! 
The Tree People elder, terrified, tried to flee, but it was too late. He had rooted himself so deeply that he had effectively jumped into the fire pit himself. 
He was instantly ignited! 
Even though his combat strength was over five thousand, he couldn’t resist the flames’ devouring. 
The older the tree, the more susceptible it was to fire because it burned more easily. 
“Ahh! Damn goblin! What have you done? It hurts so much!” 
The massive body burned with flames. 
The old voice kept howling in agony. 
The other demi-humans were terrified. Those who had been expelled immediately bolted, not daring to linger any longer. 
In just a few moments, the Tree People elder was reduced to a pile of ashes on the ground, scattered by the wind. 
This was a clear example to others. 
However, there was still one demi-human monster who refused to leave. 
“Goblin Majesty, our Yeti Tribe can store food and meat for you. Please don’t drive us away! We can also create extreme cold defensive zones to contribute to future battles for the empire.” 
A snowman with a carrot nose pleaded. 
Its hands were just tree branches pieced together, and it was a wonder it could speak and move at all. 
Getting close to it made the air feel extremely cold. 
Although the Yeti Tribe’s ability was impressive, if they entered the city in large numbers, the entire city would turn into an icy wasteland. 
It would be foolish to keep them. 
Lin Tian was about to melt it when he suddenly had an idea. “You can create extreme cold zones?” 
“Yes, yes! Exactly!” 
The Yeti elder quickly replied, full of respect. 
Lin Tian’s eyes lit up. “Alright, you can stay, but you’ll have to live in the mountains behind the empire. That area is near the Enchanted Forest, but you’re not worried about being attacked?” 
Despite this, the Yeti elder was overjoyed. “Thank you, Goblin Majesty! Thank you so much!!!” 
As long as they weren’t disturbed by powerful monsters or captured by humans to be used as freezers, they were content. 
Lin Tian was just as pleased. 
Yeti and snow spirits together… 
Couldn’t they mass-produce snow crystal stones? 
Upgrading goblin soldiers would be as easy as running a production line. 
As long as the Yeti Tribe created large-scale extreme cold zones, many snow spirits would be born. 
Lin Tian then explained his plan to Gobu Yue. “This task is yours to handle. Once you’re done, I’ll help you improve your strength.” 
“Boss, you’re so smart! It doesn’t matter if my strength improves or not; I don’t like fighting and killing.” 
Gobu Yue smiled broadly, seemingly enjoying the work. 
Lin Tian nodded. Although she said this, he still intended to help her increase her strength. 
Her potential even surpassed his own. 
It’s just that he hadn’t had the time until now. 
Before long, the entire Serpent Tribe arrived with the snake beauty Louise. 
The leader of the Serpent Tribe, an elderly woman, was extremely excited. “Goblin Majesty, you are truly kind! We will surely brew many potions for you! Louise, aren’t you going to properly thank him?” 
“Hmm?” 
Louise, flicking her red forked tongue, was momentarily stunned. She quickly bowed in thanks. 
The other members of the Serpent Tribe also expressed their gratitude. 
If they had legs, they would have knelt down. 
Lin Tian looked at Fiona. “Come on, you’ve been around the capital for a while now. Take them and get them settled.” 
“Me? Is that alright?” Fiona was a bit puzzled. 
Behind them, the centaurs and others were equally surprised. The meaning of his words was not ordinary. 
It meant she had been accepted into the inner circle. 
Recognized by the Goblin Empire! 
Lin Tian replied irritably, “What, you don’t want to do some work for my Goblin Empire?” 
“Of course I do, Your Majesty!” Fiona’s beautiful eyes were filled with emotion and gratitude. 
This meant that the Centaur Tribe had taken a significant step forward on the path to rising. 
The other demi-humans were also extremely happy and excited. “Oh my, this Goblin Majesty is so much better than I imagined!” 
“Being able to survive in the Goblin Empire is an honor for us, meow!” 
“Everyone, we must work hard and sincerely repay Goblin Majesty. We can also be recognized like the Centaur Tribe!”
