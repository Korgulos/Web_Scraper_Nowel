Chapter 100: The Crown, or the Future 
TL: Sungmin  
Everyone frowned and looked in unison towards the sound. 
Goblin Tian returned with some injuries, his face full of anxiety. 
“Ifreya.” 
Lin Tian only called her once, and she understood to go and treat Goblin Tian’s injuries first. 
Then she asked, “Don’t worry, what do you mean by ‘we need to escape immediately’?” 
Goblin Tian recovered, but his breath and emotions were still very agitated, “The Lionheart Empire has gathered one hundred thousand fully-armored soldiers!!!” 
Thunk! 
This sound sent a jolt through Lin Tian’s heart! 
One hundred thousand fully-armored soldiers! 
One must know that the combat strength of a fully-armored soldier was considerable. 
Fully protected from head to toe, they were impervious to blades and spears, although their movements were much slower compared to light armor, they could slowly wear down powerful opponents. 
But now, the Lionheart Empire had actually created one hundred thousand fully-armored soldiers. 
Lin Tian suddenly realized why the system simulation had led to his certain death previously. 
“Is the Lionheart Empire emptying its treasury to fight this battle? Even if they don’t lose, with heavy casualties, they could easily be swallowed up by enemy nations.” 
Upon hearing this, Alice’s expression also became solemn. 
No one had expected that this lion, once enraged, could be so formidable. 
No wonder people said that a lion, even when hunting a rabbit, used all its strength. 
They had underestimated the seriousness of their opponent. 
Goblin Slayer shook her head, “We should leave. When the time comes, I’ll control an overlord variant of a super-large tribe, and we still have a chance to make a comeback.” 
However, Lin Tian’s expression was firm, “Leave? Where would we go with so many goblins?” 
Looking across the entire continent. 
There wasn’t a single inch of land where goblins could find refuge. 
They could only survive by hiding, unless they were Goblin Kings, but they wouldn’t live long before being exterminated by humans or other races. 
Born seemingly only to be experience points for others. 
Even Alice believed there was no chance of winning, “Messenger, we need to be patient, because if the church members join in, we could very likely face total annihilation.” 
“Yes, boss. The church has recalled about five thousand people from around the world, five hundred of them are Holy Guards in armor wielding great swords, and the other monks are also quite powerful.” Goblin Tian explained further. 
He remembered being chased just moments ago by a large group of holy men. 
Lia’s expression turned sad and dejected, “So, are you saying we have no chance of winning, and all our efforts so far would be in vain?” 
Everyone’s mood became somewhat gloomy. 
They hadn’t expected the opponent’s combat power to reach such a crushing level. 
However, Lin Tian didn’t care about the lives of these small goblins or big variants at all; they had to fight if there was any chance. 
If they didn’t fight, there would never be a way to turn things around. 
By fighting, they could force the people from the Great Tomb to take action. 
Only then would there be a chance for mutual destruction, giving Lin Tian the opportunity to reap the benefits on the battlefield. 
“Use all our strength! In these few days, create more ironware and iron armor! Get to it immediately!” 
Lin Tian’s voice rose a few notches, initiating action. 
The somber mood of the crowd was also affected. 
Everyone began to work. 
The mighty goblin army began to charge into the depths of the Great Tomb. 
They didn’t spare a single iron ore. 
Now, the intelligence of small goblins was equivalent to that of big variants, fully understanding what they needed to do. 
Inside the Great Tomb. 
A water-screen-like projection played scenes from the forest within the dark temple. 
It was the three eyeless witches, sharing their single eye to display the images. 
They were known as the ‘Black Witches,’ once humans who had served the church but were cursed by the Bone King Veronica, becoming what they were now. 
That eye was known as the Eye of God, not only capable of predicting the future but also of seeing through everything. 
Indeed, Lin Tian, who was anxiously searching for iron ore in the forest, sensed someone spying on him. 
But he didn’t pay much attention to it, luckily he hadn’t felt this earlier along the way. 
The snowfield side shouldn’t have been discovered. 
“What are they trying to do?” 
Rebecca asked in astonishment, remembering previous events, “My lord, that goblin was very rude to me before, but I endured it.” 
“Don’t worry, they are just pawns, destined to be annihilated.” Veronica said indifferently. 
She then looked at the Black Witches, “It seems a great battle is imminent. Predict the final outcome.” 
The Black Witches didn’t dare delay, holding the eyeball, chanting ancient incantations. 
Suddenly, the eyeball began to bleed! 
The pain made them scream in agony. 
“Lord Demon, this time among the participants is the Pope, we cannot predict the outcome, but I vaguely saw…” 
One of the Black Witches stammered and stopped there. 
Rebecca, impatient, demanded, “What did you see?!” 
The Black Witch hesitated for a long time before finally speaking, “I saw the birth of a new god…” 
The three Black Witches had exaggerated expressions, stretching out their hands as if in worship. 
Veronica’s expression turned sinister, “Nonsense, if there were a god, I would have been dead long ago. Get out!” 
With a wave of black magic like ripples, the three were blasted away, landing in the middle of the teleportation platform. 
It sent them back to the surface. 
“A goblin able to play such a role, my lord, you are truly remarkable.” Rebecca couldn’t help but praise. 
Although she disliked and resented Lin Tian, she genuinely acknowledged his abilities. 
Veronica hadn’t expected it either, “It’s time to settle things with the Lionheart Empire and the church. Let’s get ready and release that thing.” 
“Oh?! Yes…” 
… 
A few more days passed. 
The large furnaces Lin Tian had built didn’t stop for a second. 
They worked overtime to forge iron armor and ironware. 
At this moment, in the Lionheart Empire. 
In the imperial city, there was a lively commotion, with residents having put down their work, almost all joining the logistics efforts. 
Helping to pull iron, smelt iron, or turn in ironware and the like. 
Because of the nation’s effort, they managed to create one hundred thousand fully-armored soldiers in just a few months. 
And they had also captured thirty thousand carnivorous horses in large quantities. 
Imagine a strong steed, ridden by a fully-armored man wielding a giant axe charging at you. 
How could you dodge? 
Many people would probably wet their pants and surrender without a fight. 
“Today, the furnace fires have finally died down, and the trumpet of victory will sound. Our Lionheart Empire will rise from chaos and death, never to be defeated! 
The Great Tomb threatens our families, our friends, our future! 
And there are also those heinous goblins! 
We lions must protect our lionesses at home and exterminate them completely, leaving none alive!” 
In the plaza of the imperial city, Charles II passionately swore. 
Below him, a vast sea of one hundred thousand soldiers responded in unison, “Leave none alive!!!” 
These one hundred thousand soldiers were all well-equipped, clad in silver armor. 
In the sunlight, they reflected beams of dazzling white light. 
Like the glow of victory. 
Duke Klein was dressed in new gold and silver armor, his eyes flashing with hatred. 
He wished he could kill Lin Tian right now. 
Like a fierce beast ready to charge out of its cage at any moment. 
Additionally, the Imperial Knight Commander Hamlet and the group of imposing imperial knights behind him were also restless. 
They longed to slay the monsters with their own hands. 
This imperial knight regiment was personally selected and trained by Charles II. 
Their strength was formidable, having carried out many cross-border missions. 
Seeing the high morale, Charles II smiled with satisfaction and then stepped back. 
Next, the old but imposing Pope slowly stepped forward. 
As his holy scepter struck the ground, the lingering sound in the air instantly cleared. 
The world seemed to have pressed the mute button, becoming eerily quiet. 
Then he finally spoke, “Our enemy is not human, but monsters. Before, your fathers might have participated in such battles, creating decades of peace for you. 
But today, it is our turn to create a peaceful future for our descendants. Are you afraid of death?” 
The old Pope’s words were conveyed by the cardinal, as his voice was already failing. 
The crowd didn’t hesitate in their reply, “Not afraid!!” 
“May the Lord bless us…” The old Pope said, making the sign of the cross. 
Then he began to perform blessings for the entire army, his scepter emitting a brilliant light, “Luck Blessing, High-level Defense Blessing, High-level Strength Blessing, High-level Speed Blessing, High-level…” 
It wasn’t just him. 
All the monks were also beginning to bless the entire army. 
Beams of holy light shot into the sky! 
Transforming into starlight, falling among the soldiers. 
It was extremely awe-inspiring. 
The soldiers felt the changes in their bodies, becoming excited. 
Unfortunately, there were too many people, so each person received only a small boost, but it was better than nothing. 
“Your Majesty, are you sure you want to take all one hundred thousand elite soldiers? What about your citizens?” 
The old Pope turned, his golden eyes heavy as he looked at him. 
This could be considered the entire fighting force of the Lionheart Empire. 
The rest were old, weak, sick, and disabled soldiers without armor or decent weapons. 
If an enemy nation sent just ten or twenty thousand elite troops, they could sweep through easily. 
Charles II’s expression was solemn as he gazed into the distance, seeming to come to terms with it, “I won’t let everyone die for the sake of a crown. To eradicate the Great Tomb, we must use all our strength.” 
He had already informed the city’s residents and soldiers beforehand. 
If an enemy invaded, they should surrender directly. 
Just join them. 
Of course, this message was also relayed back by enemy scouts. 
Upon hearing this, the enemy king had no intention of invading and strictly ordered that no baron or lord was to make any move against the Lionheart Empire during this period. 
In the face of monsters, humanity was united. 
Otherwise, they would have long been ruled by monsters. 
“May the Lord be with you, Amen…” 
A glimmer of astonishment and admiration flashed in the old Pope’s eyes. 
After speaking, he stepped back. 
At this point, Charles II stood high, overlooking the one hundred thousand elite soldiers below, “Swish!” 
He suddenly drew his imperial sword, “Soldiers, march forward! Trample that evil, dark land to pieces. Leave no inch behind!!!” 
The mighty army turned around collectively! 
They began their advance! 
Their grand momentum seemed to condense into a mighty lion, ready to hunt its prey. 
The old Pope, accompanied by the Holy Mother, the cardinals, a hundred Holy Guards, ten Temple Guards, and over four thousand monks and nuns, also started forward after finishing the last verse of the Bible.
