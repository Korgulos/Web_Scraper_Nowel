Chapter 236: The Wrath of the Twelve-Winged Seraph! 
TL: Sungmin  
“Foul fallen one! I will be the one to judge you first!” 
Javier, looking at Alice’s resolute expression, raised the Holy Cross Sword, intending to execute her. 
There was no redemption for her, so this was the only way. 
Even though she was gravely injured, the powerful surge of divine energy erupted from Javier like a vast ocean, overwhelming and untouchable. 
Alice slowly closed her eyes, unexpectedly calm. 
After all, she had already died back in the royal city. 
“Keheheh… Angels are the filthiest creatures in the world! Their blood is enough to make anyone sick!” 
Suddenly. 
A sinister voice echoed from within the Ominous Blade! 
A burst of crimson aura exploded forth, forcibly suppressing Javier’s divine power! 
Combined with the effect of the Blood of Ruin. 
Javier finally fell to one knee, clutching the wound on her abdomen, her face filled with shock and panic. 
“Darkspawn…?! I-I can’t believe there are still Darkspawn in this world! No… I can’t fall here…”  
She attempted to flap her wings, trying to take flight and continue the fight. 
“Smack!” 
A heavy force suddenly hit her from behind, knocking her down. 
Lin Tian stomped firmly on Javier’s pure white wings, feathers flying everywhere, and coldly sneered, “Your feathers seem to be shedding quite a bit, angel.” 
Javier’s heart skipped a beat, terror rising as she tried to stand up. 
But the more she struggled, the harder Lin Tian pressed down with his foot, pinning her firmly to the ground. 
“Goblin! What are you doing?! Let me go! I’m an angel, a protector of the Holy Kingdom, a guardian of Eden!” 
Javier struggled to speak, trying to summon her divine power, but she could no longer muster any strength. 
Her energy had reached its limit. 
Any further, and death might come for her. 
Lin Tian chuckled darkly, “What am I doing? Oh, dear angel, I just love pure and holy things like you. Don’t you think I’m a good candidate for greatness?” 
“You… you shameless wretch!”  
A sudden realization struck Javier, and her body shuddered. 
Lin Tian laughed heartily, then turned his gaze toward Alice. “Princess Alice, you…” 
“There’s nothing more to say,” Alice interrupted calmly. “If being deemed ‘evil’ defines me, then I must say, evil isn’t so bad after all.” 
With that, she walked toward Gobu Yue and the others. 
Meanwhile, on the ground, Javier frantically cursed, “Let me go, wicked goblin! Justice will see you executed! Committing more sins will only make your death more painful!” 
“Painful? Hahaha, angel sister, do you see the smile on my face? Where’s the pain in that? Justice has you under my feet, and evil keeps me grinning from ear to ear~” Lin Tian taunted. 
He then slowly bent down, bringing his face close to Javier’s fair, fragrant cheek. 
Sticking out his crimson tongue, he tasted the angel’s skin for himself. 
The slimy sensation made Javier nearly break down, “Stop! Goblin! You can’t! You mustn’t do this anymore!” 
At that moment. 
Gobu Tian and the others sighed in relief and teased, “Hey, angel sister, I’ve got some bad news for you. The more you resist, the more excited we get~” 
Javier froze in disbelief. 
But if she didn’t resist, wouldn’t she be considered a fallen one? 
Better to die outright than lose the right to call herself an angel. 
Yet if she fought back, it would only encourage the goblins to continue. 
“What should I do? Oh Lord, guide me!”  
In her inner turmoil, Javier fearfully began to pray. 
… 
In Heaven, at the Sacred Square. 
Watching the scene unfold on the magic screen, every angel trembled with uncontrollable rage! 
“Goblins!!!” 
“How can this be? Those vile, wicked goblins dare to defile our angels?!” 
“I will personally see that sinful goblin judged! I will do it with my own hands!” 
“To touch the pure and sacred body of an angel… it’s absolutely unforgivable!” 
The most worried, however, was Loxie. 
Panicking, she pleaded, “This is terrible! There’s even a Darkspawn involved. Archangel, please, you have to do something to save Javier!” 
Yet Gabriel’s face was clouded with shadowy gloom, remaining silent. 
This situation had been beyond her predictions. 
But with her high status, she had learned to accept the harsh reality of defeat. 
Trying to console the others, she finally spoke, “Defeat is nothing uncommon in this brutal world. Javier sacrificed herself for justice. We will remember her forever…” 
… 
“Vile goblin! Didn’t I tell you to stop? Stop coming near my face!”  
Javier snarled with pure disgust, flapping her wings desperately, but to no avail. 
Instead, her sacred white feathers fluttered down, creating a striking image of holiness mingled with sin. 
A scene filled with stark contrast, almost painfully ironic. 
Lin Tian pressed down even harder on the weakening Javier, “Now, angel, it’s my turn to judge you…” 
“Riiiip!” 
The sound of fabric tearing suddenly filled the air! 
Harsh and Despairing! 
Javier felt the chilling breeze brush against her exposed skin, and her body seemed to turn to stone. 
Then, with a surge of pent-up fury, she screamed out in desperation, “Goblin, get away from me, leave me alone!” 
If she didn’t resist, she would disgrace the name of an angel. 
She used all her strength to clutch at the dirt in front of her, attempting to crawl forward. 
This scene made the watching angels clench their delicate fists in frustration, their hatred growing. 
“Don’t move, or your wounds will tear open. Let me help you settle down first~,” Lin Tian sneered as he looked at her sacred, untouchable figure, his heart pounding. 
For the first time, he felt what it truly meant to defile the divine! 
That sense of sinfulness surged through him like a flood, overwhelming his entire being! 
It was enough to make his mind lose focus! 
Javier, still trying to crawl forward, was suddenly struck by a searing pain, as if her body had torn apart! Her entire being went rigid, her pupils trembling violently! 
Her vision blurred, and in the next moment, she passed out. 
Witnessing this, Gobu Kuang couldn’t help but feel a bit envious. “The boss might be the first person on the continent to reduce an angel to a mere plaything!” 
“Damn, getting to witness this is more than enough!” 
Osius and Grugia had been staring unblinkingly for ten whole minutes, their eyes glued to the scene before them, afraid they’d miss anything. 
The other demi-human monsters trembled with excitement. 
“I’m so jealous! If I could just have an angel for myself… I’d die happy!!!” 
“Don’t be silly! Just seeing such a sacred scene already puts us ahead of 99% of the creatures on this continent!” 
“Your Majesty, will we get a turn afterward?!” the demi-human monsters asked excitedly. 
Sara, watching all this, could barely contain her excitement. “Even an angel has fallen to His Majesty… this will surely become a legend! My god! Such glory!” 
The mere thought of it was making her so excited she could barely keep herself together. 
Her obsessive pursuit of glory had turned her into Lin Tian’s most devoted admirer. 
At that moment. 
Lin Tian was completely lost in the angelic embrace of Javier, unable to extricate himself. 
He couldn’t hear what anyone else was saying. 
Gobu Kuang, standing nearby, remarked, “That probably won’t be possible. Angels are like divine beings, right? Our boss is going to devour her to complete his evolution.” 
“What?!”  
This statement shocked the demi-human monsters into silence. 
They dared not speak another word. 
Their gazes all turned toward the Zerg Queen in the distance, “She’ll do just fine!” 
The Zerg Queen, on the verge of fainting from shock, muttered to herself, “How can this be? Even a god… if only I had cooperated with the goblins earlier, I wouldn’t be in this position now!” 
Before she could finish speaking, the demi-human monsters rushed over, covering her mouth and swallowing her words amid the crowd. 
… 
Meanwhile, in the Holy Square of Heaven. 
Every angel’s heart bled. 
“Where is the Lord?! Quickly, open the gates of Heaven! I must personally execute that goblin!” 
“Goblin! I won’t let you escape!” 
“The year will pass quickly. Everyone, when the time comes, we will descend and judge all monsters!” 
“A great cleansing! Every evil, sinful, despicable creature must be judged!!!” 
The situation had driven the angels to the brink of madness. 
Loxie, staring at the screen, covered her mouth and began to cry, retreating several steps in horror. 
She couldn’t believe it—Javier had been defiled by a goblin! 
“How… how could this happen? Archangel, please, please save Javier!” Loxie pleaded through her tears. 
However, Gabriel, seated on the Sacred Throne, only paused momentarily. Her face was dark with hatred and fury, a terrifying anger that suffocated everyone around her. 
Sensing her state, the other angels fell silent. 
“We are merely the guardians of Eden. The Lord is distant, and only He can open the gates of Heaven. 
“Next year, we will descend together for a great cleansing! And I will personally bring that goblin to trial and execution!” 
As she spoke, Gabriel’s twelve massive wings unfolded with a sudden flourish! 
The entire sky was engulfed in crimson fury! 
Even the clouds turned blood-red! 
The rage even reached down into the mortal realm! 
Lin Tian, still reveling in the pleasure of his conquest, was abruptly pulled back by the sight of the sky turning crimson. He simply smiled, “The wrath of the Archangel? I may have suffered a bit this time, but next time, you won’t have it so easy…” 
With that, he lifted the snow-white, sacred form of Javier. 
“You…”  
Javier barely managed to utter a word, fully aware that her death was imminent. 
Lin Tian, still lost in the lingering pleasure of the moment, found it hard to regain his composure. 
He was reluctant to devour this angel so soon. 
Otherwise, it would be another year before he could experience such a thrill again. 
However, he feared that Javier might recover her strength. 
To be safe, he decided to devour her. 
But before that, he thought, there might be something better to fuse with than her spirit. 
The spirit of a god—though Javier was female, it wouldn’t affect its function. 
“Abnormal Fusion…” 
Lin Tian felt an overwhelming surge of power coursing through his body, filling every inch of him. 
Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind, “Even if it might not be useful, I should at least give it a try.” 
He hadn’t yet used Lucky Steal. 
Due to his recent, uh, overexertion, his memory had become foggy, and he had forgotten about the skill. (For the record, it’s the character’s memory that’s failing—not the author’s! Don’t you dare slander me!) 
“Congratulations to the host for acquiring the skill: Judgment Execution!” 
Hearing the system’s notification, Lin Tian was momentarily stunned. 
Could he actually steal skills? 
While goblins could devour abilities, this usually only applied to innate ones. Most powerful skills had to be learned through training. 
Looking at this world-class skill, how could he not be excited? 
Lin Tian was truly thankful for fusing with the spirit—his memory had improved, or else he might’ve missed out on this divine skill. 
This was his first-ever world-class ability. 
“Well then, goodbye, dear angel…” 
With that, he opened his gaping maw… 
“Hiss! Such a shame!”  
The crowd sighed in unison as they watched Javier get completely devoured, leaving nothing behind except a golden, bloodstained feather clinging to the corner of Lin Tian’s mouth. 
“Congratulations, host! Attributes increased: Health +2000, Strength +770, Defense +780! 
Evolution progress: 3/10!” 
Seeing how much his stats had increased in one go, Lin Tian smiled with satisfaction. 
His combat power had skyrocketed to 17,000! He could now easily obliterate an ordinary Demon King in an instant. 
And with just seven more demigods, he would be able to evolve again. 
What would happen after that was beyond imagination. 
He had thought this goal was far off, but now he realized that by next year, he could capture the angels and finish the task in one go. 
A year—it was neither too long nor too short. 
“Clear the battlefield and imprison the Zerg Queen. We’ll set up camp in the Zerg Empire for a while,” Lin Tian ordered. 
There were piles of corpses everywhere, a mountain of them, and each one was a treasure trove of experience. 
To not devour them would be an absolute waste. 
It was also the perfect opportunity for the Zerg Queen to birth a new brood of hybrid goblins, allowing them to feast on these experience packs. 
He would build a terrifyingly strong army. 
Though he intended to focus on developing the high-level combat forces, lacking soldiers for now made him feel a bit insecure. 
Without an army, they would always remain just a group, never truly an empire.
