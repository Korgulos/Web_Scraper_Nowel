Chapter 143: Then Let’s Get Married Today, Shall We? 
TL: Sungmin 
He had just given them a chance, saying that the beer had spilled. 
But Osius insisted on correcting it. 
There was no way around it now. 
They were heading straight for death, and no one could stop it. 
The entire hall was filled with the oppressive atmosphere of death brought by a top predator! 
Everyone felt like they couldn’t breathe! 
They were so angry they wanted to cry but had no tears, “Osius! You idiot, are you trying to get us killed?!” 
“Big Sis, is it too late for me to gouge out my own eyes? Spare me!” 
“I’ll gouge out my ears and eyes; we saw nothing, heard nothing!!!” 
Osius was already drenched in sweat, trembling. 
Suddenly, 
A naked man walked in through the door, crying out, “Bastards! You’ve gone too far this time. When someone gets drunk, they experience hell!!!” 
It was Grugia, who had been picked up by an old lady. 
Despite being a strong warrior with a combat power of over 9,000, 
And possessing Titan genes, 
He had lost his purity. 
Life was worse than death. 
Opening his eyes, he saw a toothless mouth, kissing all over him. 
It could be said it was the most terrifying hellish scene. 
Corpses strewn everywhere, rivers of blood, none of it compared to this. 
“Am I interrupting? Goodbye, you guys carry on…” 
Sensing the terrifying atmosphere and seeing the murderous look in the One-Eyed Owl’s eyes, Grugia suddenly didn’t feel scared anymore. 
What was in front of him was even more terrifying. 
He immediately retracted his previous words. 
Osius quickly went over and grabbed him, “My good brother, wait a moment before you leave!” 
“Let go! Who are you!?” Grugia cursed, trying to break free. 
Osius had a bitter expression, looking like he was risking everything, “Guys, let’s all go together. Big Sis can’t kill us all, right!?” 
But no one dared to take a step forward. 
At this moment. 
A clever person stepped out, kneeling on the ground, “I, Zesidor, swear to God, I will never speak a word of what I saw or heard. If I do, let God’s punishment strike me dead on the spot!” 
“Thud!” 
One after another, everyone knelt down and swore. 
Although Grugia was bewildered, he followed suit. 
They cherished their lives. 
On the side, Lin Tian, lying on the table, was truly drenched in sweat, “Damn, luckily I pretended to be asleep. Otherwise, I would have lost big time.” 
When he heard that idiot Osius say he wanted to remind the One-Eyed Owl about his pants. 
He had guessed it would turn out like this. 
“Hmph, get lost, all of you! If a single word gets out, I guarantee I’ll blow all your heads off!” The One-Eyed Owl cursed. 
It was a threat, not an exaggeration! 
And no one doubted the truth of those words. 
They all hurriedly fled. 
Then, the One-Eyed Owl turned and walked into the bathroom, and the sound of running water could be heard. 
She began to wash herself. 
Although this world didn’t have modern tap water and showers. 
They did have a faucet connected to underground water. 
So the One-Eyed Owl directly took a cold shower. 
Lin Tian was stunned, did she really not close the door while showering? Looking up, he could see those solid muscles, that sexy tall figure. 
Radiating a tempting aura in the clear cold water. 
But he didn’t dare to look much, quickly pretending to sleep again. 
After showering, the One-Eyed Owl took out a towel to dry her hair and kicked the table where Lin Tian was sleeping, “Oi, kid, still not awake? Do you take me for a fool?” 
“Huh? Big Sis? Good morning, what a refreshing sleep it was.” Lin Tian pretended. 
The One-Eyed Owl rummaged through the tables in the hall, looking for a slice of bread to eat. 
While eating, she threw a piece to him, “So, what do you want? I’ve already lost to you, but I’ve never felt so good as last night, haha!” 
Sometimes, winning too often becomes dull. 
Occasionally experiencing defeat can be even more exhilarating than victory. 
Because it meant finding a worthy opponent, gaining motivation. 
“Really? Then I want to marry you!” 
Lin Tian’s eyes lit up with excitement. It was really comfortable dealing with these people. 
Straightforward, without any hidden agendas. 
Maybe they were the normal ones, not the lunatics and madmen the outsiders spoke of. 
The One-Eyed Owl nodded, “Sure, how old are you? You look about 20. I’m 29, you don’t mind?” 
“There’s a saying that a woman older by three years is like holding a treasure, older by nine years, I get three treasures.” 
Lin Tian didn’t mind at all. 
Although she was 29, her face looked like she was 20, not immature, but full of youthful vitality. 
Probably related to the bloodline of gods. 
The One-Eyed Owl continued, “Alright, when shall we get married? How about we do it soon?” 
Her decisiveness made Lin Tian feel a bit embarrassed. 
At that moment, a voice rang out at the door, “Big Sis! Are you serious? Marrying this guy?!” 
Osius, Grugia, and the others who had initially left, all rushed back in. 
They were filled with disbelief. 
For them, most things didn’t matter much. 
But this, they had to take seriously. 
They were nearly fanatical followers of the One-Eyed Owl, worshiping her, taking her as their role model. 
Who would want to see their idol marry a weakling? 
The thought of their idol being with a weakling every night was more unbearable than death. 
So, they couldn’t stand it. 
Grugia understood the situation, “Kid, though I admire you for drinking down Big Sis, you can’t handle this! I’ll give you 10,000 gold coins, go home and marry ten wives instead!” 
He reached into his pocket as he spoke. 
In this world, 10,000 gold coins could get you a hundred wives. 
Especially since there was no monogamy system. 
“At worst, we’ll all help you with one task. Though our Dragon Slayer Guild has a bad reputation outside, we never break our word!” Osius also spoke firmly.
