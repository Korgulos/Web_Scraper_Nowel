Chapter 4: Establishing Authority 
TL: Sungmin 
“Hey, you, where’s the ironware? If there’s no ironware, we’ll eat you!” 
At this moment, the goblin with the stone spear, a minor leader, walked over and urged him. 
They hadn’t had enough to eat from the wild boar just now. 
He wanted to eat Lin Tian right now. 
His eyes were full of killing intent, and saliva dripped from his mouth. 
Gobu Yue quickly explained, “Wait a bit longer. Ironware isn’t that easy to make, but we’ll do our best.” 
“Hurry up, hurry up!” 
The stone spear goblin didn’t listen to him and pushed Gobu Yue to the ground, waving his stone spear and shouting. 
Lin Tian’s expression was cold as he sneered, “Here it is, the ironware is ready. Look at this.” 
Suddenly, a cold light flashed! 
He took out a short sword. 
Even though it was a short sword, it was about a meter long, very cumbersome to hold, and had to be dragged on the ground. 
“Hmm?” 
Hearing this, the surrounding goblins rushed over excitedly. 
Having a sword meant they could eat meat and capture higher-level creatures for mating! 
Especially the elves in the north; every day these goblins would sneak a peek at them. Just looking was enough, then… you know. 
The stone spear goblin was stunned for a moment, then became extremely excited! 
He quickly turned and shouted toward the gray-black shack, “Boss! Ironware! It’s ironware!” 
“Swish!” 
Suddenly! 
A cold light flashed, and the stone spear goblin’s voice abruptly stopped. 
His stone spear and body were neatly cut in half. 
Blood and organs spilled all over the ground! 
It was Lin Tian who had swung the iron sword with force, slicing him in two! He had long been annoyed with this guy. 
He was like his former boss at work, always making things difficult and rushing him for trivial matters. 
Looking at the corpse on the ground, he felt immensely satisfied! 
“He killed a goblin!” 
In an instant, the whole tribe was in an uproar! 
The goblins who had gathered picked up their weapons and were ready to resist, their expressions fierce, baring their teeth. 
If they all pounced on Lin Tian, not even a hair would be left of him. 
Gobu Yue was trembling with fear, “What should we do, Boss? I’m scared.” 
“Don’t worry, that old cunning creature won’t let anything happen to us.” 
Lin Tian stood confidently in place. 
Sure enough, the sound of a staff striking the ground came from behind. 
The goblin priest slowly walked out and used the ‘Call’ skill, making all the goblins quiet down. 
Then he said, “Kekeke, it really is ironware. Very good, I want more, and I want iron armor too.” 
“Okay, but I need people to help.” 
Lin Tian replied, the iron ore had to be found by others; he would stay in the tribe to be safe. 
The goblin priest pondered for a moment, then used the call skill again, making Lin Tian a minor leader. 
He could now manage thirty goblins. 
Though it was a small number, Lin Tian had to accept it; otherwise, that old cunning creature would definitely become suspicious. 
“Thank you, Boss.” 
Lin Tian deliberately flattered him, making the old creature think he was submitting to him. 
Then, the priest goblin returned to his shack, a place where no one was allowed to enter. Those who had entered before had all become natural fertilizer. 
“Boss, Boss, wait, it hurts so much…” 
On the ground, that minor leader was dragging his half body, struggling to crawl, hoping the goblin priest would save him. 
After all, being called a cockroach, his life force was indeed strong. 
Suddenly, he felt a strong force on his head, as Lin Tian stomped his head into the dirt. 
The other goblins were stunned, developing a sense of fear toward this newcomer. 
These low-level creatures respected power, and Lin Tian’s display of dominance made them fearful! 
But it wasn’t enough! 
Lin Tian coldly glanced at the goblin under his foot and tore off one of his arms to start chewing! 
The goblin, in fear and pain, gradually lost his breath. 
Faced with such a Lin Tian, the other goblins couldn’t hold it in any longer. They put away all their discontent and cowered, not daring to look directly at him. 
Even goblins wouldn’t eat their kind alive! 
Lin Tian let Gobu Yue eat his fill first, then kicked the rest away, “You can eat now.” 
Instantly, those goblins swarmed over and devoured everything clean! 
Usually, they were starving because they couldn’t catch any prey, always eyeing each other like pieces of fat meat. 
Finally getting something to eat, no one held back. 
“Boss, you’re amazing! You were so scary just now, my legs went weak.” 
Gobu Yue said admiringly beside him. 
Lin Tian smiled calmly, “Don’t worry, this is just the first day, and there will be plenty for you.” 
“‘Number Two, what should we do now?” 
At this moment, the other goblins asked, all looking blank, not knowing what to do. 
Upon hearing this, Lin Tian nearly fainted. “Just call me Brother Lin, don’t call me ‘Number Two.'” 
As he spoke, he punched the first goblin who called him ‘Number Two,’ to make an impression, like training a dog—you had to hit them. 
After a moment of contemplation, he knew goblins were nocturnal creatures, but they could also act during the day without any problem. 
He said, “Do you want ironware?” 
“Yes, Brother Lin!” 
Hearing the word ‘ironware,’ the goblins’ eyes lit up. 
“Do you want to mate with humans?!” 
“Yes! Yes! Yes!” 
“Do you want to eat meat until you’re full?” 
“Yes!” 
“Do you want to mate with elves?” 
“Definitely! Ah, elves!!!” 
With just a few words, the goblins were extremely excited. They would probably be willing to die for the ironware. 
They all raised their arms and shouted, “Long live Brother Lin.” 
At this moment, no one noticed the goblin priest in the shack staring at Lin Tian through the darkness, his expression complex. 
Seeing the mood was right, Lin Tian gave his orders, “All of you, go out and find all kinds of stones for me, as many as possible!” 
“Brother Lin, why do we need to find stones?” 
A goblin scratched his big head in confusion. 
One of the more noticeable ones jumped out, “It must be because Brother Lin likes eating walnuts and needs stones to crack them!” 
“Your head looks like a walnut. This is an important step in smelting iron, now hurry up and find them.” 
Lin Tian said impatiently. 
Explaining what kind of ore was iron ore would be too difficult for them to understand. 
He would have to wait until someone found a piece, then let them see it with their own eyes to tell the difference. 
After all, he didn’t have to look for it himself, so he could order them around as he pleased. 
What goblins lacked in everything, they made up for in numbers. 
But he hadn’t expected it to take a full two days before a goblin finally found a piece of iron ore. 
In the following days, all the goblins went out looking for ore, but even after searching the entire area, they didn’t find much. 
As expected, iron ore was a rare resource coveted by high-intelligence species. 
It seemed they would have to seize the elf tribe’s iron mine in the future. 
“Nearly ten days and we’ve only gathered this little, barely enough to make ten short swords.” 
Lin Tian said bitterly, looking at the seven or eight lumps of ore in front of him. 
But then he had a flash of inspiration. Since they couldn’t make many short swords, they could make spears! They could make at least fifty spearheads! 
The spear shafts could be replaced with sturdy wood. 
With fifty spears, they could easily capture the elf tribe’s iron mine and fully arm themselves. In a ten-kilometer radius, no creature would dare provoke this tribe! 
They spent another day building a clay furnace to facilitate iron smelting. 
Other goblins were tasked with breaking the ore into small pieces. 
“You lot, come over here and keep the fire burning well. If the fire dies down, I’ll throw you in!” 
Lin Tian ordered. The melting point of iron was over 1,500 degrees, so the fire had to be big and intense. 
The whole tribe was illuminated by the firelight all night long! 
While the iron was being smelted, Lin Tian trained two goblins in blacksmithing and making molds, as he couldn’t do it all by himself. 
Lin Tian asked Gobu Yue, “What kind of weapon do you like?” 
She was the first female goblin ever, and he needed to make not only a weapon for her but also a set of simple armor. 
Gobu Yue was at a loss, “I… I don’t know.” 
“You said you like the moon, so I’ll make a crescent moon blade for you.” 
Finally, everything was ready, and the life simulation’s cooldown had refreshed. 
Now was the time. 
Sitting there, Lin Tian’s gaze involuntarily turned to the central shack. 
That old creature would probably try to kill him once he finished forging these weapons. 
So, he had to be fully prepared. 
“System, start the life simulation.”
