Chapter 79: Declare War! Take Back Alicenia! 
TL: Sungmin  
… 
Lion King City. 
Also known as the imperial city. 
Those imperial scouts who had been investigating Clinforth fled back in a frenzy. 
The Sword Saintess had betrayed humanity, and Clinforth had completely fallen! 
The enemy hadn’t even attacked yet, and the internal collapse had already begun. 
Several scouts ran straight to the temple, shouting, “Your Majesty! It’s over! It’s all over!” 
Charles II furrowed his brow and reprimanded them, “Why are you panicking? Everyone, calm down.” 
“Is there any news of Alicenia?” 
Upon hearing this, the scouts looked at each other nervously, filled with fear. 
Finally, someone spoke, “Your Majesty, Alicenia… has betrayed us.” 
Charles II’s expression changed slightly, not yet grasping the severity of the situation. “Betrayed? How so?” 
The scouts, unwilling to believe it themselves, regretfully said, “Goblins invaded Clinforth. At the last moment of resistance by the white-hat mage Clin, the Sword Saintess shattered his Gate of Heaven and killed thousands of soldiers and civilians, including the white-hat mage Clin…” 
This information was overwhelming for Charles II, leaving him momentarily stunned on the throne. 
“Your Majesty? Are you alright?” one scout asked worriedly. 
After a long pause, Charles II questioned, “Are you sure there is no mistake? Alicenia, how could she join the goblins, let alone massacre soldiers and civilians!” 
Scouts, in essence, were reconnaissance soldiers and spies—the most crucial intelligence members of a nation. Each one’s professional standards were top-notch, making lying impossible. But now, Charles II preferred to doubt the scouts rather than believe such a thing. 
The scouts, not knowing how to prove it, replied, “Your Majesty, we… we wouldn’t deceive you.” 
Charles II’s expression began to turn frantic, unable to accept such news. To soothe his mind, he could only suspect the scouts. 
Just as he considered this, another group of people entered. 
Seeing that the newcomers were members of the Clin family who had escaped earlier, Charles II’s heart sank. 
His normally steady hands, resting on the throne, began to tremble slightly. 
“Your Majesty! Clinforth has fallen!” 
The Clin family members’ words echoed those of the scouts. 
Charles II’s face darkened, and he remained silent for a long time. 
Finally! 
He drew the imperial sword, angrily shouting, “If one word of what you said is false, I will surely have you executed! Speak! Is it true?” 
“It’s true, Your Majesty!” The crowd hurriedly nodded in fear. 
“Ahhh! Goblins! Do you want to destroy my Lionheart Empire? Dream on! I will make you pay for everything!” Charles II roared, completely losing his imperial aura. 
The blow was too much to bear. 
Losing Clinforth was one thing, but for the noble and pure Sword Saintess to slaughter a city for goblins, to turn her blade against the very people she once fought to protect, was absurd. 
The scouts were saddened. “Your Majesty, please don’t be like this. None of us could have imagined that a group of goblins could create such havoc.” 
Charles II panted in anger, his low voice echoing in the grand temple like a burning lion. 
He finally spoke, “Gather all the ministers here. I’m going to see the old Pope!” 
“What!” 
Hearing this, everyone realized the situation had escalated to the highest level. 
They all withdrew. 
Charles II straightened his clothes and went directly to the church. 
However, he was not qualified to meet the old Pope and could only ask the Holy Mother or a cardinal to convey his message. 
The Holy Mother was shocked, “No way, how could Alicenia… this is all our fault.” 
She could roughly guess the reason. 
The people’s persecution and the forced violence to kill that goblin infant had pushed Alicenia to the brink. 
But she didn’t expect her to decide so quickly, even turning her sword against the empire’s citizens. 
Charles II’s face was grim, unable to speak, filled with frustration. 
Seeing this, the Holy Mother said, “Given the situation, I will ask the Pope what he thinks.” 
“No, directly invite the Pope to our empire’s temple council,” Charles II corrected firmly. 
The Holy Mother was stunned, “Alright, I will notify him.” 
It seemed the Lionheart Empire was about to change drastically. 
… 
In the empire’s temple. 
Barons, lords, ministers, commanders, and generals—all gathered together. 
The atmosphere in the entire hall was incredibly oppressive. 
Charles II, wearing the Golden Lion Crown, leaned back in the highest seat, resting his hand on it. 
He exuded authority without anger. 
Everyone was waiting for one person to arrive. 
Finally, outside the main doors, an elderly man in a platinum robe and holy garments appeared slowly. 
He leaned on a staff made of golden crystal. 
Wearing a golden cross helmet, with a cross necklace on his chest. 
Half of his face was exposed outside the hat, showing some white beard, giving him a kind appearance. 
The Holy Mother and a cardinal lightly supported him. 
Despite being over 120 years old, his eyes shone with a fiery golden light! 
Holy majesty! 
“Your Holiness!” 
As he stepped into the temple, everyone bowed deeply. 
Even Charles II rose from the throne to greet this transcendent figure. 
Offering the highest respect! 
Additionally, another throne was placed beside him. 
Supported, the Pope slowly walked up and sat down, side by side with the empire’s emperor. 
The Holy Mother and the cardinal stood beside him. 
The ministers below wore solemn expressions, their eyes filled with gravity. 
It had been a long time since such a serious council had been convened. 
And even the old Pope was invited. 
It was unimaginable how important this must be. 
Finally, Charles II spoke, “Your Holiness, everyone, this council is of great importance. Many of you may not know yet that Clinforth has fallen.” 
“What!” 
“Impossible! Isn’t the lord of Clinforth a White Hat Magician?” 
“And it’s an entire family of magicians…” 
Everyone was shocked, murmuring among themselves. 
However, Charles II continued, “This, in my opinion, is not the most important issue.” 
The cardinal’s face changed slightly, “Your Majesty, isn’t this important?” 
He didn’t know what had happened. 
Others were equally incredulous—what could be more significant than the fall of a city? 
“The Sword Saintess, Alicenia, she betrayed humanity, joined the goblin tribe, and personally massacred Clinforth…” 
The weight of these words almost crushed everyone! 
For a moment. 
The hall was eerily silent! 
Everyone’s eyes widened in disbelief at these words. 
But it came from the mouth of the king! 
Duke Klein staggered, almost kneeling, “Your Majesty, are you certain? How is this possible! Alicenia is such a noble and pure person, she couldn’t have slaughtered a city!” 
“Klein, enough! Do you not even believe the words of His Majesty?” 
At this moment, the Empire’s Imperial Knight Commander ‘Hamlet’ sternly said. 
The others trembled; many of them admired, even revered the Sword Saintess. 
This news was like a thunderbolt! 
Many questioned it aloud. 
Charles II’s face darkened with regret, “If only I had been more resolute at the time, I shouldn’t have been such a merciful king! It led to this situation!” 
“Ahhh! That damned goblin!!!!” 
Klein, with tears streaming down his face, grabbed his hair and knelt on the ground, crying! 
His goddess, idol, role model, and beloved had been taken away by a goblin. 
It hurt more than death. 
Likewise, several young people were crying uncontrollably, angry to the point of fainting! 
A few imperial soldiers came in and took them away, their emotions out of control. 
Charles II did not blame them and understood very well. 
Alicenia was too important to this country, to the people, to them all. 
The oppressive atmosphere was suffocating. No one expected Alicenia’s situation to end this way. 
Painful and heart-wrenching. 
The cardinal’s expression was full of guilt, “Your Majesty, please punish me. This is all my fault.” 
If he hadn’t tried to kill that goblin infant. 
These things wouldn’t have happened. 
Charles II’s face was grim, his displeasure evident, “Forget it, it’s not your fault, no need to blame yourself.” 
“Everyone! Today, for our Lionheart Empire, is the most painful day! It’s the most profound lesson in history! 
We must remember it deeply, engraved in our bones and never forget! 
The reason for gathering everyone here is only one: to declare all-out war on the goblin tribe! To reclaim Alicenia! To rebuild Clinforth!” 
Charles II’s voice suddenly became high-pitched and solemn as he stood up from the throne, raising his hand and shouting. 
Everyone immediately responded, “Declare war on the goblins! Reclaim Alicenia! Rebuild Clinforth!!” 
At this moment. 
A deep, elderly voice rang out, and everyone felt a sense of calm. 
The Pope spoke, “I understand now. The reason Your Majesty called me here is for this. You are determined, even if it means declaring war on the Great Tomb.” 
“I am old, but I must secure a peaceful and stable country for my people before I die! The Great Tomb remains a threat that cannot be ignored!” Charles II said firmly. 
No one disagreed, but their hands trembled slightly. 
The horrors within were beyond comparison to the goblins. 
Everyone had to prepare for death. 
They were facing ultimate darkness and ultimate evil. 
The old Pope remained silent, seemingly deep in thought, finally making up his mind, “Notify all church members across the continent to return.” 
“Understood!!” 
Hearing this, everyone was filled with hope! 
The Pope’s words meant he would mobilize the full power of the church to assist! 
“God bless, victory will belong to the Lionheart Empire once again!!!”
