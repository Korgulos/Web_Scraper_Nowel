Chapter 166: Great Empire Visit, Cooperation or Declaration of War? 
TL: Sungmin 
Seeing the demi-humans so full of energy, 
Lin Tian was able to relax. 
It was time to take a break. 
In the blink of an eye, half a month had passed. 
During this time, the Goblin Empire gradually accepted dozens of demi-human tribes! 
More than a hundred came seeking asylum. 
Furthermore, many demi-humans and high-intelligence monsters specifically migrated to the Enchanted Forest from distant lands. 
They didn’t want to join the Goblin Empire but understood the benefits of seeking shelter under a great tree. 
The main reason was that Lin Tian had opened up a trade market for monster races. 
As long as they were demi-humans or high-intelligence monsters, 
They could enter the Goblin Empire to trade, though they were forbidden from disrupting the lives of the humans within the empire. Violators would be killed. 
Suddenly, 
The capital saw a daily traffic of over a million! Countless monsters engaged in entertainment, trade, and life here. 
Even the surrounding towns were bustling. 
The earliest demi-humans had adapted with Fiona’s help and began developing their businesses. 
The Snake People specialized in concocting potions for sale, though they handed over the most precious ones to Lin Tian. 
The Catgirls, as expected, opened a cat cafe. 
The Rabbitfolk’s tavern business was incredibly booming; they had already opened seven branches and still couldn’t keep up. 
Lin Tian was somewhat at a loss as he watched the Goblin Empire transform drastically. 
Alice hurried into the royal hall, “Messenger, the city can no longer accommodate so many people. Should we consider expanding?” 
“That’s not a problem. Arrange for Gobu Kuang and the others to lead more goblins to work on expansion.” 
Lin Tian replied, while he pondered the issue of taxation. 
Because the daily revenue was just too enormous! 
The Succubi’s pleasure house alone generated a daily income of ten thousand gold coins! Many demi-humans traveled long distances just to visit. 
Since Lin Tian imposed a tax, the Succubi used their charms to drain their clients’ wallets. 
Though it was steep, those who had visited couldn’t seem to stay away, as if they were addicted, feeling restless if they didn’t go even for a day. 
Moreover, the Rabbitfolk’s tavern, 
Generated a daily income of two thousand gold coins! 
The cat cafe, potion shops, individual stalls selling rare minerals, materials, or game. 
All combined, the daily economic flow exceeded thirty thousand gold coins. 
Although it was still not comparable to those great empires, 
This was just the beginning. 
“Forget it, 70% tax is too high. Let’s make it 50%.” 
Lin Tian thought it over and finally decided. 
This tax rate was still considerably higher than the 30% imposed by those great empires, but he believed no one would refuse. 
He then prepared to convene a meeting. 
Every demi-human or high-intelligence monster tribe was to send a representative to the kingdom’s square. 
Notices were also posted at the city gates. 
In an instant, 
The entire square became lively. 
Over a hundred types of demi-humans and monsters gathered. 
“Yo! Goblin Majesty, didn’t you promise to visit before? Why haven’t you come?” 
The Succubus from before flew around Lin Tian. 
Catgirl Sophia added, “Your Majesty, I’m the owner and don’t rent out my body, but I’ve been waiting for you to pet me, meow!” 
Other representatives also flattered Lin Tian. 
Lin Tian cleared his throat; responding to each one would waste too much time. 
He directly said, “This time, I mainly want to announce the taxation issue. You all must have made quite a bit of money recently, right?” 
Upon hearing this, 
Everyone quieted down, not daring to meet Lin Tian’s gaze. 
When money was mentioned, they all became strangers. 
Even demi-humans and monsters used gold coins as currency in the demi-human kingdoms. 
The Goblin Empire was the first of its kind, but that didn’t mean other demi-humans and monsters hadn’t established kingdoms. 
For instance, the Ant Tribe Empire was one of the top monster kingdoms. 
Its national strength even far surpassed that of the War Empire. 
Gold coins could be used there. 
Additionally, many humans secretly traded with demi-humans and monsters. 
So they came not only for asylum but also to make a living. 
“That’s right, that’s right, we made over thirty thousand gold coins! Let’s give it all to Your Majesty!” 
The Succubus said with a cheerful smile. 
Money was useless to the Succubi; they only craved glamor. 
Catgirl Sophia wasn’t as generous, “Taxation is normal. Your Majesty, just tell us how much, and we’ll pay it.” 
Other demi-humans and monsters echoed this sentiment. 
Though they weren’t happy about it, they didn’t dare neglect Lin Tian. 
At least here, they could survive. 
In just over a year, the goblins had risen and destroyed three empires. 
The future was indeed promising. 
Only then did Lin Tian announce, “Alright, starting today, you won’t need to back-pay for the past half month. Afterward, you must pay 70% in taxes every month!” 
For humans, handing over food was more than enough. 
The land they cultivated was expanding, and many families were even raising goblins as their own children. 
This was because goblins were very hardworking. 
As for gold coins and wealth, it was up to the demi-humans and monsters to contribute. 
Given the goblins’ nature, they would certainly demand full payment from them. 
However, that would be impossible; if everything were handed over, the empire’s economy would stagnate, leaving no one to consume or do business. 
Income would drop to zero. 
So, to increase the empire’s treasury and purchase unique goods from other empires, this method was necessary. 
For example, the War Empire sold Titan genes externally, charging five hundred thousand gold coins each time. 
However, the purity was only 50%. 
Then there was the Giant Elephant Empire, which had a unique magic that could animate statues and inanimate objects. 
This was called ‘Magic Puppet.’ 
The larger ones could crush armies in battle; the most expensive Magic Puppet was said to sell for over a billion gold coins. 
It was unimaginable. 
Moreover, with money, they could purchase upgrade items like Snow Crystals from other empires. 
Therefore, money was extremely important. 
But upon hearing this, the demi-humans and monsters couldn’t sit still. 
“70%! That’s way too much!” 
“No country taxes this much, and Your Majesty, raising goblins doesn’t even require financial support!” 
“We already produce hybrid goblins for you, and now we have to pay such a high tax, it’s just too much…” 
All of them were crestfallen, their faces filled with worry. 
Seventy percent was indeed ruthless. 
Seeing them all pleading, Lin Tian finally said, “Since you’re refugees and life isn’t easy, let’s change it to 50%. If anyone has an objection, feel free to leave.” 
“No problem, meow! Your Majesty really is kind, meow!” 
Sophia’s previously dim eyes were now filled with light once more! 
She was overjoyed. 
The other demi-humans had expressions of relief, as if they had narrowly escaped disaster. 
They were very happy. 
Lin Tian had always intended to set the tax at 50%, but he feared they might haggle, so he initially proposed 70%. 
This bargaining tactic turned out to be far more effective than expected. 
It even made these folks revere him even more. 
The image of goblins as evil, cruel creatures loathed by everyone was beginning to change. 
However, this change was only among his own people. 
Lin Tian then dismissed them. 
As for the Succubus pleasure house, he wouldn’t visit such a place. If he were to be charmed with ill intent, it would be too late for regrets. 
There were many stories in history of kings being controlled by Succubi. 
The cat cafe and such could wait for later. 
“Ugh, I’m exhausted. There’s more work than I imagined.” 
Returning to the royal throne, Lin Tian let out a long sigh. 
Establishing an empire 
Was indeed not as comfortable as living in a tribe, where he could kill, burn, and plunder whenever he wanted. 
But now, these things could be accomplished with just a word. 
However, 
Once the empire’s strength was sufficient, he could launch wars. 
In the dimly lit throne room, 
Lin Tian’s face was full of an evil smile. 
He already started to miss the feeling of slaughter, the sound of enemies wailing and crying. 
Next time, 
It wouldn’t be like the Laiyang Plains, where he had to gamble without certainty, resulting in a situation where he couldn’t defeat anyone. 
He had to endure. 
Next time, he would conquer lands with the absolute power of a strong ruler. 
Thinking this, 
He picked up an ancient book beside him, a human-written work about goblins. 
He hoped to find a way to evolve. 
But at this moment, 
The Goblin Slayer and Lia quietly entered. 
Seeing the expressions on their faces, Lin Tian knew a fierce battle was coming. 
Goblin Slayer coquettishly said, “Little Tian, Little Tian-Tian? Did you miss me? I’ve missed you for so long. This time, I’ll definitely teach you a lesson!” 
“Sorry, Boss, I won’t be holding back either!” Lia added. 
Lin Tian shrugged and set the book down, “Hmph, taking care of the two of you is easy!” 
Just as they were about to get started, 
Alice pushed the door open and entered, looking at the three of them in the cold and dark throne room, sensing the atmosphere was off. 
A cold glint flashed in her eyes, “Messenger, what are you all doing here?” 
“Nothing, is there something you need?” Lin Tian asked, puzzled. 
Alice pushed the matter aside and insisted, “I don’t have any pressing issues. How about we talk about what’s going on with you first?” 
Lia, helpless, sighed, “Then, Princess Alice, do you want to…” 
“Yes…” 
Before she could finish, Alice blushed, biting her lip as she spoke. 
She already understood what was going on. 
Goblin Slayer shrugged, “You always keep such a stern face, Princess Alice. Why are you so shy at a time like this?” 
“I…” 
Alice hesitated, unsure of what to say. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but feel amused, but at least it seemed that Alice had already been won over by him. 
In private, she was entirely different from her usual self. 
After the situation settled down, 
Alice suddenly remembered, “Messenger, there are several envoys from other empires who have come and wish to cooperate with us.” 
“Cooperate? Are they humans or monsters?” 
Lin Tian asked with mild surprise. 
Alice explained, “They’re all from human empires. And as far as I know, two of them are from great empires, not any weaker than the War Empire.” 
Since they had come, 
Lin Tian was also curious to see what they were up to. 
Humans, actively seeking to cooperate with goblins, 
It was practically unheard of. 
It was the perfect opportunity to inquire more about the War Empire in detail. 
The sooner he could start a war, the sooner he could reunite with the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
If that group could be fully integrated into the empire, 
The strength would increase significantly. 
With that in mind, he hurried towards the empire’s external council hall, where Alice had already taken the envoys.
