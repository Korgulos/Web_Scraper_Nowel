Chapter 14: Sneak Attack Successful! 
TL: Sungmin 
The dragons in the sky were indeed imposing, terrifying the hundreds of goblins behind them into trembling.

Even a random dragon had such absurdly high attributes! 
And they could fly! 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but be surprised. Bright Town had provoked an entire dragon nest, probably around fifty or sixty dragons. 
It was definitely going to be destroyed. 
However, with that figure, that powerful figure present, it was hard to say!

Damn it! 
Seeing this familiar figure, Lin Tian couldn’t help but shout out! 
Damn it, it was too monstrous! 
He had thought there was only a slight gap, but it turned out to be a terrifyingly huge difference! 
Currently, his overall strength was only 750, which left him with no ability to resist! At most, he could handle an ordinary wyvern. 
The key was that her titles and skills were so many that the system couldn’t even list them all. 
Moreover, many of them included the word “Holy,” giving her a holy bonus specifically against monsters, adding an extra 10% damage. 
Fighting her, even if he had a group of big goblins behind him, would be hopeless. 
However, Lin Tian’s target this time was not her, but Loder and his people. 
As long as he could complete his revenge first. 
“Boss, w-what is that?! How can it be so powerful?!” A goblin stammered. 
They saw the Sword Saintess weaving through the air, not flying, but stepping on those wyverns. 
Every now and then, a sword slash would decapitate a dragon! 
In the midst of her jumps, she had already slain dozens of wyverns! 
It was unbelievably overwhelming! 
Moreover, her target wasn’t ordinary wyverns but the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother about a thousand meters high! 
Using this momentum, she leaped onto the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother! 
She immediately slashed through its giant wings, causing the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother to plummet into the distance! 
“Boom!” 
Such a terrifying fall kicked up a storm of yellow sand, almost swallowing Bright Town. 
Meanwhile, Loder and his group had only managed to kill ten dragons in total, but at least they had almost wiped out half. 
The remaining wyverns frantically spewed dragon flames, destroying the town. 
They also set their sights on Loder and his people. 
With claws extended, they pounced! 
“Ifreya, prepare!” Loder called out with a serious expression. 
The white-robed nun immediately activated her skill, Holy Sound, chanting the Bible. 
Within a certain range, teammates received an attack boost. 
“Mid-tier Sword Skill! Sky Slash!” 
“Whoosh!” 
Loder’s longsword charged for about ten seconds, releasing a stunning sword energy! 
It was about three meters long! 
It slashed open the attacking wyvern’s abdomen, spilling its guts all over the ground, and it fell. 
“Hahaha! I’m a dragon slayer too now!” 
Afterward, Loder was extremely excited, wiping the cold sweat from his forehead. 
From afar, Lin Tian kept his gaze on him, astonished that this guy could also kill a dragon with one move. It was unbelievable. 
[Loder: Lv41<br/>

Overall, this guy’s strength was higher than Lin Tian’s. 
But he didn’t intend to confront him head-on; instead, he aimed to strike when he was vulnerable. 
That’s how a goblin should be, a bit treacherous. 
The battle in Bright Town gradually reached its climax. 
The town had completely turned into a sea of flames, and the buildings were almost entirely destroyed. 
Many people had died in the battle. 
Only about a dozen wyverns remained. 
“Follow me!” 
Finally, Lin Tian decided to move, leading the goblins into the town’s drainage system, crawling bit by bit inside. 
Because they all had a stealth buff cast by the elves, they were less likely to be discovered. 
Eventually, they reached the central area of the town. 
Based on his memory, Lin Tian found the location of the underground shelter. 
Lin Tian instructed, “You go down and cause a commotion. The rest of the goblins hide and wait for my command!” 
From a distance, Loder and his group were already covered in wounds. 
Their health was less than half, very weak. 
The white-robed nun was also exhausted, unable to continue. 
The red-haired knight and others were in similar states. 
Their overall strength had significantly diminished. 
Lin Tian had been waiting for this moment; he just needed to lure them over. 
“Goblins! Why are there goblins here!” 
“No! My child!” 
“Help! Call the adventurers to save us!” 
Inside the underground shelter, the terrified voices of the residents echoed. 
A man frantically rushed up, shouting, “Ah! Goblin invasion! Where are the adventurers! Goblins are attacking the shelter!” 
“What?” Loder and the others nearby frowned, “Damn it, where’s my master?” 
Turning to look, the distant ground was covered in dust! 
They could hear dragon roars and sword clashes, indicating the battle was still ongoing. The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother was not easy to deal with. 
“You two hold on, there aren’t many dragons left. Ifreya, come with me, let’s kill those damned goblins!” Loder said angrily, rushing over in a hurry. 
Twenty meters. 
Ten meters. 
Getting closer and closer! 
Suddenly, a short sword stabbed out from the ashes, piercing Loder’s foot! 
“Ah! It hurts!” 
Loder screamed, thinking he had stepped on something sharp, only to realize it was a goblin! 
He quickly moved to kill it. 
At this moment, the hidden goblins pounced on him! 
Initially, he could resist, killing a dozen goblins. 
But the sheer number overwhelmed him, all aiming to seize his sword! 
In the end, he had to admit defeat. 
“Captain, help me! I’ve been captured by goblins!” 
Ifreya’s panicked voice rang out, as she was ensnared in a net, being dragged along the ground. 
Like dragging a dog. 
It was very humiliating. 
Loder’s heart tightened, “Damn it! Damn it! Why are there so many goblins here!” 
However, he was already very weak, and without his weapon, he couldn’t resist. 
Health was linked to stamina and energy. 
With low health, his stamina also dropped, leaving him with no strength to fight back. 
“Damn it, Captain! Ifreya!” 
The red-haired knight and the silver shieldbearer saw the situation from a distance and, ignoring the wyverns, rushed over to help. 
But as they passed a pile of collapsed buildings, a chill ran down their spines!
