Chapter 212: The Terror that Surpasses a Demon King! 
TL: Sungmin  
“Why are you asking me to die? I just saved you from the ruins!”  
Joan of Arc angrily questioned the young girl. She reached out, gripping her shoulders, shaking her.  
In an instant, the little girl burst into tears, crying out in pain, “Don’t kill me! Don’t kill me…”  
“Look at this false god, she’s losing her temper!”  
“Stop it! Are you going to hurt even a child now?”  
“Everyone, let’s take her down together! We must defeat this false god!” 
Seeing this, the starving masses, bloodlust in their eyes, rushed forward. Whether driven by a sense of justice or the evil within their hearts, it was hard to tell. 
They swarmed Joan of Arc, attacking her wildly.  
Her former allies and friends? They hit even harder than the rest!  
By now, Joan of Arc was so weak from hunger that she couldn’t even catch her breath, much less fight back.  
Within moments, she collapsed, unable to move. 
Lin Tian stood by, watching with a playful expression on his face. “Hypocritical people fighting a hypocritical god, how amusing.”  
“Your Goblin Majesty! We offer Joan of Arc to you! Please, just give us some food in return!”  
The soldier captain stepped forward, kneeling as he spoke. 
Several starving civilians dragged Joan of Arc out, placing her before him.  
Then, the entire city began to kneel, pleading desperately.  
The scene was filled with irony! 
The demi-humans around couldn’t believe their eyes. “The Goblin King really, really defeated Joan of Arc!?” 
“Incredible! His methods are terrifying!”  
“If something like this happened to me, I’d rather die. Such cruelty, to make someone wish for death!”  
“These methods are so satisfying! That Joan of Arc, always waving her so-called ‘justice’ around, how many of us demi-humans and monsters did she kill? What His Majesty did is such sweet revenge! Hahaha!” 
And it wasn’t just them. 
The One-Eyed Owl and the others drew in sharp breaths. “How is this possible… That guy is far more terrifying than I ever imagined!”  
They had always thought Lin Tian just had a bit of strength. 
But now? 
He was a being far more terrifying than even a demon king!  
A demigod, played with like this, reduced to something less than a dog!  
Unbelievable! 
“Your Goblin Majesty, your strength and wisdom have completely won me over. Such glory, even the greatest figures of our empire could not achieve in a hundred years!” 
Sara stood beside him, her eyes filled with admiration, reverence written all over her face. 
Toying with a demigod, without losing a single soldier!  
It was far more impressive than defeating one through brute force, and the glory was incomparable!  
She was deeply envious. If only it were her who had defeated Joan of Arc in such a way. 
At this moment. 
Lin Tian slowly dismounted from Little Black, like a demon king walking toward the Free Empire. 
“This…” 
The soldier captain and the starving masses, their hearts pounded wildly, overwhelmed by the pressure of his presence.  
They tried to suppress their fear, pressing their faces into the dirt, hoping that not seeing him would make them less afraid.  
But Lin Tian paid them no attention. His gaze was fixed on the slender, disheveled Joan of Arc. 
“Are you happy now?” Joan of Arc spat bitterly, trembling with fear as she slowly backed away. “Why… why would a goblin like you win? Why should I lose? Am I not supposed to represent justice? Why… just why…?” 
Lin Tian sneered, “Why? Who told you that justice always wins? If you’re so fond of extreme personal heroism, you’re better off reading a novel. Not here!” 
He then reached out his foot, stepping firmly onto her soft back, preventing her from escaping. 
The sensation made Joan of Arc shudder as if struck by lightning. Fear consumed her heart. 
She reached out toward the townsfolk she had once saved. “Everyone, please, save me! Please save me! I don’t want to fall into the hands of a goblin! I don’t want to die! Please, I’m begging you!”  
“Your… Your Highness…”  
The soldier captain and the others hesitated, exchanging glances.  
Seeing Joan of Arc’s tear-filled eyes and pleading expression, they ultimately chose to ignore her, stepping back a few paces. 
This action. 
It was the final straw that broke the camel’s back! 
Unwillingness, hatred, and despair surged through Joan of Arc’s entire being! 
Tears streamed down her face as she screamed with all her remaining strength, “You evil creatures! I will never forgive you!!!” 
“Buzz!!” 
A violent surge of divine power erupted from her. 
It shot toward the sky! 
The clouds, thick with gloom, scattered as sunlight poured down. The light of hope was ignited at this moment! 
A magic array of the Divine Domain spread its glow across the land! 
The pressure surged! 
The One-Eyed Owl and her comrades’ expressions changed. “Damn, has she awakened?” 
“This… Lady Joan of Arc! We…”  
The soldier captain and the others were equally stunned, unsure of which side to choose. 
What if Joan of Arc awakened and grew stronger, defeating the goblin? Then, they would all be killed. 
However, suddenly. 
Lin Tian pressed her down to the ground, unleashing his Hero’s Power! 
A sinister black goblin demon formed in the air, crashing into the Divine Domain. 
Hero’s Power was unaffected by a demigod’s domain. 
Of course, it had no effect on true gods. 
“Crack!” 
The sound of the Divine Domain shattering could be heard. 
Because Joan of Arc was weak at the moment, she couldn’t withstand Lin Tian’s Hero’s Power at all. 
On the ground, Joan’s eyes were still filled with divine light, but Lin Tian suddenly grabbed her by the neck, pinning her down tightly. 
The Divine Domain disappeared, and slowly, she began to recover. 
Unwillingly, she shouted, “You! How is this possible! You’re just a goblin, how do you have Hero’s Power?!” 
Suddenly, she realized something—it was the goblin’s Gene Devour. 
Hero’s Power was precisely a talent from the Trojans. 
“Why! Why am I failing? You evil beings, I curse you all!!!” 
Joan could no longer hold back her pain, tears streaming down her face as she glared hatefully at the starving townspeople. 
However, 
Crying was useless. 
Lin Tian showed no mercy. He extended his sharp claws, lightly swiping them like scissors! 
The sound of fabric tearing echoed! 
Joan of Arc tried to resist, but with Lin Tian’s grip tight around her throat, she was on the verge of suffocation. Her eyes and mouth leaked a flood of saliva. 
In the end, Lin Tian pressed her head into the dirt, her nose and mouth filled with soil, treated like livestock. 
She couldn’t even scream anymore. 
The shame and the tearing pain from behind drove her to the brink of madness! 
Her flawless body— 
Lin Tian naturally wouldn’t let it go, and in front of everyone, he declared that even a demigod was only worthy of being trampled beneath a goblin’s feet! 
Hearing Joan of Arc’s rhythmic screams of agony— 
The demi-humans and monsters behind him were filled with excitement, cheering, “Long live the Goblin King!!!” 
“Even a god is just a toy for the goblins, hahaha!” 
“To think that His Majesty’s promise would come true so soon, it’s too ruthless!” 
“I’m so envious! Such a beautiful human woman, and a demigod at that! I’m dying of jealousy!” 
“This is the strongest monster I’ve ever seen! A demon king? Hah, what a joke! Can a demon king crush a demigod beneath his feet and rule over her? Absolutely not!” 
As the monsters’ cheers echoed. 
And Joan’s cries of despair filled the air, the starving townspeople remained unmoved. Their minds were consumed by a single thought—food. 
After a long while. 
Joan of Arc had passed out completely, her life and death uncertain. 
Seeing Lin Tian stop, the soldier captain quickly asked, “Your Goblin Majesty, can… can we have some food now?” 
“You want food? Very well. Go wait in the city, and it will be distributed shortly.” Lin Tian replied. 
Upon hearing this, the soldier captain was overjoyed, ecstatic with gratitude! 
“Let’s go, let’s go! His Majesty Goblin is going to give us food! Hahaha!” 
Everyone returned to the city, filled with hope and joy as they waited. 
Lin Tian turned his gaze upwards and asked, “Little Black, what do you think—should these people live or die?” 
“Father, I don’t think they’re even human anymore. They’re worse than monsters. They disgust me.” 
Little Black, now in her dragon form, spoke in a voice rough and thunderous, filled with fury. 
She found their true nature revolting. 
Even the One-Eyed Owl and the others agreed. “Just wipe out those people already, kid. I actually feel sorry for that woman!” 
Of course, it wasn’t Joan of Arc’s suffering they pitied. 
It was the actions of those starving townspeople, worse than goblins. 
In this world, that was just how it was. The victors were kings, and the losers? Not even bandits, but merely objects to be used as one pleased. 
Alice was well aware of this fact. She even felt a sense of kinship with Joan of Arc. 
But she was fortunate enough to have divine guidance, avoiding the same fate. 
In the end, the very thing Joan had sworn to protect became the blade that killed her. 
And so. 
Lin Tian chuckled softly, “Alright then, Joan of Arc, before your death, I’ve avenged you. Little Black, burn them all to the ground.” 
“Whoosh!” 
With a single beat of her dragon wings, Little Black surged toward the city. 
The flames of annihilation ignited the entire city in an instant! It was like a sea of black fire—an overwhelming and shocking sight! 
“Your Goblin Majesty, why?! Didn’t we do as you asked!?” 
“Save me! What kind of fire is this? It can’t be put out!” 
“Ahhh!!!” 
As their pitiful cries echoed. 
Joan of Arc, in her hazy consciousness, began to laugh foolishly. Her laughter was filled with relief, as though a massive weight had been lifted from her shoulders. 
“Crack!” 
Suddenly. 
A crisp sound rang out. 
Lin Tian began devouring Joan of Arc—it was necessary for his evolution. 
And it was also his revenge. 
Not only had she meddled in his affairs, but she had also disrupted his empire, crippled the goblins, and destroyed the war empire he had painstakingly built. 
Before long, he had devoured everything. 
‘Evolution Progress (2/10)’ 
He still needed eight more. Lin Tian wasn’t sure whether to feel pleased or troubled as he looked out over the vast wilderness. 
There were no more demigods left. 
Lin Tian could only set his sights on the demigod empires outside the Uninhabted Zone. 
Though those monstrous beings were feared and avoided by all, Lin Tian didn’t care about any of that when it came to his evolution. 
This scene. 
It left a profound impact on the demi-humans and monsters. 
Only two words remained in their minds. 
Terrifying! 
This goblin was an existence even more terrifying than a demon king. 
He was utterly unpredictable. If they followed his orders, they could avoid a gruesome fate like the starving townspeople. 
If they disobeyed, Joan of Arc was a living, bloody example. 
So, they had no choice but to dutifully do what was expected of them, without daring to harbor any rebellious thoughts.
