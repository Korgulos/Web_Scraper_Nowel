Chapter 69: Isn’t That My Uncle? 
TL: Sungmin  
This was the lair of the Golden Iguana tribe. 
The home of the southern enchanted forest lord. 
At this moment, a small golden iguana was chasing a dragonfly, venturing far from home into the reeds. 
Its innocent, big eyes carefully searched every place. 
Its tongue flicked out occasionally to catch scents. 
However, after flicking its tongue, it had a strange expression, “Huh? There’s a weird smell around here…” 
As it was still curious, a pair of black hands stretched out from the mossy mud beneath it. 
Pulled it straight down! 
When Gobu Tian slowly crawled out of the swampy mud pit, he was holding a dead golden iguana. 
He looked at the two people and said, “Come and try this. It seems like a juvenile, but it’s already over a meter long.” 
Gobu Kuang tore off an iguana leg, crunching it in his mouth. The meat was very tender and fresh! 
Slightly fishy, with a faint sweetness. 
“This taste is amazing, no worse than human meat!” 
Gobu Shan’s eyes lit up after tasting it. 
After all, it was a subhuman species, so the taste was similar. 
The three exchanged glances and seemed to reach a consensus. 
“Child? Child, where have you gone?” 
In the iguana tribe, a mother iguana called out anxiously. It was mealtime, but her gluttonous child hadn’t returned. 
A iguana head peeked out from a nearby grass hut, teasing, “That unlucky kid of yours is always running around. Could it have been caught by monsters outside?” 
“My husband is the lord. What monster would dare catch my child? It must be tired of living.” The mother iguana retorted angrily. 
At that moment, Gobu Shan’s voice rang out, “Are you looking for him?” 
He tossed a shiny iguana head at the mother’s feet. 
The mother iguana was stunned, crying out, “Who are you? Don’t you know this is the lord’s tribe? How dare you, how dare you!!” 
“The lord? What’s that? But madam, you do look beautiful.” 
Gobu Kuang’s cunning voice echoed as he flipped over the hut and emerged, his eyes full of desire as he looked at her. 
The iguana man in the hut immediately rushed out with a weapon, “How dare you disrespect the lord’s wife! I’ll…” 
Unfortunately, he didn’t finish his sentence as a long bone spike pierced his heart. 
Gobu Shan immediately started roasting him on a nearby bonfire. 
In a few bites, he devoured him completely. 
The average strength of these iguanas was around two thousand. Two thousand plus was considered high. 
The iguana tribe could only have one male leader. This meant other male iguanas couldn’t be too strong, or they would threaten the leader. 
“Help, save me!” 
The mother iguana, still angry, was suddenly grabbed by Goblin’s large hand and held in his arms, being rubbed all over. 
Just as he was about to proceed, he thought of something, “Oh, oh, this has to be saved for the boss.” 
He then knocked her unconscious with a slap. 
“Gobu Tian, hurry up and eat. You’re about to evolve, aren’t you?” 
Gobu Shan threw the roasted iguana over. 
“Monsters are invading!” 
“The lord isn’t here, what should we do?” 
“Why would monsters dare invade us? Didn’t the lord intimidate all the nearby ones?” 
“They seem to be from the goblin tribe!” 
“Doesn’t matter, grab your weapons and fight back!” 
Quickly, the iguana tribe gathered over a hundred males, but they were only two meters tall, much smaller than the Iguana Lord. 
Their strength was less than half of his. 
Gobu Kuang, seeing such a large group gathered, sneered and activated his skill, “Demonic Flame!” 
The two balls of eerie blue fire in his hands were thrown out. 
They exploded among the iguana crowd. 
“Ahhh!” 
Screams echoed continuously! 
Over a dozen iguanas were hit by the flames, unable to extinguish them no matter how hard they tried. 
Even burying themselves in the mud didn’t help. 
The slightest flame burned to the bone, melting their bones and burning through their bodies! 
Such was the power of the Demonic Flame. 
Similar to modern society’s white phosphorus bombs. 
On the other side, a large group of iguanas pinned Gobu Shan to the ground. 
They hammered him with hammers and stones, trying to crush him. 
The clanging sounds continued, but it was futile. 
His bone armor’s defense was far higher than iron armor, regenerating as soon as it broke. 
Gobu Shan, unable to move, simply gave up struggling and reshaped his bone armor. 
His entire body became like a porcupine, covered in sharp bone spikes! 
He instantly impaled over a dozen iguanas. 
Gobu Tian was beside him, collecting corpses and devouring them, finally starting to evolve. 
His small body didn’t change much, but a set of thin cicada wings grew from his back, and two antennae appeared on his front. 
He now looked somewhat similar to a cockroach. 
And, it also had a tongue similar to an iguana’s. 
It could capture the scent of enemies in the air, making it possible to detect them even if they were invisible. 
Golden scales began to appear on its skin, just like an iguana, but not just golden. In the blink of an eye, they turned black. 
Then green, white, purple, and other various colors! 
Finally, they became transparent, and its whole body only showed a faint outline, as if it were invisible. 
These scales could form camouflage, blending with the surrounding environment. 
Gobu Tian was still exploring his changes when the antennae on his head twitched. 
“Swish!” 
Gobu Tian quickly turned around and directly reached out to kill an iguana that was trying to sneak up on him. 
He remarked, “The antennae are light and sensitive, able to feel changes in the air to detect sneak attacks, not bad.” 
He then shook his wings and took off from the spot! 
Unfortunately, he couldn’t fly too high or too fast, but for sudden speed bursts during ground attacks, it was excellent. 
“Lord… where, where have you gone…” 
Not far away, an iguana holding a stone hammer stood still, full of despair. 
Before him, the scene had turned into a mountain of corpses and a sea of blood, with flames extending far. 
Three bizarre goblins were devouring his clan members. 
Even those not completely dead were being eaten bit by bit. 
“Burp~” 
“I’m full, let’s go back. The boss said not to annihilate them completely, let them reproduce, and we’ll come back.” Gobu Tian burped, feeling very satisfied. 
Gobu Shan nodded, “I’m full too. It’s good that I evolved; the boss will surely praise me!” 
“Let’s go then!” 
Gobu Kuang carried the mother iguana on his shoulder, holding a smaller one with his left hand. 
This puzzled Gobu Shan, “Isn’t that unnecessary? You don’t need to pack leftovers.” 
Upon hearing this, 
Gobu Kuang found a moment where someone else seemed dumber than him, “You ungrateful wolves, just caring about eating and enjoying yourselves, forgetting the boss? I’ll report you later!” 
“Hey, don’t. Next time we catch humans, I’ll give you more, okay?” 
… 
After they left. 
In the forest, the Golden Iguana Lord walked with a grim face, “Damn birdmen, damn goblins, once I find a way to get rid of the birdmen, all humans will be my food! And…” 
As he spoke, the hatred in his eyes deepened. 
He gritted his teeth, “I’ll also kill those damn goblins! How dare they disdain me!” 
When he reached the outside of his tribe, he tried to calm himself. 
He planned to relieve his stress with his wife when he got back. 
But the moment he entered, he felt like he was dreaming or had come to the wrong place. 
The Iguana Lord rubbed his eyes, “Impossible, impossible. Where is this? It feels familiar.” 
“Huh? Why does this person look so much like my uncle? And there’s my third brother, interesting.” 
The Iguana Lord muttered to himself as he looked at the barely recognizable corpses on the ground. 
Moreover, some bodies were covered in filth. 
It was obvious someone had desecrated them. 
Many iguana children’s bodies had turned into skeletons, with just a bit of flesh left. 
At this moment, a few iguana heads peeked out from the reeds nearby, “The lord, the lord is back!” 
“Great, we’re saved!” 
A few iguanas, dragging their battered bodies, hurried over. 
Seeing them, the Iguana Lord finally accepted this reality. He roared to the sky, “Who did this!!!” 
He couldn’t believe that as the lord, someone dared to ransack his home! 
That’s why he didn’t accept the reality at first. 
The iguanas cried, “It was three strange goblins, they must be high-tier. They were too strong, we couldn’t fight back, and… and the madam and daughter were taken.” 
“Goblins??!” 
The Iguana Lord’s pupils trembled. His wife and daughter were taken! 
He immediately thought of the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
But then he shook his head, “Impossible, I was just there. They couldn’t have come so quickly for revenge, and they wouldn’t dare!” 
He then speculated which goblin tribe in the enchanted forest could have done it. 
There were three goblin tribes in his southern territory, the strongest being Overlord variants under his control, so it couldn’t be them. 
In the east, apart from the Tian Kuang Tribe, there were no other Overlord goblins. 
There were some in the west and north, but they couldn’t have arrived so quickly. 
No matter how he thought, he couldn’t figure it out. 
The Iguana Lord was extremely aggrieved, “Hide well, I’m going to chase them!” 
He could only follow the scent. If he delayed, it would dissipate. 
He flicked out his tongue, capturing scents, his eyes lit up, “Found the scent of my wife and daughter!” 
He indeed headed in the direction Gobu Kuang and the others had gone, “I will slaughter your entire tribe!” 
At this moment. 
Gobu Kuang and his group had returned to the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
“Boss! Come quick! I brought you something good!” Gobu Kuang shouted happily. 
Lin Tian, who was thinking about how to cultivate new goblins, heard and came over. 
Seeing them, he didn’t care about the two iguanas they were carrying. 
Instead, he noticed they all had evolved! 
Especially Gobu Shan, who now looked so different that he wasn’t recognized at first glance, almost not resembling a goblin anymore. 
However, a goblin was defined not by appearance, but by character and habits.
