Chapter 99: Boss, We Need to Escape Quickly! 
TL: Sungmin  
“Gobu Yue, have you selected the thousand goblins?” 
Lin Tian walked to the eastern valley and spoke. 
Gobu Yue and the others were in charge of delivering and breeding. 
Because the number was too large, they were busy every day without rest. 
Upon hearing this, Gobu Yue looked around and said, “They are ready. Their parents are of top quality, and they have all developed fully. They are now big variants.” 
“Alright then, bring them out. I need to explain some things.” Lin Tian nodded. 
Immediately, a thousand fierce and well-trained goblins were brought to the western area. 
Seeing their fierce and sharp eyes, Lin Tian began to speak, “Do you know who I am?” 
Due to the recent months of frantic production, many goblins hadn’t even seen Lin Tian once. 
“Boss!” 
The goblins shouted in unison. 
They were exceptionally well-trained. 
At this moment, Goblin Slayer walked over. “Rest assured, they are all under my control. No need for any ideological work.” 
“I see.” Lin Tian felt relieved. This way, there was no need for any unnecessary talk. 
He directly ordered, “I will take you to a place later. Be honest on the way and don’t say a word to anyone except me.” 
“Understood, Boss!” The goblins responded in unison. 
They were essentially a large batch of death soldiers. If trained well, their combat power would be off the charts. 
Lin Tian looked at everyone and said, “Gobu Yue, continue to breed goblins frantically during this time. I will be away for a long time. If there’s any trouble, use the cannibal eagles. If you encounter danger, escape first.” 
Since it was uncertain if the church people would launch a sneak attack, it was better to give more instructions. 
“Okay, be careful too.” Gobu Yue nodded obediently. 
Lin Tian, along with these goblins and Alice, set off for the northern snowfield. 
They needed to distribute magic tools and have Alice teach them combat techniques and methods, which would take a long time. 
“By the way, if anyone from the Great Tomb comes, tell them I went to the Human Empire to scout.” 
He added this last sentence for insurance. 
To be safe, Lin Tian’s departure route avoided the tribes of intelligent beings to prevent them from reporting. 
If they encountered intelligent beings, they would kill them without hesitation. 
It took seven days to reach the northern snowfield. 
The cold made these big variants shiver, so Lin Tian quickly took out the Heart of Apollo. 
He chose a relatively hidden spot deep in the snowfield. 
Then he had the monsters look for a cave for better concealment. 
Soon, a long-haired snow mouse led them to a clearing. 
It burrowed into the snow. 
Lin Tian understood and signaled the other goblins to step aside, then increased the power of the Heart of Apollo, melting and evaporating a large area of snow. 
Indeed, a large cave entrance appeared. 
He then had them start a bonfire to prevent the snow from covering it again. The Heart of Apollo’s range was only ten meters, so many goblins had to take turns warming up. 
It was very laborious. 
After all the arrangements were made. 
Lin Tian summoned the snow spirits. 
“Swish, swish, swish…” 
The sound of ice crystal wings flapping echoed in the snow. 
One, two, three, dozens of snow spirits appeared! 
“Why are there so many goblins?!” 
The snow spirit leader exclaimed, though it felt slightly reassured upon seeing Lin Tian. 
Lin Tian frowned slightly. “In this hundreds of miles of snowfield, are there only this many snow spirits?” 
Dozens of snow spirits, producing a hundred snow crystals a day, wouldn’t be enough. 
In the later stages, it would take ten snow crystals to upgrade one goblin. 
“We can summon more, but it needs to be during a blizzard. Now it’s just regular snowfall…” The snow spirit said helplessly. 
Lin Tian’s eyes lit up. “You all go into the cave, Alice too. Don’t get frostbite.” 
Here, if you weren’t careful, parts of your body like fingers, toes, ears, and nose could get frostbitten. 
Without realizing it, they could fall off. 
Some goblins had already lost their ears. 
Then, Lin Tian activated the Blizzard Domain skill obtained from the Red-haired Yeti. 
It could change the weather environment. 
Sure enough, a heavy blizzard began to fall, making people marvel. 
In the blink of an eye, the cave was covered again, but it didn’t affect those inside. 
“Dear spirits, come quickly. This place is free and beautiful, always covered in holy white snow…” 
In the blizzard, the snow spirits began calling for their companions. 
Their melodious voices echoed. 
Within a few hours, a thousand snow spirits appeared. 
They fluttered like butterflies in the snow, happily dancing. 
Each snowflake was like a meal, bigger than half of themselves when held in their hands. 
Very cute. 
With over a thousand snow spirits, Lin Tian felt it was enough. Although snow spirits could revive after death, their actual lifespan was only three months. 
Short-lived yet beautiful. 
Three months was sufficient for Lin Tian. According to the system’s prediction, the Empire’s declaration of war was imminent. 
There were less than two months left. 
“I will ensure your safety. Just give me the snow crystals you produce,” Lin Tian said to the snow spirits. 
After receiving unanimous agreement, he dispelled the blizzard, clearing the surrounding area again. 
Now, he only needed to wait for the snow crystals. 
Without hesitation, he activated the Life Simulation System. 
He had no time to wait idly. 
In a flash, a month and a half passed. 
Lin Tian forcibly stopped the Life Simulation System, needing to leave himself some time to prepare. 
At least he had to run another life simulation before the battle. 
To predict the outcome of the fight. 
The goblins had consumed a large amount of snow crystals and almost all the magical creatures in the snowfield. 
The Great Tomb did not pay much attention to the snowfield, so there was no worry even if the magical creatures were completely consumed. 
Fortunately, the thousand goblins had all reached level seventy. 
They had all stably evolved into leader variants. 
Many were similar to Gobu Kuang’s ‘Enchanted Goblin’ but without four arms, thus weaker. 
They had consumed more magic crystals than flesh. 
Then there were mostly ‘Berserk Goblins’ and ‘Giant Goblins.’ 
There were also two mutated ones. 
Their evolution path had no special experiences, so they seemed ordinary. 
The leader variants of other powerful goblin tribes in the wild were generally like this as well. 
But Lin Tian never relied on mutation. Goblins were still goblins; their strength couldn’t compare to those truly talented races. 
No matter how many goblin kings there were, they could be easily defeated by others. 
Therefore, Lin Tian focused on obtaining as many magic tools as possible. 
“Alice, during this time, please be strict. Help them improve their combat skills,” Lin Tian said, time was pressing. 
Although there had been daily training before, their low level and weak intelligence likely made them forget most of it. 
Now that they were all leader variants, their intelligence was almost complete, making training much easier. 
He wouldn’t evenly distribute the upgrade resources; after some time, he could still promote a few overlord variants. 
Alice responded, “No need to be so polite, Messenger. For the ultimate holy war, I am willing to give everything.” 
“Huh?” 
Lin Tian felt she looked obedient when she said the last phrase. 
She kept staring at him. 
But he didn’t think much about it. It was time to distribute the magic tools. 
Based on each goblin’s overall ability, he allocated different magic tools, teaching them how to use them and in what situations. 
Only then could they achieve the strongest effect. 
This was how to create a batch of perfect killing machines. 
In about ten days, everything was settled. 
Before returning to the Tian Kuang Tribe, Lin Tian specially promoted an overlord-level mutant variant as the manager and named it ‘Gobu Jian.’ 
It looked robust and strong, about two meters tall. 
It wore a tenth-tier defensive armor magic tool and held a world-class longsword, the ‘Demon Sealing Sword.’ 
It could absorb all magic attacking it, even holy magic, and release it back. 
It was a ‘Sword Demon Goblin,’ with red skin that looked like it had been skinned, quite eerie. 
Lin Tian specifically asked Alice to teach it a few moves. 
It had strong talent in swordsmanship and special sword skill talent. 
Its overall strength was 5500. 
Very impressive. 
“Gobu Jian, you all stay here honestly. Don’t step out without my order, understand?” 
Lin Tian said. There were already many magical creature corpses piled up as food around them. 
In the ice and snow, there was no fear of decay. 
Hearing this, Gobu Jian nodded vigorously, “Understood, Boss. Everything we have is given by you. We will follow your orders!” 
“That’s good.” 
Lin Tian then followed Alice back to the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
Time was pressing. 
The Lionheart Empire could declare war any day. 
Upon returning, Lin Tian was shocked by the terrifying number of goblins! 
“In two months, how has the number doubled?!” 
Gobu Yue wiped the sweat off her brow and said, “Rebecca said we needed more goblins, so we used magical creature resources without restraint.” 
Eighty thousand small goblins, thirty thousand big variants, eight thousand hero variants, and a hundred leader variants. 
Just feeding them required consuming tens of thousands of magical creatures every day. 
Lin Tian clicked his tongue, “No wonder we only saw a few high-tier magical creatures and no low-tier ones on the way back. It seems the Great Tomb has bet everything on this.” 
“By the way, where’s Gobu Tian? Hasn’t he returned yet?” 
He looked around but didn’t see that guy. 
Logically, upon Lin Tian’s return, they should have been the first to come over and report what happened during his absence. 
Hearing this, Gobu Kuang shook his head, “I haven’t seen him for more than a month. I’m quite worried, Boss.” 
“That guy shouldn’t be…” 
Lin Tian frowned. He didn’t have time to look for him now, so he continued, “Goblin Slayer, how are the weapons?” 
Weapons were extremely important. 
Especially for low-tier goblins. Their defense wasn’t high, but there were many of them, so each needed an iron weapon. 
Each could stab once and kill those human soldiers. 
Goblin Slayer took out a small notebook and carefully calculated, “We’ve prepared fifty thousand short swords, twenty thousand sets of iron armor, and twenty thousand longswords. Other weapons total about five thousand.” 
Other weapons included shields, spears, and long lances. 
Unfortunately, there wasn’t enough time; otherwise, everyone could have an iron weapon and a set of custom iron armor. 
Lin Tian nodded, not demanding too much, “Well done.” 
“Boss, the situation has changed! We must leave quickly! We have no chance of winning!”
