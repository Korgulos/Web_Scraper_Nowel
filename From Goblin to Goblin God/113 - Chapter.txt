Chapter 113: The Cunning Veronica 
TL: Sungmin 
Even the Holy Mother was convinced, saying, “No wonder, I finally understand why Alice acted that way, and even Veronica was forced to this extent by you. 
Oh God, what kind of goblin is this? It even took the Divine Priestess Ifreya from Your hands…” 
With that thought, she gave up on resisting. 
She decided to perish along with the church. 
At least, the culprit behind Veronica’s Great Tomb would also cease to exist. 
“I don’t want to do anything, just to take this victory,” Lin Tian said coldly. 
The Lionheart Empire was a massive resource. 
Not to mention countless minerals, the total population of the entire country was over two million! 
Over two million! Excluding men, the elderly, and children. 
There would be at least five hundred thousand women. 
He couldn’t imagine how many goblins could be bred this time. 
With an average of three per birth, at the very least. 
That would be one and a half million low-level goblins in one go. 
In two months, it would be three million. 
There was no need to spend anything to raise them. As soon as they reached adulthood, they would be sent to attack cities. One and a half million goblins, even without weapons and armor, would be enough to severely damage an empire! 
They could destroy an empire in two or three months. 
So, to establish a foothold in this world, to no longer hide, to meet people openly. 
To sit at the same table with those imperial kings and demi-human leaders! 
He had to conquer the Lionheart Empire. 
Veronica understood and quickly said, “I have no interest in the Lionheart Empire, only a grudge against the church. I just want to live simply in a human city, how about that? If there’s an invasion, I can even help you.” 
“Well said, but do you think I would trust you?” Lin Tian said with disdain. 
Letting her go now would be like releasing a tiger back into the mountains. 
If she used her heretical summoning twice in a row, he would be done for. 
Not to mention the many powerful demonic followers she had. 
Veronica was also helpless. “Then what do you think would make you trust me? I can’t summon a soul contract right now.” 
She could summon the ferryman to complete a soul contract. 
But where would she find so much magic power? 
Lin Tian sighed. “So, you should just die. However, your death may not be quick.” 
Of course, he wouldn’t supply her with magic power to summon the ferryman. 
What if she summoned something else? That would be disastrous. 
Moreover, considering how Veronica had used him before, Lin Tian planned to take his revenge. 
“Don’t push me too far. I am still the master of the Great Tomb. If there’s nothing to say, then kill me!” Veronica, with her skeletal pride, said. 
She looked at Rebecca, “But I hope you can spare her. Considering her perfect body, you can slowly enjoy it, can’t you? As long as she stays alive.” 
At that moment. 
Veronica was ready to face death. 
She understood what the black witch meant by the birth of a new god. 
It was this goblin! 
An underestimated, historically most terrifying goblin! The most terrifying monster! 
A monster that took the Divine Priestess from God’s hands. 
Lin Tian thought for a moment, “Don’t worry, I’ll make sure she looks good. So, please die.” 
He pulled out the Spear of Zeus. 
“After all these years, am I finally going to die? That’s good too,” Veronica’s red light in her skull began to dim. 
Thinking about reincarnation as a human, she didn’t find it frightening. 
After all, there were beliefs in reincarnation in foreign lands too. 
Lin Tian started charging his lightning. 
There was no mercy, and he didn’t dare to show any. 
But suddenly! 
Veronica pleaded, “Wait, I don’t want to die yet. Can you think of a way to spare me? It’s really hateful that I don’t have a body, otherwise…” 
At that moment, even she, a lily, thought about using her body to survive. 
But she didn’t have that. 
She could only beg Lin Tian to reconsider. 
She didn’t want to die; she wanted to live. There were still many things she hadn’t done. 
When facing death, even the most stubborn people would fear. 
Unless they had an iron faith. 
But monsters had no faith. 
“You are truly interesting. Let me think about how to spare you?” Lin Tian found it amusing. 
Usually, it’s the one pleading who thinks of ways to be spared. 
Now, he had to think of ways to spare his enemy. 
In a panic, Veronica removed her cloak. 
Revealing her body completely, leaving nothing to the imagination! 
It was too explicit. 
This content couldn’t be broadcast. 
It was just a bunch of bones. 
However, seeing Veronica’s shy appearance, and those pinkish bones, 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but swallow. 
This guy. 
She was practically born with seductive bones. 
Believe it or not, some people have this kind of allure that just looking at their silhouette can make your heart race. 
When Veronica had flesh, she must have been top-notch. 
“Oh my, what is all this, is the world of monsters so chaotic?” 
Next to him, the Holy Mother couldn’t help but cover her eyes, her face flushed with embarrassment. 
Even though there was nothing to see, she inexplicably felt this was too racy. 
“So, do you have any interest at all?” Veronica whispered, not daring to be sure. 
After all, who would be interested in a pile of bones? 
Lin Tian coughed twice, “I do appreciate you, but that’s not a reason to let you go. If you recover your magic power and leave, I’d be the one to die.” 
Veronica, looking unconvinced, said, “Compared to her? If I had flesh, I wouldn’t be worse than her! Look!” 
She walked up to the Holy Mother, pushing her and comparing their figures. 
Lin Tian certainly appreciated the Holy Mother’s loving and divine demeanor and body more. 
At that moment, 
The Holy Mother felt a wave of embarrassment and shyness. 
She was actually being used as a comparison tool for the goblin, right here. 
How embarrassing. 
She quickly turned around, trying to calm her mind. 
Lin Tian was also absorbed in her shy and flustered demeanor. 
Internally, he still decided to deal with Veronica. 
After all, she was useless to him; he couldn’t control her, and she had no flesh. 
“Teleportation magic!” 
Suddenly! 
A magic circle appeared under Veronica’s feet. She quickly grabbed Rebecca’s hand. 
In the next second, the two of them disappeared from the spot. 
“Damn it!” 
Lin Tian cursed inwardly, wanting to chase after them but having nowhere to go. 
This was a disaster! 
The Holy Mother said despairingly, “She did this on purpose, making it impossible for me to maintain the Divine Might skill, escaping through a loophole, truly too…” 
Lin Tian’s expression was heavy; he hadn’t anticipated this outcome at all. 
That woman was indeed very difficult to deal with. 
He had underestimated her. 
He had focused solely on her powerful strength, forgetting how cunning she was! 
After all, she had endured for decades and even set traps to deal with the church. 
What had just happened was nothing to her! 
“Goblin… I won’t spare you!!!” 
In the dark sanctuary of the Great Tomb, Veronica’s cold and furious voice shouted. 
The entire Enchanted Forest trembled! 
Gobu Jian said gravely, “Boss, what should we do? Should we immediately hunt her down?” 
“It’s too late. If we go to the Great Tomb now, she has already recovered much of her power.” 
Lin Tian was full of regret, not expecting himself to make such a mistake. 
Now, the battlefield victory was harvested. 
But whether they could digest it, whether they had the life to enjoy it, was another matter.
