Chapter 187: Logging Off? No, There’s No Logging Off! 
TL: Sungmin 
The surrounding demi-human monsters were completely entranced as they stared. 
“Is this the famous beauty of Troy?! Such exotic charm, so beautiful!” 
“Compared to ordinary human beauties, this one is even more captivating.” 
“Tsk tsk, how envious I am of the one who gets to ravage her.” 
These monsters had no sense of propriety, expressing their thoughts bluntly. 
Naturally, the others wouldn’t take issue with the words of monsters. 
“A beautiful girl like this, is she really the president of a trade association?” Lin Tian asked provocatively. 
For a moment, the faces of the group clearly showed a hint of panic, but they quickly regained their composure. 
Muhammad Sara, the daughter of the King of Troy, hastily spoke up, “My father is the President of the Troy Merchant Guild. Since childhood, I have learned a lot about business from him, so this time, as I entered the Goblin Empire, I could be considered a branch president.” 
Lin Tian raised an eyebrow slightly. “Is that so? But recently, the number of merchants entering our empire has been increasing. There’s no space left for you.” 
“Hmm? What do you mean by that, Your Majesty?” Sara’s eyes, which were as clear as the sky, filled with confusion as she spoke.  
The people of Troy frowned. 
Although they weren’t here solely for business, they had brought hundreds of tons of goods to make their ruse more believable. 
The other empires had done the same. 
Even if there was no place to store the goods, it didn’t matter. 
Their true objective was to infiltrate and assassinate all the high-ranking goblins. 
But now, what should they do? 
Lin Tian’s eyes gleamed with malice as he licked his lips, staring at Sara. “What do you think? Don’t you understand basic social niceties? You humans, after all.” 
“Your Majesty, please be clear,” Sara said, a hint of disgust flashing in her eyes. 
Gobu Kuang and the others chuckled quietly. 
They knew exactly what Lin Tian was planning. 
Then, they heard him say, “Of course, there’s an unspoken rule. Play with me for a while, and I’ll let you into the city.” 
Upon hearing this, the male heroes of Troy were instantly enraged, ready to step forward. “What did you say?!” 
“Goblin, don’t go too far! How dare you insult our prin-” 
Sara was a princess, and these men were, in essence, her subordinates. Naturally, they couldn’t tolerate the goblin’s insult. 
However, Lin Tian’s gaze turned icy, locking onto the speaker. “Prin- what?” 
The atmosphere immediately became oppressive, and the people of the Troy Empire began to panic. 
Seeing their reaction, Lin Tian couldn’t help but laugh inwardly. 
Knowing their true intentions, he had deliberately provoked them to see how they would respond. 
Refuse the intimate interaction? 
Then their mission would fail. 
Agree? 
Lin Tian would profit handsomely. 
At this moment, Sara quickly tried to manage the situation. “Your Majesty, is there another way? We could offer money as a bribe.” 
“No, no, no. I’m not short on money right now. With the Goblin Empire thriving as it is, do you think we lack funds?” Lin Tian dismissed the idea without a second thought. 
Behind him, One-Eyed Owl and others couldn’t bear to watch any longer. “Kid, don’t go overboard. I think this is the biggest deal you’ve ever seen. Refusing it might make me want to knock some sense into you.” 
It was mostly outsiders expressing their confusion. 
The goblins, however, trusted Lin Tian without question and had no objections. 
“Big Sis, don’t worry. These cunning merchants wouldn’t give up on such a lucrative deal, right?” Lin Tian said, licking his lips maniacally, his behavior utterly perverse and arrogant. 
He wasn’t afraid of her turning on him. He was confident. 
The entire Troy Empire delegation looked gloomy, as if they had swallowed something foul. 
They didn’t know what to do. 
If they returned now, how could they still call themselves heroes? They’d be more like cowards. 
Sara, in her heart, wished she could tear Lin Tian to pieces. She had never encountered such a shameless goblin. 
Expected, yet completely unexpected. 
“President, why don’t we go outside and set up camp for now while we think of a solution?” a man with long, striped hair suggested reluctantly. 
He shot a glare at Lin Tian. 
A princess of her status could never be defiled by a goblin. 
He wanted to act on the spot, but he couldn’t say it outright, so he proposed camping outside first. 
At this moment, Lin Tian grew impatient. “Are you done? You’re wasting everyone’s time. If you agree, I’ll settle it quickly and let you into the city. But I need at least half an hour. Then again, looking at your president’s skills, it might be even faster. Kekeke~” 
Hearing such vulgar words, the heroes of Troy nearly lost their composure. 
But this was, after all, the goblins’ territory. They hadn’t gathered enough intelligence yet and didn’t dare act rashly. 
Though they were strong, they were heavily outnumbered. 
Faced with an army of millions, they could only be overwhelmed. 
After pondering for a long time, Sara finally came up with a solution. “Your Majesty, I’m currently in a… sensitive time. How about after it ends, I’ll offer myself to you then?” 
Hearing this, the people of Troy breathed a sigh of relief, secretly admiring her. “As expected of a princess!” 
To come up with such a perfect excuse—truly brilliant. 
Once they entered the city and gathered information for a few days, they could then make their move. 
It wouldn’t be a matter of offering her body; it would be a matter of taking lives! 
However, Lin Tian let out a sinister laugh. “I don’t mind at all. Since you’ve already decided, come on, beautiful President! If you’re shy, we can go to one of the nearby houses…” 
In an instant, the people of Troy were dumbfounded! 
“Goblin! You… you’re too shameless!” 
“Our President has already said so, can’t you wait a few days?” 
“A king of such a great empire, don’t you feel any shame?” 
Facing their accusations, Lin Tian chuckled. “Shame? Can shame compare to pleasure? I’m already losing my patience. I’m giving you one last chance to choose!” 
Even One-Eyed Owl felt embarrassed. “I really underestimated this guy, sigh!” 
Sara was on the verge of madness, her hatred for Lin Tian growing deep within her heart. 
But she was torn and hesitant! 
Which was more important—honor or her body? 
For the people of Troy, honor was more important than life itself. They would rather die bravely in battle than choose to live cowardly. 
But the body was tied to dignity, and dignity was equivalent to honor. 
It was an incredibly difficult choice. 
Finally, she said, “I agree with you, but please, show me some respect. Let’s wait until my sensitive time is over. For now, let’s…” 
“Let’s what?” Lin Tian asked, his eyes full of amusement. 
Sara bit her red lip, her face flushed all the way to her neck. She couldn’t bring herself to look at the people around her. “Let’s discuss it in the house.” 
“Alright, alright!” 
Lin Tian was overjoyed, eagerly following her into a house, first chasing everyone else out. 
The heroes of Troy stared in disbelief. “President! President! You can’t!” 
“Ahhh! Damn it!!!” 
“Goblin! I… I!” 
They all went berserk where they stood, but they had to force themselves to stay calm, veins bulging on their foreheads! 
If they acted now, it would make Sara’s sacrifice meaningless! 
Their hearts were filled with guilt and rage. “I will follow Sara for the rest of my life! Such a noble spirit of sacrifice—this is the true glory of Troy!!!” 
“Yes! Lady Sara is glorious!” 
“We must keep this secret when we return. Anyone who dares to speak of it, I’ll kill them!” 
After a long time, they finally managed to calm down somewhat. 
About an hour later. 
They watched as Sara, her clothes disheveled, came out, occasionally gagging. 
The people of Troy gritted their teeth, their fists clenched so tightly that they cracked. 
They lowered their heads, unable to bear looking directly at her. 
Lin Tian, on the other hand, was in high spirits, giving orders. “Make way! President Sara, you’ve really worked hard, but don’t forget our agreement.” 
Sara said nothing, merely leading the group forward. 
In a low voice, she muttered, “Disgusting, vile, shameless goblin, I will kill you! I’ll kill all the goblins!” 
… 
After the Troy Empire’s caravan and several hundred commoners entered the city, it was the Giant Elephant Empire’s turn. 
Lin Tian glanced over them, surprised to find their combat strength similar to that of the Troy Empire—about a dozen top-tier warriors. 
Their overall combat power was around 9,500, with only one or two exceeding 10,000. 
The remaining hundreds seemed to be genuine merchants. 
At the forefront was a woman in a red cloak, her face hidden, as if afraid of revealing her identity. 
She stayed at the back of the group, letting an old man lead. But Lin Tian could tell who was strong and who was weak with just a glance. 
He pointed and said, “Old man, step down. Let the woman in the red cloak speak to me.” 
“But, Your Majesty, she…” The old man stammered, clearly troubled. 
Lin Tian pushed him aside. “I don’t like repeating myself.” 
Helpless, the woman slowly stepped forward from the crowd.

Though not as powerful as Sara, this woman was equally troublesome. 
For instance, she could instantly animate the hundred-meter statue behind her, turning it into her puppet. 
The Giant Elephant Empire also had a unique trait: “Magic Dolls,” which could be shrunk with magic and carried around. 
When released, they could become enormous statues hundreds or even thousands of meters tall. 
With another cast of puppet magic, she could easily control the statue and conquer a city without much effort. 
Lin Tian brazenly lifted her cloak, raising her chin to scrutinize her. “Not bad. Do you understand the rules here?” 
Upon hearing this, the warriors of the Giant Elephant Empire clenched their teeth in fury! 
Some even contemplated abandoning their mission altogether. 
This was an outrageous insult! 
Perhaps only the fanatics from the Troy Empire, willing to sacrifice their lives for honor, would endure such treatment. 
“No way! Our… our President is also currently on her… cycle. Additionally, she has mouth ulcers, Parkinson’s disease, and athlete’s foot!” 
“Yes, yes, Your Majesty, please let us in. Our products are quite unique. Look at these dolls, how exquisite they are.” 
The group hastily tried to find excuses, scrambling to get out of the situation. 
Lin Tian glanced at the items in the carriage, his eyes narrowing. It seemed these were the magical dolls mentioned in the intelligence from the Ant People. 
He had previously sent the Ant People to gather information on various empires. 
Thus, when the time came, he would target these dolls first, significantly weakening the combat strength of the Giant Elephant Empire. 
He then said, “I don’t mind athlete’s foot, and as for that Parkinson’s tremor, I actually enjoy it.” 
“You…!” 
The old man from earlier was almost driven to death by anger. 
Even after coming up with all these excuses, it was useless. 
Just where was the goblin’s limit!?
