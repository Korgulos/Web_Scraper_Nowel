Chapter 157: The Fall of the Sword Kingdom, A New Wheel of History Begins to Turn 
TL: Sungmin  
“Boom!” 
A violent surge of demonic energy erupted skyward! 
The force sent over a dozen massive trees flying chaotically. 
Alice had fully transformed into a Darkspawn! 
Her entire body was now covered in a layer of black-red flesh, sprouting horns, with a pair of broken wings on her back. 
Her height surged to over three meters. 
Her claws were sharp and elongated. 
Her face, terrifying like a demon from hell, with blood-red eyes. 
In that moment, it felt as though the world had come to a standstill. 
Everyone was engulfed in the boundless demonic energy, even the goblins, creatures of darkness themselves, felt a deep, soul-crushing fear! 
The Darkspawn held the Ominous Blade, with the flesh spreading down like liquid. 
It wrapped around the entire Ominous Blade. 
Transforming it into a massive black broadsword. 
As he walked, he spoke, “The Master of War has returned! I! Shall sing a requiem for all of you!” 
“La~” 
“La la~” 
“La la la~” 
He had fought before, but always feigned weakness, so that Alice would have no choice but to entrust everything to him. 
In the distance. 
Sylph silently cursed, “We’ve been tricked, we shouldn’t have pushed that girl to the brink…” 
But it was too late for regrets now. 
“The blood here should be enough to fully restore my power. Kill! Let the slaughter begin!” 
Under the influence of that requiem. 
Everyone’s desire for bloodshed was ignited, a craving for blood, a thirst for war! 
Even Gobu Kuang, his eyes bloodshot, prepared to charge into the city. 
The imperial soldiers, who had been hiding and trembling in fear, were now possessed by a mad desire to fight. 
They forcefully pushed against the war wagons blocking the gates. 
Those who couldn’t push them aside, began scaling the walls, ready to kill. 
Sylph hesitated no longer, she had to kill this Darkspawn immediately, or he would throw the world into chaos. 
With a wave of her hand. 
Countless trees fell from the sky! 
All aimed at the Darkspawn! 
But the Darkspawn only sneered this time, “Earlier, I pretended to be afraid to deceive that foolish girl. Sylph, did you really think I feared you? Have you not heard my name?” 
“Swish!” 
With a single slash of his sword, several trees above were shredded into splinters! 
The blood-red blade gleamed. 
Like a grinder, it furiously shredded tree after tree! 
Edward couldn’t believe his eyes, “How… how is this even possible! Is that still a sword? It’s more like an endless display of destructive magic!” 
On the other side. 
With the hurricane dispelled, the goblins and imperial soldiers had begun to slaughter each other. 
The scent of blood hung thick in the air, nauseatingly strong. 
Sylph watched the Darkspawn, who continued to hack at the trees with increasing ferocity. 
Her pupils contracted in an instant! 
As if she had realized something, “You… you’re the World Destroyer, Atoreya!” 
“Keh keh keh! Let me think, it’s been thousands of years, hasn’t it? I’m surprised someone still remembers my name! Sylph, I’m touched!!!” 
Atoreya the Darkspawn said, utterly exhilarated. 
Then he mocked, “But, the once-mighty Wind King, reduced to such petty tricks?” 
Sylph fell silent for a moment, her mind racing to figure out how to eliminate this Darkspawn with her limited power. 
A few hundred years ago, a great battle had broken out among the elemental spirits. 
Many had died, and others were left with only a fraction of their former strength. 
Sylph was one of the survivors, barely clinging to life, her essence now residing within Edward, slowly recovering. 
But this also meant her power could not be fully unleashed. 
There was no way she could stop Atoreya’s resurrection. 
“Listen to that, the beautiful clash of metal, the roars of blood-soaked battle! This is how the world should be! It’s a good thing that wretched goblin isn’t here, or how could I have come this far so easily?” Atoreya raved madly. 
Soon enough. 
The thousands of trees were all reduced to fragments. 
Only leaves drifting on the wind remained. 
Sylph was filled with remorse, “Atoreya, aren’t you afraid of divine retribution? If you relinquish control of the girl’s body now, you might still survive. But if you continue your rampage, you could die in the next second…” 
This kind of threat only made Atoreya laugh, “How old are you? Are you trying to amuse me? Divine retribution? If the gods had time to deal with me, why don’t they first clean up this filthy, rotting world?” 
“I won’t let you continue this!” Sylph moved to attack once more. 
At that moment. 
From a distant underground location, a small black creature emerged. 
It looked very similar to a low-level goblin, but with a pair of ram’s horns. 
Its eyes weren’t red. 
Instead, they were hexagonal, like a magic array, glowing with a black light. 
Incredibly strange. 
It was the Child of the Evil God that Lin Tian had previously cultivated. 
“What a delicious smell, this place… is filled with food…” 
The Child of the Evil God crawled stealthily, scavenging the battlefield to gain experience and devour corpses. 
Just like a goblin, the more he consumed, the stronger he became. 
However, he could control his size, shrinking and growing at will, and he kept his current small form simply to avoid detection. 
In the blink of an eye, he had consumed tens of thousands of corpses. 
Suddenly, his eerie eyes focused on something nearby, “What is that? Such a delectable scent, I want to eat it!” 
He was staring directly at Atoreya and Sylph, who were locked in battle. 
He began to slowly approach them. 
At this moment, Edward had been beaten beyond recognition, his body covered in wounds and blood. 
But Atoreya had also sustained some injuries. 
The Child of the Evil God sniffed the ground and quickly found some Darkspawn blood, which had dripped from Atoreya’s wounds. 
Without hesitation, he licked it clean. 
His eyes lit up, “This taste… I’ve never savored such a delicacy before!” 
He then locked his gaze onto Atoreya. 
“Sylph, give up. I can let you continue to live. This world needs more strong beings to make it interesting.” Atoreya spoke arrogantly. 
He had already suppressed Sylph to the point where she had no strength left to fight back. 
Edward was barely clinging to life, his body so mangled it was hardly recognizable as human. 
Sylph, her power weakened, could no longer continue the fight. Suddenly, she noticed the pitch-black figure of the Child of the Evil God approaching from a distance. 
With one glance. 
Sylph felt the strange and disturbing power emanating from it. 
Just looking at it made her dizzy and disoriented, her mind in turmoil. 
She quickly averted her gaze, “What is that? It seems to be… an aberration?” 
Veronica wasn’t the only one who could summon aberrations; throughout history, many aberrant creatures had appeared. 
So Sylph had some understanding of them. 
Atoreya, noticing Sylph’s apparent refusal to surrender, narrowed his eyes coldly, “It seems I’ll have to kill you after all. So, say your goodbyes to this beautiful world, my Wind King!” 
Suddenly! 
Atoreya whipped around, sensing a dangerous presence drawing near! 
The Child of the Evil God had latched onto his leg, biting furiously. 
The blood-red flesh that had once resembled armor now tore as easily as paper, chunks being ripped away effortlessly. 
Blood gushed out. 
Atoreya was shocked; he had never seen such a strange creature before. It definitely wasn’t a goblin. 
As he prepared to strike and remove it. 
He suddenly felt a wave of disorientation. 
And then Alice’s voice echoed in his mind, “Let me go! This body is mine!” 
“Impossible! Her spirit was imprisoned by me, how could this be happening!” Atoreya wavered, nearly losing his balance. 
His eyes were filled with terror! 
It was fear! 
He, the embodiment of fear, was now experiencing a feeling of dread. 
And it was all because of the dark creature clinging to his leg! 
In desperation, he prepared to sever his own leg, knowing it could regenerate later. 
However, the Child of the Evil God wasn’t foolish. He quickly scurried all over Atoreya’s body, biting a chunk out before moving to another spot. 
Atoreya kept trying to shake him off. 
But the more he struggled, the more things felt wrong. 
His mind began to blur, as Alice fought with all her might to regain control. 
Finally. 
Atoreya managed to slice the Child of the Evil God in half and threw it away. Staggering, he nearly fell, “What the hell is this cursed thing! Why is my heart racing like this!” 
At this moment. 
Sylph saw a perfect opportunity! 
She immediately left Edward and charged toward Atoreya, “Human girl, hold on! I’ll help you reclaim control of your body!” 
In a rush, she dived in. 
And she prepared to form a pact with Alice! 
“Would you be willing to share your soul with me? I’ll help you fight and achieve victory!” Sylph’s anxious voice echoed in Alice’s mind. 
After a moment of silence, Alice gave a faint “Mm,” unable to afford any more hesitation. 
This was the perfect chance to reclaim control. 
Due to the interference from the aberration, Atoreya’s mind was unstable. 
It was as if even the gods were lending a hand. 
Divine providence. 
Immediately after. 
A green whirlwind began to swirl around Atoreya! 
A powerful spiritual force started to suppress him! 
“No! Lady Sylph, please don’t do this to me, I gave you a chance to live just now!” Atoreya cried out in panic. 
His unstable mind was no longer able to resist the overwhelming willpower of Alice! 
The black-red flesh began to slowly retract into the Ominous Blade. 
Alice’s body started to emerge, though remnants of the Darkspawn’s flesh still clung to parts of her. 
Finally. 
Under the combined suppression of Sylph and Alice. 
Atoreya was completely sealed back into the Ominous Blade, “No! That damned creature, I will kill you all!” 
“Gasp… Gasp… I… I’m back…” 
Alice knelt on the ground, panting heavily, her forehead drenched in sweat. 
Sylph finally breathed a sigh of relief, “Thank the gods! Darkspawn, you will never succeed…” 
“Honest to heaven, I only wanted to help fight, you’ve misunderstood me.” 
At that moment, Atoreya once again tried to disguise himself as a harmless and innocent figure. 
However, Alice would never believe him again. 
The goblins and imperial soldiers, who had been influenced by the requiem, gradually regained their senses. 
But once war begins, it cannot be easily stopped. 
It had become a near one-sided massacre by the goblins. 
Edward, dragging his heavily injured body, managed to move a few steps with great difficulty. 
The sky began to darken with rain. 
His life was like the sun that had already set, his body growing as cold as the falling rain. 
He turned back to glance at Alice, “Lady Sylph, will we meet again?” 
“Brave human, your soul will go to heaven, and we shall meet again there.” 
Sylph emerged from Alice’s body, speaking deeply. 
Her eyes shimmered with the hint of tears. 
“Boom!” 
In the distant city. 
The massive sword statue was destroyed and collapsed. 
Just like Edward, it fell to the ground. 
This kingdom collapsed along with it. 
For some, dreams were shattered. 
But for others, it meant a step closer to their dreams. 
Alice, having steadied herself, noticed the Child of the Evil God that had been sliced in two. 
It was still not dead; the two halves of its body were crawling towards each other. 
Trying to reconnect. 
“So this is the thing, huh?” 
Alice’s expression tightened as she quickly averted her gaze. 
She remembered that Lin had insisted on capturing the Child of the Evil God. 
This must be the creature he was after. 
… 
Child of the Evil God = Kid between Lin Tian and the Overlord Black Goat creature thingy.
