Chapter 138: The Aggrieved Protagonist, Let Me Help You Vent 
TL: Sungmin 
“I can still sense his location now. If you meet his gaze, you’ll go mad.” 
At this moment, Rebecca spoke with satisfaction. 
She explained the situation about the child. 
She was much calmer now. 
Lin Tian was still immersed in disbelief, “A succubus—why, why is she still pure???” 
He couldn’t believe it himself; he had slept with a pure succubus. 
What kind of succubus was this? 
“I can’t do anything with Lady Veronica, so of course, I’m pure.” 
Rebecca bit her red lip as she spoke. 
Lin Tian didn’t pursue this topic further but focused on the child, “Location? So where is he now?” 
“If I’m not mistaken, it should be the Magic Kingdom.” Rebecca continued. 
She had lived for a long time and had fought battles with the church, including the church pope of the Magic Kingdom. 
Naturally, she knew the location of the Magic Kingdom. 
Lin Tian squinted his eyes slightly, pondering. 
If the goblin had devoured so many people in the Magic Kingdom, what kind of monster would he become? 
He would become an unprecedentedly powerful goblin. 
He needed to inform Alice about the situation and keep an eye on it, seizing the opportunity to capture him before he grew too powerful. 
In the future, he would be a trump card against the super empires. 
They all had demigods as their mainstay. 
Anyway, this Black Goat Goblin could be considered a demigod, capable of contending with them. 
“Dear, where are you going?” 
Seeing Lin Tian about to leave, Rebecca asked reluctantly. 
Lin Tian shot her a cold glance, “Stay put.” 
She could still serve as a locator, which was quite important. 
Then. 
He explained everything to Alice, hoping she would keep an eye on things. 
“I will.” Alice nodded calmly. 
Lin Tian didn’t say much more; he trusted her to handle things. 
With that, everything that needed to be done was done. 
He then mounted his dragon and headed towards the War Empire. 
“Xiao Huan, once we reach the War Empire’s territory, you should return by yourself to avoid being discovered. I’ll figure out a way to get back.” Lin Tian said on the way. 
It was very dangerous outside, especially since they were heading to the Dragon Slayer Guild. If a dragon was discovered, the consequences would be dire. 
After entering the War Empire’s territory, Lin Tian proceeded alone, estimating it would take some time. 
But now, he lacked everything except time. 
The Goblin Empire was thriving, no longer living in constant fear. 
Even if multiple countries joined forces, they could handle it. 
He came to a rural path. 
Lin Tian walked openly, not knowing the exact location of the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
So, he just needed to wait for some unlucky folks to come by. 
“Haha, my wife gave me three sons, I’m really busy…” 
“You always show off. I doubt I’ll ever get a wife in my lifetime… huh? What’s that?!” 
On the path, two plainly dressed young men were chatting. 
They were carrying several fresh fish and a wild rabbit. 
It looked like they had just returned from hunting. 
They noticed Lin Tian walking towards them. 
The blond young man said warily, “A goblin! Do we have goblins causing trouble here too?!” 
“Don’t worry so much, goblins are weak. Let me kill him and maybe the village girls will love me!” 
The young man carrying the fish and holding a pitchfork brightened up with interest. 
Now was his chance to show off. 
The blond young man remained cautious, “Be careful, I’ve heard goblins are pack creatures, there might be more around.” 
The pitchfork young man didn’t care and aimed the fork at Lin Tian’s head, throwing it with precision! 
His fish-catching skills were top-notch in the village. 
He believed he would surely succeed. 
He already imagined holding the goblin’s head and making the village girls swoon. 
However. 
Lin Tian didn’t even dodge; he casually caught the pitchfork. 
A sinister, cold smile appeared on his grotesque face. 
The two young men, frightened, took a few steps back. 
“How could this be?!” 
The pitchfork young man was shocked; he hadn’t killed the goblin in one blow. 
He prepared to grab the blond’s bow to continue the attack. 
Seeing this, Lin Tian didn’t give him the chance. With a strong flick of his wrist, he sent the pitchfork back. 
It pierced directly into the young man’s chest. 
The force was so terrifying that he was thrown backward. 
Seeing this, the blond young man dropped the rabbit in fear, staring at the bleeding wound with a blank mind, completely panicked. 
He hurriedly pulled out the pitchfork. 
But this only worsened the injury, a wrong method of treatment. 
Blood gushed from the three wounds like a floodgate opening. 
“Am I going to die? Freya, save me, I don’t want to die!” 
The pitchfork young man’s face was filled with fear, “How could I die at the hands of a goblin? When you go back, don’t tell anyone. I don’t want to be a laughingstock!” 
His voice was trembling, his lungs and liver severely damaged. 
“Unfortunately, he won’t be going back. But don’t worry, you won’t become a laughingstock.” 
Lin Tian’s voice slowly approached them. 
The blond young man saw this and his expression changed drastically. Terrified, he retreated a few steps and hurriedly drew his bow to shoot at Lin Tian. 
But the scene before him scared him even more! 
He saw Lin Tian devouring his companion piece by piece! 
“What are you doing! Damn goblin!!!” 
The blond young man’s legs turned to jelly, and he fell to the ground, his face contorted in fear. 
His eyes bulged as if they would pop out of their sockets. 
He had never seen such a bloody and terrifying sight. 
He couldn’t even hear his friend’s cries for help. 
Let alone attack. 
This was exactly the effect Lin Tian wanted. He then used Abnormal Fusion to devour the young man, transforming into his appearance. 
“Monster! What kind of monster are you!” 
The blond young man tried to get up, but his legs wouldn’t obey. They twitched uncontrollably, making it impossible to stand. 
He was utterly terrified by the goblin that had transformed into his friend. 
Lin Tian stepped on him, “Don’t be afraid, I am your friend now. Let me ask you something, where is the Dragon Slayer Guild? If you answer honestly, you can save many lives.” 
If he didn’t answer, Lin Tian would have to go to the village to find out. 
He couldn’t guarantee what would happen there. 
The blond young man’s stomach churned with fear, and his tongue twisted. 
Seeing his state, Lin Tian frowned and didn’t wait for him to recover. 
With a slight effort, he crushed him to death. 
“Your cowardice will not harm just you.” 
Then, Lin Tian walked in the direction they came from. 
Soon, he saw a village. 
At the entrance, a group of young girls were using wooden sticks to help thresh the harvested beans. 
They had to hit the pods hard to make the beans fall out. 
In such a village, without books to read, children started helping with work at around ten years old. 
Though they were in the prime of their youth. 
For them, it was a habit, and they even enjoyed gossiping together. 
So, they would help one family with the beans and then move to the next. 
They worked and chatted at the same time. 
Lin Tian listened from a distance, marveling at how girls were the same in any world. 
There were a lot of people, so he should be able to gather some information. 
And these young, beautiful girls, Lin Tian couldn’t bear to kill them. 
Although he was a goblin, it didn’t mean he had to kill everyone he met. That would make him no different from a mad dog. 
“Andy? Where’s Freya’s brother? Why didn’t he come back with you?” 
Seeing Lin Tian, the girls questioned him. 
Their eyes were filled with confusion. 
Lin Tian gave an awkward smile, disguising himself, “Oh, he fell into the river while fishing. He’s drying his clothes on the mountain and will come back when they’re dry.” 
However, this aroused the suspicion of a red-haired girl, “You’re lying. He never fishes, he hunts. Did you kill him? Just like you killed your sister!” 
??? 
Lin Tian was confused. What did she mean by killing his sister? 
“We’re talking to you! Explain clearly! Don’t tell us Andy fell into the river like your sister did and was swept away! You murderer!” 
The red-haired girl threatened him with a stick. 
All the girls were wary of him. 
Their expressions were full of disdain. 
Lin Tian was baffled and began to read this body’s memories. 
Suddenly, everything became clear. 
He had wondered why this young man, clearly more handsome, was still unmarried while the blond had children. 
It turned out the villagers wrongly believed he had killed his sister. 
But according to the original owner’s memory, his sister had indeed been swept away in a rapid current, disappearing within seconds. 
He couldn’t save her in time. 
“Enough, you guys are really aggressive. Let me ask you something, do you know where the Dragon Slayer Guild is?” 
Lin Tian didn’t want to continue pretending. There was no way to explain this. 
He decided to be straightforward. 
If someone answered honestly, he would leave. 
The red-haired girl, however, like a detective eager to show off, shouted, “He’s guilty! He’s changing the subject! Go call the adults, Freya’s brother has been killed by him! Murderer!” 
Seeing her arrogant and smug expression. 
She really deserved a beating. 
Lin Tian hadn’t felt such hatred for someone in a long time. Even though he wasn’t the original person, he still felt angry. It was like watching those infuriating videos online. 
Even though he wasn’t the main character, he still got mad. 
“This original owner was really aggrieved, just letting the villagers label him as the one who killed his sister? Tsk tsk tsk…” 
Lin Tian sighed again. If it were someone else, they would have lost their temper long ago. 
But according to the memory, he blamed himself for his sister’s death. 
He didn’t jump in to save her in time. 
“Since I’m here, I’ll fulfill your dying wish. At least using your appearance.”
