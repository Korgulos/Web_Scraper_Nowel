Chapter 182: Searching for the Evolution Method 
TL: Sungmin 
With Katheryn’s help, using magic, the Goblin soldiers, dwarves, and dragons were all transported back. 
However, Lin Tian asked, “Dragon Mother, how long will it take for Ferbis to recover? I still need to pick her up.” 
Ferbis was the name of the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother. 
The Flame Dragon Mother was currently directing the dragons into the teleportation array in an orderly manner. 
Hearing this, she replied, “Judging by the time, it seems she’s almost ready. How about we go pick her up now?” 
“Sure, let’s go!” Lin Tian nodded. 
Immediately, the Flame Dragon Mother instructed the dragons to wait there. After Lin Tian mounted her, they headed towards the World Tree. 
Feeling the exhilaration of speeding through the sky, Lin Tian suddenly thought of something. “I get it now! No wonder you wanted to come with me alone. So, after that time, did you lay any dragon eggs?” 
“Hmph, that’s none of your business. My child won’t acknowledge you as its father either,” the Flame Dragon Mother retorted, somewhat shy, avoiding any mention of their previous encounter. 
Lin Tian shrugged, feeling helpless. 
He couldn’t help but say, “Speaking of which, don’t let Little Black’s fierce appearance fool you. Deep down, she’s just a child and wouldn’t even think about vying for the Dragon King’s position.” 
“Then why didn’t you say so earlier? And you still went and…!”  
Immediately, the Flame Dragon Mother fumed, shaking vigorously. 
Lin Tian quickly held on tight. “Hey, hey, can you blame me? You were sincerely begging me, how could I refuse?” 
“You despicable goblin, hmph!” The Flame Dragon Mother snorted before speeding up. 
The fierce wind howled past Lin Tian’s ears, forcing its way into his eyes and nose, making it quite uncomfortable. 
Her speed was even faster than Little Black’s. 
What would have normally taken half a day was covered in just two hours as they arrived at the World Tree. 
Upon entering the lava zone, Xiao Huan immediately flew up excitedly, though she was still full of fear towards the Flame Dragon Mother. 
“Here we are, I’m here to take you home,” Lin Tian said with a grin. 
Though Xiao Huan was slow, she had helped him a lot. 
He promised himself that he would ensure her remaining days were comfortable. 
Soon after, the Flame Dragon Mother dove into the lava cave, gently picking up a fiery, unhatched dragon egg with her mouth. 
Lin Tian then headed towards the root area of the tree. 
From a distance, he noticed something emitting a dazzling purple light. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother had completed her rebirth in a brand new form! 
At two or three hundred meters long, she was still technically a young dragon. 
Now, thanks to absorbing the Dragon Crystal, her entire body was covered in a layer of radiant amethyst, dazzling and captivating. 
It even gave off an almost unreal feeling. 
“Mm?! You’re here. Where’s Little Black? And everyone else? Did we win against the War Empire?” The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother asked curiously, full of doubt. 
Lin Tian nodded. “We won. Your ancient dragons needn’t fear being hunted anymore, and you can live carefree in a new place. Little Black is probably still playing around in the Goblin Empire.” 
Hearing this, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother was ecstatic. She transformed into her human form and said, “It’s unbelievable. Just a little over a year ago, you were just a goblin from a tribe, humbly seeking a partnership with me…” 
Such an overwhelming, terrifying transformation. 
Only those who witnessed it firsthand could truly grasp how shocking it was. 
“Yes, if it weren’t for you holding off the humans, I might not be where I am today. Let’s go, tell the world that the Crystal Dragons are not extinct!” Lin Tian said with a satisfied smile. 
Having absorbed enough power, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother’s crystal abilities had fully developed. 
Upon exiting, the Flame Dragon Mother’s expression slightly shifted. “Ferbis, you’re just a few decades old, yet you’ve fully mastered the crystal ability. In the future, you might even surpass the old Dragon King.” 
“Dragon King, it’s all thanks to him,” the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother replied calmly. 
And so, they bid farewell to the World Tree, which had sheltered them for so long. 
Along the way, people from various empires fled in terror at the sight. 
However, the Purple-Gold Dragon Mother rode on the Flame Dragon Mother’s back to reduce resistance and avoid being seen. 
The Crystal Dragon was the only kind that wasn’t afraid of dragon-slaying weapons. 
Her body was naturally armored with incredibly hard crystal. 
Moreover, she could launch ultra-long-range, large-scale attacks with crystal, making her formidable in single combat, as opponents couldn’t even get close. 
One could say that the Crystal Dragon was the true apocalyptic dragon. 
The One-Eyed Owl only managed to fight close quarters with her because the old Dragon King insisted on confronting her head-on. 
So, Lin Tian thought it best not to expose her to human eyes for now. 
Upon returning to Twilight City, they teleported all the soldiers, dwarves, and dragons together. 
“Ferbis, come with me first. We need to secure our homeland. You can come visit whenever you want.” 
Hovering above the Goblin Empire’s square, the Flame Dragon Mother spoke. 
At this moment, Little Black had also returned. 
The Purple-Gold Dragon Mother nodded, “No problem, finally something fun to do!” 
She had initially left the lava cave because she found it too boring, deciding to venture out and become a Dragon King herself. 
Lin Tian then turned to Adele, “Have you decided? Will the dwarves live in the city, or do you want to build your own? The expansion of the royal city is almost complete, so we could set aside a separate area for you.” 
The value of the dwarves was immeasurable. 
It would be best if they could stay in the main city. 
Even though there were millions of goblins, Lin Tian had already built multiple empty cities for them to live in. 
Under the King’s control, the goblins had no desires; as long as they were well-fed and had a place to sleep, they were content. 
They were no different from raising pigs, obedient and without complaints. 
The main city only needed a reserve force of a million goblins. 
Hearing this, Adele still said, “The dwarves prefer to build their own city. Thank you for your offer.” 
“Yes, Your Majesty Lin Tian, many of us are accustomed to our old way of life, but for me, this royal city is simply amazing! By the way, have you tried the rabbit girl’s mouth-chewed wine? In my opinion, it’s the best wine ever!” Bill chimed in, savoring the memory. 
Lin Tian had little interest in the mouth-chewed wine; he could have it anytime he wanted from the rabbit girl. 
Since the dwarves wanted to build their own city, there was no helping it. 
In any case, it was only a few kilometers away, and it was just a small city. 
Then he looked at Gobu Yue, “Little Yue, where are the One-Eyed Owl and the others?” 
“Gobu Kuang is leading them around the city. Should I call them back?” Gobu Yue replied. 
Lin Tian waved his hand, “No need for that. By the way, could you all wait a moment? I have a question.” 
In the air, the Flame Dragon Mother paused, and Adele and the others also halted. 
“So… do any of you know anything about goblin evolution, or perhaps any legends related to it?” Lin Tian couldn’t help but ask, reaching out to ruffle Gobu Yue’s head. 
She hadn’t evolved yet, which was truly frustrating. 
Unfortunately, the Flame Dragon Mother didn’t know much either. “I don’t know much about goblins, but as for evolution, I’ve heard that constant devouring can lead to evolution.” 
“Alright then, you should head to the Great Tomb. Remember to find the Cannibal Eagle Tribe and tell them I sent you,” Lin Tian instructed. 
The cannibal eagles, due to their habits, preferred living in trees. They had been staying in the Great Tomb to care for their tribe. 
Moreover, the strength of the Cannibal Eagle Tribe had reached its peak. 
They wouldn’t be much help in future battles, and a peaceful life there suited them well. 
Looking at Adele, Lin Tian asked, “What about you, Your Majesty, Master Bill?” 
“Well… apart from drinking, sleeping, and… other things, we dwarves don’t know much. Oh, right, we do have some knowledge of forging magic tools,” Bill replied with an apologetic smile. 
Since none of them knew, there was nothing more to be done. 
After all, the situation was indeed very unique. 
He thought about asking the One-Eyed Owl and the others, but it seemed unlikely they’d know either. 
Soon, the once-bustling square became quiet again, leaving only Lin Tian and Gobu Yue standing there, lost in thought. 
Lia now usually lived with the elves, although she still resided within the kingdom. 
Goblin Slayer also stayed with her. 
Or sometimes, the three of them, including Gobu Yue, helped with logistical matters. 
Gobu Tian and his group would go on patrols when they had nothing to do. 
Alicenia was even busier, spending every day training troops to build a powerful elite force. 
Katheryn and Ifreya lived in the cathedral. 
Perhaps Ifreya had regained her memories, but she could only obey Lin Tian’s orders. 
As for the vampire Lilith, she had long ago taken Dracula’s coffin and hidden away. 
“Sigh, Little Yue, why do I feel a bit empty?” Lin Tian sighed. 
Gobu Yue hugged him tightly, “Boss, how could that be? I’m always by your side. I’ll never leave you.” 
“Haha… that’s true. Come on, I just remembered someone who might know how we can evolve.” Lin Tian’s eyes lit up. 
The two of them headed to the palace dungeon. 
Gobu Jian immediately came over to salute, “Boss…” 
“How’s that person?” 
“Everything’s under control. She seems to have given up resisting and hasn’t spoken in a long time.” 
That person was none other than the master of the Great Tomb, the undead, Veronica. 
Lin Tian pushed open the door and saw her body tightly bound, looking no different from a skeleton. 
But when she saw Lin Tian, her eyes suddenly lit up with a red glow. “Damn goblin! Keep me locked up as long as you want. Let’s see how long you can keep me here. My hatred will only grow deeper. Once I’m free, I’ll make sure you wish you were dead! I’ll kill everyone around you!” 
“Hmph, stop threatening me. By the time you get out, I might already be dead,” Lin Tian scoffed. 
He wasn’t one to be easily scared. 
Then, his expression turned serious. “If you can tell me something useful, I can grant you one request. Of course, don’t even think about asking to escape.” 
“Is that a promise? My dear Goblin Majesty!”  
In an instant, Veronica’s tone changed completely, her skeletal face looking almost innocent and harmless. 
Lin Tian wasn’t fooled by her act—he knew Veronica was a ruthless and cunning individual, full of deceit. 
He got straight to the point, “You must have noticed by now that I’m still just a low-level goblin, and so is she…” 
As he spoke, he removed Gobu Yue’s cloak, revealing her cute face. 
Upon seeing this, Veronica’s expression changed dramatically! 
She was filled with disbelief and shock!
