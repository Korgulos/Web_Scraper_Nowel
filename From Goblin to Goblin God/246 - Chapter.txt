Chapter 246: Breaking the Cocoon, Rebirth, and Power Surge! 
TL: Sungmin  
The next day. 
Lin Tian and Alice returned to the Goblin Empire to handle various matters. 
First, Alice needed to practice the sword techniques she had learned. She had to sharpen her skills to fully master them. 
Otherwise, those techniques would just go to waste. 
As for Lin Tian, others had already made the necessary arrangements, but he also needed to boost his own power. 
With only a power level of 17,000, he didn’t feel confident about defeating the Lust Demon King. 
And when it came to angels? He could probably only handle a low-tier one at best. 
“At this rate, it’s no good. My power has hit a bottleneck, and if I want to improve, I’ll have to start hunting demigods…” 
Inside the grand hall. 
Lin Tian sat on the throne, his brow furrowed in deep thought. 
Even though he had the system, when his power reached an impassable point, the system became ineffective. 
By now, he had already ‘extracted’ power from many powerful female beings. 
His equipment was also top-tier, meaning he had reached a plateau. 
Just as he was racking his brain, an idea suddenly occurred to him. 
Earlier, when he and Gobu Kuang had gone to hunt the Goblin King, he had devoured a skill called “Rebirth.” 
This skill allowed him to transform into a cocoon upon death, and after a certain amount of time, he would resurrect, stronger than before! 
It was somewhat similar to the Phoenix’s rebirth from ashes, an incredibly powerful skill. 
However, the cooldown period was quite long—an entire month. 
Without hesitation. 
Lin Tian took out the sharp Spear of Zeus. “Let’s give this a try…” 
Without a second thought. 
He plunged the spear straight into his heart! 
“Plchhh!” 
The intense pain twisted Lin Tian’s face slightly, his muscles spasming. 
He could clearly feel the electrical currents buzzing and numbing his body! 
His breathing became increasingly labored and difficult. 
The sensation of blood trickling down his skin was eerie—a primal fear from his genes about injury. 
His vision began to blur. 
His mind grew increasingly sluggish, the pain dulling as he approached unconsciousness. 
Summoning the last bit of his strength, Lin Tian pulled the spear out. 
Otherwise, there would be no “Breaking the Cocoon,” just a real game over. 
“Thud…” 
As his body weakened, he collapsed to the ground. 
Lin Tian was no stranger to this feeling, nor was he afraid of it. His resolve to grow stronger fueled his motivation. 
This was nothing in comparison. 
At that moment, the Rebirth skill activated. Since it was a passive skill, it triggered on its own. 
His skin began to swell, unraveling like silk threads, forming clear, cotton-like textures. 
It wrapped his entire body, until he was fully enclosed, resembling a white cocoon. 
“Hiss!” 
Inside the cocoon, Lin Tian suddenly took a deep breath, coming back to life. His wounds healed, and his blood and flesh that had turned to silk regrew. 
But the new flesh was still extremely tender. 
Much like a newly hatched cicada, his body was as soft as jelly at first. 
Later, it would harden considerably. 
Absorbing the nutrient fluid made from his own blood and flesh, Lin Tian broke out of the cocoon. 
His entire body felt weak, as if he had just fought for days and nights straight! 
Gradually, he recovered. 
Finally, his power level stabilized. 
“A thousand point increase!?” 
Lin Tian stared at his status screen in disbelief. He hadn’t expected such a large improvement. 
With another year to go, he could use this skill at least eleven more times, which meant over 10,000 in power! 
But he quickly dismissed the idea. 
The gains would likely diminish over time, and eventually, there would be no further increases. 
At most, this super-tier skill could provide a total boost of 3,000 power points. 
Still, that was already quite impressive. 
Both his physical strength and defense had significantly improved. With a few more tries, ordinary swords might not even be able to cut him anymore. 
Seated once more on his throne. 
Lin Tian continued to contemplate how to further enhance his strength. He needed to reach 20,000 at the very least. 
He was still 2,000 short. 
“The system shows I have more than 400 life points now. I could exchange them for new skills… Maybe I’ll wait until I reach 500 points,” Lin Tian thought aloud. 
With 500 points, he could exchange for far more powerful items, perhaps even mythic-class skills. 
He could gain life points by doing various tasks, and every new title he earned came with skill point rewards. 
By refreshing the simulation attempts, Lin Tian could tackle harder storylines, like attacking the Demigod Empire or challenging deities. 
These more difficult scenarios awarded more points. 
He pondered. 
Lin Tian decided to simulate life once again to gather the 500 points he needed for an exchange. 
“System, start the Life Simulation. I want to find the Lust Demon King.” 
“Life Simulation is starting: Current scenario — Forbidden Lust. 
[Due to a wrong turn in the fog, you accidentally provoked the Lust Demon King, Scarlett. Anyone who catches her attention usually meets a tragic end. 
However, you took the initiative to attack first, ‘assaulting’ everyone you knew, which left them extremely embarrassed. 
Once they recovered, you went into the streets of the empire. Anyone who even had a thought of seducing you? You attacked them all. 
The female beastkin and monster women thought they were about to experience happiness, only to be struck down by your holy powers, leaving them battered. 
After confirming their normality, you always used a Super Recovery Potion to heal them and even gave them twenty gold coins as compensation. 
This continued for ten straight days. 
Those female beastkin and monster women, who were once fanatically obsessed with you, started covering their pants and fleeing at the sight of you, terrified! 
They even gave you a title—’Lady Killer.’ 
However, every time you visited the Bunny Girl Tavern in the southern part of the city, a female beastkin would seduce you, and after finishing the deed, she would hastily flee without even asking for a Super Recovery Potion or gold…]” 
Seeing this, Lin Tian frowned slightly. The Bunny Girl Tavern in the southern part of the city? 
That was probably where the Lust Demon King operated, since the southern part of the city was closest to the Zerg Empire. 
He ordered, “Stop the simulation.” 
“This simulation has ended. Score: 100! Reward: 100 life points! 
Summary: Your strength exceeded everyone’s expectations. In just ten days, you made half of the royal city’s female beastkin and monsters suffer terribly, earning you a perfect score!” 
Seeing this summary, Lin Tian couldn’t help but smile.  
It was quite a confidence boost. 
But then his expression hardened. “The southern tavern, huh? I think it was called Bunny Girl Tavern No. 7… Heh, I’m coming for you…” 
Perfect timing. This would also help him preserve his reputation. 
He wouldn’t have to use the ‘attacks’ from his holy powers, which might hurt their delicate bodies. 
That way, future elite female beastkin and monster women wouldn’t hear the rumors of the “Lady Killer” and become too scared to offer themselves up. 
That would be a huge loss. 
With that in mind, he immediately got up and headed to Tavern No. 7. 
… 
“Welcome, Your Majesty the Goblin King!” 
As the bell above the tavern door chimed, Lin Tian stepped in, and the entire tavern staff greeted him enthusiastically. 
Each of their faces beamed with sweet smiles. 
“Would you like a drink, Your Majesty?” 
“Would you like something to eat?” 
“Or… would you like to enjoy us~?” 
Watching their warm service, Lin Tian waved them off and acted casual. “Just passing by. I’ll have a drink.” 
He picked a seat and sat down. 
The other beastkin and monsters drinking in the tavern ground their teeth in envy. “Damn it, why don’t we ever get that kind of service?” 
“Aren’t the bunny girls supposed to be the purest?! My goddess!” 
“Ugh, I’m so jealous of His Majesty!”
