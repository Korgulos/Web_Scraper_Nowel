Chapter 174: Despair, the Dusk of Twilight City! 
TL: Sungmin 
At this moment. 
Grugia and the others also woke up. 
Although they hadn’t yet figured out the situation, as soon as they saw Landau on the ground, they rushed up to strangle him! 
The exhausted Katheryn was busy healing him just as he was about to be choked to death. 
“Aiya… Your Goblin Majesty, please come quickly, what’s gotten into them?” 
Finally, Katheryn had no choice but to call for help. 
The One-Eyed Owl turned around and shouted, “Enough! We’ll deal with that guy later. First, follow Andy—no, what’s your name?” 
“Lin Tian…” 
“First, follow Lin Tian to Twilight City to slaughter a god!” The One-Eyed Owl roared boldly. 
Speaking of god-slaying, it wasn’t exactly accurate. Alexander, like the One-Eyed Owl, was also a descendant of a demigod. 
With diluted bloodlines and no special divine powers, they were just far superior to ordinary people in every aspect. 
Grugia snapped out of his rage, “Big Sis?! What’s going on around here? And who is this Lin Tian?” 
Everyone was filled with dread. 
They realized that their surroundings were even more terrifying and dangerous than they had imagined! 
“Dragons, monsters, dwarves, goblins… Is this hell? Fine, fine, in hell, I can kill him countless times!” 
Grugia cursed as he turned to kill Landau again. 
Seeing this, Osius quickly came over and explained the situation to everyone. 
After hearing this. 
Grugia looked at Lin Tian with eyes full of disbelief, much like his earlier state, “You, you’ve got such a big setup! Damn it, that’s really annoying! I won’t dare mess with you anymore.” 
“Thank you, brother!” 
“I don’t even know how to repay you for saving my life, sigh!” 
“I knew something was off when he saved Big Sis from the Ironhorn Tribe, but I didn’t expect his true identity to be so intense!” 
“Goblin? It seems the definition of this race needs to be refreshed—not just by me, but by the entire world.” 
The remaining dozen members of the Dragon Slayer Guild sighed. 
Lin Tian then slowly walked up to Landau, “Big Sis, how do we deal with him?” 
“Damn goblin… Demon, madman! You’re a monster, why are you helping them? I knew from the beginning it was you who shattered my magic tool, what on earth…” Landau said bitterly. 
As soon as he saw the weapon in Lin Tian’s hand, he knew his identity. 
Upon hearing this, Osius was startled once again, “Was it you who shattered the Death Eye of Demon King Fischer? So that means we owe you two lives now—no, with Joan of Arc, that makes three?” 
Suddenly, the entire Dragon Slayer Guild fell silent, their expressions complicated. 
Even the One-Eyed Owl’s expression changed slightly, “You shattered the Death Eye? May I challenge you?” 
She said with a cold smile, placing a hand on Lin Tian’s shoulder. 
She couldn’t defeat the Demon King. 
But a monster capable of shattering the Demon King’s Eye was at least half a Demon King, right? 
Worth challenging. 
“Don’t mess around. I’m not one for senseless fighting; let’s all be peaceful.” Lin Tian chuckled awkwardly. 
Landau wished he could spit on him, “Beast, do you even feel shame saying that?” 
The One-Eyed Owl heard this and grabbed Landau like a dead dog. 
Grugia asked, “Big Sis, what are you doing? We haven’t had enough of our revenge yet.” 
“It’s enough. Time to send him on his way. We’ll take out the rest of our anger on Alexander!” The One-Eyed Owl said as she began gathering strength in her right fist.  
You could hear the sound of her breath slicing through the air between her teeth! 
She flung Landau forward. 
Then immediately swung her right fist! 
“Swish!” 
A force so strong that it ignited the air itself shot out from her punch, the intense burst of energy cutting through like a razor, instantly reducing Landau to a mist of blood! 
He didn’t even have time to utter his last words. 
After that, the One-Eyed Owl looked into the distance, cracking her knuckles, “Let’s go, I can’t wait any longer!” 
… 
Twilight City. 
Due to its geographic location, as long as it didn’t rain, the city enjoyed a stunning sunset every day. 
It covered a vast area, stretching beyond what the eye could see, and housed five million people. 
A city with a legacy of nearly a thousand years. 
It had seen times of great glory and deep decline. 
But after Alexander discovered the fossils of an ancient Titan race and joined forces with alchemists and mages to create the Titanification Magic Array— 
The city entered an era of unprecedented prosperity. 
What was once an ordinary empire developed into a great empire in just twenty years. 
It also became famous for a particular delicacy, the ‘Roasted Gommos Giant Worm,’ a dish with a unique flavor that people either loved or hated. 
Early this morning. 
The people of Twilight City began their day as usual, busy with their routines. 
A middle-aged man staggered down from a stone building, bought a roasted worm from a breakfast stall, paired it with sour berry jam, and washed it down with a glass of milk. 
His unique, dark culinary choice shocked countless passersby. 
“Ha, what a fuss. You poor souls who’ve never tasted anything good, better try it while you’re still alive.” The middle-aged man grumbled, savoring the meal before heading back to take a nap. 
But suddenly. 
His expression shifted slightly as he looked into the distance at the sky, “Hmm? Wasn’t the sun just out? Why is it gone now? I was planning to have another worm this afternoon and watch the sunset.” 
With that, he returned upstairs to sleep. 
However, the noise from downstairs kept him awake, growing louder and more chaotic until he couldn’t stand it anymore. 
He couldn’t help but push open the window and shout, “You bunch of uncivilized brutes! Quiet down…!” 
But as he took in the scene outside, his expression froze. 
A massive crowd of residents was rushing madly in one direction, like a flood breaking through a dam. 
Their faces were filled with terror. 
“Run!” 
“What the hell is happening? Why are there so many dragons in the sky!?” 
“Who cares, just run! I heard a few million monsters are attacking!” 
Hearing the panicked voices of the passersby, the middle-aged man felt a deep sense of foreboding. He turned his head to look. 
A giant dragon, pure white and smooth all over, was swooping down with its wings spread wide! 
Its body crackled with blinding lightning. 
“Zzzzzz!” 
The middle-aged man’s eyes widened, “Fuck…” 
In an instant, the entire area became a sea of lightning, turning everything to ash. 
Countless people were vaporized in agony! 
Behind Thunder Calamity, a large number of ancient dragons were the first to reach Twilight City. 
Then came the dwarves’ steel war machines, rumbling as they advanced! 
One after another, nitro bombs were dropped, and the eastern part of the city was on the brink of becoming ruins. 
But the residents of the southern, western, and northern districts managed to escape, seeking refuge in the shelters. 
Meanwhile. 
In the eastern city, all the prepared Titan Warriors activated the power of the Titan, with countless bolts of lightning descending upon them! 
The thunder was even broader and more dazzling than that of the dragon Thunder Calamity. 
Tens of thousands of ordinary Titan Warriors appeared, each about five to six meters tall—not as formidable as the Perfect Titan Warriors, but still an overwhelming force in a typical empire’s war. 
Unfortunately, they were nothing but toys in the hands of the ancient dragons. 
Faced with the solid all-metal city gate, Lin Tian couldn’t help but laugh, “What a joke, you made the gate out of metal, but you didn’t have enough material for the walls. How practical.” 
Indeed. 
The all-metal gate, a meter thick, could only be opened using a mechanism, but the walls were just made of stone. 
Bill shouted loudly, “Make way, make way! The war machine is coming!” 
“Boom, boom, boom…” 
The enormous war machine, with its sharp teeth, even started devouring the city gate. 
Moreover, this war machine could absorb the metal it ate, automatically repairing any damage it sustained. 
Lin Tian was surprised, “So, in the end, the real fool was me.” 
As the goblin army flooded into the city. 
The residents of the eastern district, who hadn’t managed to escape, fell into utter despair! 
Cries of fear and anguish quickly spread throughout the entire city. 
The desperate resistance of the Titan Warriors was like ants trying to shake a tree. 
Goblins and dwarves, using their small stature to their advantage, dodged the Titan Warriors’ attacks, jumping onto them. 
In no time, they had opened blood-soaked holes all over the Titan Warriors’ bodies. 
The warriors died instantly. 
Before long, the eastern district was completely overrun, with corpses strewn everywhere amidst the ruins. 
The stench of gunpowder and blood mingled together, carried by the wind to the other districts. 
The smell made the residents retch, the physical and psychological discomfort overwhelming them. 
Many nearly fainted. 
A middle-aged man in silver armor, with a sharp gaze, led his troops into the streets. 
He shouted around the entire southern city, “Hurry! Everyone must evacuate to the shelters in the northern or western districts! Don’t bring anything with you! Time is of the essence!” 
This man was the captain of the Southern District. 
The southern district had fifty thousand Titan Warriors and two hundred thousand elite soldiers. 
But now wasn’t the time to fight. 
The priority was to evacuate the residents and then unite the forces of the northern and western districts for a decisive battle in the southern district. 
They needed to minimize the city’s destruction and the loss of property. 
In the temporary council chamber. 
All the district captains, knight captains, lords, commanders, dukes, and nobles gathered. 
Each of them was anxious, frustrated, and filled with despair. 
“Captain! The enemy has about one or two million troops, including goblins, monsters, dwarves, and dragons. The situation is extremely unfavorable for us!” A scout rushed into the room, speaking anxiously. 
He was covered in blood, missing an arm, and his armor was in tatters. 
He was one of the few scouts who had escaped from the chaotic battlefield in the eastern city. 
Upon hearing this, the captain’s expression turned grim, “Damn it, Landau’s forces must have been wiped out. Even without Perfect Titan Warriors, no, even with them, we’d barely stand a chance!” 
“Who exactly… did the War Empire provoke to face such a massive and terrifying force? Why did they attack us so swiftly?!!!!” 
Others echoed his sentiment. 
They were filled with confusion and despair. 
The most terrifying thing wasn’t just the sheer size and complexity of Lin Tian’s forces. 
It was the speed of the attack. 
The magical barrier didn’t detect any magical fluctuations from teleportation points, as if such a massive army had suddenly appeared out of nowhere. 
This made it incredibly difficult to understand. 
Suddenly, the Southern District Captain had a moment of clarity, “It’s the Dragon Slayer Guild! They came from the direction of Dragon Slayer City, and because it’s an independent town, the magical barrier couldn’t detect any magical fluctuations from teleportation points!” 
Every great empire had magical barriers, not for defense, but for detection. 
They functioned like radars. 
These barriers could sense magical fluctuations from teleportation points set up after the barrier’s installation, preventing enemy troops from sneaking in. 
Previously, when Lin Tian was in the Great Tomb and wanted to set up a magical array in the snowy plains, he had reported it to Rebecca. 
“Damn it, I’ve said before that this potential threat should have been eradicated! And now, what are we supposed to do about Twilight City?” The Northern District Captain gritted his teeth in hatred. 
He was trembling with rage. 
The Southern District Captain sighed, “I have a feeling this attack is connected to the Dragon Slayer Guild. Perhaps the Landau family’s offense against them became the catalyst for their plan to destroy us!” 
“That’s right. I just received word from a scout that they spotted the shadow of the One-Eyed Owl…” The Western District Captain said gravely. 
A duke stood up, “Everyone, we need to stay calm. The Emperor isn’t here, so what we should be discussing is how to drive them back!” 
Alexander, along with several of the empire’s strongest warriors and world-class adventurers, had gone to raid a dungeon to defeat a Demon King. 
They hadn’t returned yet. 
Hearing the reports on Lin Tian’s forces had nearly paralyzed these people with fear. 
They didn’t dare think about defeating the enemy. 
If they could just repel them and stabilize the situation, it would already be a miracle.
