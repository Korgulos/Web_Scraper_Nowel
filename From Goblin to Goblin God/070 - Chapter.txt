Looking at Gobu Shan’s attribute panel, Lin Tian felt quite satisfied, though he didn’t expect that Gobu Shan was still slightly weaker than that guy, Gobu Kuang. 
After all, he was a mutant variant. 
Then he looked at Gobu Tian, who resembled a little cockroach.

Lin Tian hadn’t expected Gobu Tian’s attributes to be inferior, yet his overall strength matched Gobu Shan’s. 
It was likely because the combat power of those leaning towards an assassin role tended to be higher. 
If equipped with various gear, he might even be stronger. 
Lost in thought, Lin Tian was brought back by an angry, delicate voice. 
“Let go of me, you damn goblins! I’m the lord’s wife! How dare you capture me! I’ll have the lord kill you and avenge my child. None of you will escape!” 
The knocked-out female iguana had awakened and was shouting incessantly. 
Lin Tian was somewhat bewildered and asked, “Who is this? Lord? Where did you capture this iguana from?” 
“We don’t know. We just ran into this iguana tribe while walking.” 
Gobu Kuang scratched his head and said. 
Then he chuckled, “Boss, we caught them just for you. One young, one mature, depending on your taste.” 
“Ahem, I generally adhere to the principle of wanting them all. But, is this damned iguana part of that Iguana Lord’s tribe?” 
Lin Tian’s expression turned serious. 
Seeing that he seemed a bit scared, the female iguana triumphantly said, “That’s right, my husband is the Southern Lord! Now that you know fear, it’s too late. I won’t let you off!” 
However, Lin Tian’s expression turned into an evil smile. 
His facial features twisted. 
He had been holding back his anger, and now it was time to vent it. 
Moreover, this iguana was quite beautiful. 
“Iguana Lord? Want to split my tribe? Want to kill me? Then don’t blame me for being rude~” 
Lin Tian reached out, slowly approaching the female iguana. 
Seeing this, the female iguana was utterly panicked, struggling to break free from Gobu Kuang’s grip, “Don’t move, lady. You wouldn’t want your husband to die, would you? As long as you let me vent enough…” 
As he spoke, a poison arrow from an Elemental Hand Crossbow was shot over. 
Not long after, the female iguana became like a puppet with its strings cut, collapsing to the ground. 
“No, I am the lord’s wife! To be violated by goblins, by goblins…” 
The female iguana cried, her body out of control. 
She was being used at will. 
An hour later, Lin Tian sighed, “Goodness, no wonder that guy next door liked iguanas so much. Didn’t expect there to be something to it.” 
Then, he looked at the smaller iguana. 
He didn’t let it go either, venting all his anger toward the Iguana Lord on his family. 
“What did you two do to his tribe? Just captured these two?” 
Lin Tian lay on the ground, feeling a bit tired, and asked. 
Gobu Tian explained, “No, we mostly slaughtered and devoured them, leaving a few alive to reproduce.” 
Hearing this, Lin Tian jumped up in shock, not expecting these three guys to take advantage of the Iguana Lord’s absence and ransack his home. 
Gobu Kuang and the others were nervous, thinking they would be scolded, but Lin Tian excitedly said, “Well done! Especially you, Gobu Kuang. I didn’t raise you for nothing; you even brought something fun back to honor me.” 
Now, he just wanted to see how that guy would react when he found out who the real culprit was. 
Speaking of the devil, he appeared. 
“Damn goblins! Get out here!! Give me back my wife and daughter!!!” 
Outside the Tian Kuang Tribe, the Iguana Lord tracked the scent to this place. 
He never expected it to be the Tian Kuang Tribe that did it! 
They had just torn each other’s faces, and in such a short time, they had massacred his tribe. 
He couldn’t tolerate it! 
The Iguana Lord charged in, breaking down the door and swinging his tail, killing a few big variants. Coldly, he said, “Today, I won’t leave a single one of your tribe alive! Blood for blood!” 
Roaring, he saw his wife and daughter on the ground. 
He looked as if struck by lightning. 
Immediately, he froze! 
“Oh, what a coincidence. I just finished. If you want to leave now, I might let you go. If you don’t, then… you’ll die…” 
Lin Tian said, his smile wicked and cold. 
The Iguana Lord was furious, but he first asked, “Wife, daughter, are you alright? Did these low-level monsters do anything to you?” 
“Hu-Husband, I feel great now, even better than before. You should leave; I want to stay here…” 
The female iguana’s words struck like a bolt from the blue. 
The blush on her face, her warm breath, and that look of longing and attachment. 
It was as if a needle pierced the Iguana Lord’s heart. 
He understood the implication of her words! 
A double blow to his dignity and body! 
Even his daughter said coquettishly, “Dad, I’ll stay here with Mom. I’ll take good care of him.” 
As she spoke, she snuggled up to Lin Tian, like a pet. 
These scenes were completely unacceptable to the Iguana Lord, making him feel like today was surreal! 
Not a dream but a nightmare! 
His tribe was slaughtered, leaving only a few survivors, and his wife and daughter were… 
“I’ll kill all of you! Especially you!” 
The Iguana Lord gritted his teeth until they bled and suddenly launched an attack! 
His speed was immense, smashing large sections of the rock underfoot. 
Seeing him approach, Gobu Kuang directly blocked in front. Even though he was using magic now, his strength hadn’t diminished. 
He forcefully engaged the Iguana Lord, and both were pushed back. 
“How is this possible, a mere leader variant actually…” 
The Iguana Lord couldn’t believe it, looking at Gobu Kuang in astonishment. 
At this moment, Lin Tian gestured for them to stop, “Since this guy wants to die, I’ll take care of him. I’ve wanted to kill him for a long time anyway.” 
Killing him would mean becoming the new Southern Lord. 
At worst, he’d send Gobu Shan or Brutal over to take the position; he didn’t necessarily have to do it himself. 
But killing him would truly relieve his anger! 
Although he had already vented everything on the mother-daughter iguana pair. 
The Iguana Lord was furious, wanting to summon monsters but realized this was the east, not under his jurisdiction. 
He coldly snorted, “Even without other monsters, I can still kill you! Necrotic Cells!” 
As he spoke, he rapidly approached Lin Tian, drooling thick, black-green saliva. 
He spat it madly at Lin Tian. 
This saliva contained numerous bacteria, at least a billion in a single drop. 
In a world without antibiotics, if it contaminated the skin, the entire body would be consumed by bacteria within three days. 
Bathing, burning, freezing, none of it worked. 
The bacteria couldn’t be cleaned off. 
Even one would rapidly multiply. 
Lin Tian directly used the skill Brutal Roar, roaring to shatter all the saliva with sound waves. 
Not a drop touched him. 
The Iguana Lord, completely unprepared, stood there in a daze, his eyes rolling back. 
Seizing the opportunity, Lin Tian quickly approached, stabbing a dagger towards his heart. 
The blade only managed to scratch the scales. 
With quick reflexes, Lin Tian delivered another stab! 
This time, it pierced the skin deeply, and blood gushed out like a fountain, spraying everywhere! 
Undoubtedly, it hit the heart! 
The intense pain brought the Iguana Lord back to his senses, and he quickly retreated, “Damn goblin! What was that just now? I lost consciousness!” 
He clutched his chest, where blood was gushing. 
One second, two seconds, three seconds. 
When he removed his hand, the shocking wound had healed! 
Gobu Tian and the others were surprised. 
But Lin Tian had expected this, “Hmph, super recovery, but you can only recover once.” 
It was similar to a gecko’s tail regeneration. 
This species had strong regenerative abilities. 
The iguana tribe could even survive one fatal injury. 
The Iguana Lord gritted his teeth, saying, “But I won’t give you a second chance, Hormone Growth!” 
In the next second, his body began to grow larger. 
He grew to over five meters tall! 
His muscles bulged like stones glued to his body, and those tiny scales turned into dazzling golden armor. 
Covering his entire body. 
The Iguana Lord felt immensely confident, “Strength! Endless strength! What will you use to fight me?” 
Finished, he prepared to go all out! 
A thin, white membrane even covered his eyes. 
Now, he was practically invincible! 
Every inch of him had extremely high defense; the only unprotected part was under his tail, but it was impossible to attack it. 
Gobu Kuang and the others showed extreme caution in their expressions. 
Especially Gobu Tian, whose premonition told him this guy was dangerous. 
Lin Tian also felt some pressure and prepared to use earth elements to slow him down. 
He intended to get the blood of decay into his body, which would turn him impotent. 
“Swish!” 
At this moment, a rusty longsword pierced through the Iguana Lord’s back! Blood spurted out again! 
Everyone’s eyes widened, not knowing who did it! 
That poor-quality longsword was a weapon used by big goblins. 
Even if Lin Tian had a fine longsword, he couldn’t guarantee breaking through the Iguana Lord’s armor. 
“You! Who are you! Birdman? No, let me see…” 
The Iguana Lord, choking on blood, tried to turn his head to see who had ambushed him. 
But suddenly, the sword in his abdomen moved! 
“Slash!” 
In the next second! 
The longsword sliced through the Iguana Lord like cutting a cake!  
From bottom to top, it cut him in half!
