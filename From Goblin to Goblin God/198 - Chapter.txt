Chapter 198: A Demon King-Level Summon! 
TL: Sungmin 
At this moment. 
Osius, Grugia, and the others finally found an opportunity to climb over. 
“Big Sis!” 
They had been quite worried, but when they looked around, the scene before them was nothing like they had imagined. 
The ground was littered with gruesome corpses. 
And Luna lay on the ground, groaning in pain. 
The One-Eyed Owl suddenly turned her gaze toward them, her eyes in the dark—one glowing with a colorful light, the other as crimson as a wild beast’s! 
It was terrifying! 
The members of the Dragon Slayer Guild were so frightened that their hair stood on end! They quickly backed away, “Big Sis, don’t be impulsive, it’s us!” 
“Yes, it’s your own people!” 
“What happened here? Everyone’s dead?! When did Big Sis become this powerful?” 
Although they always thought the One-Eyed Owl was strong, this was a group of Holy Tree Warriors. 
For her to have wiped them all out in such a short time was truly unexpected. 
Osius suddenly noticed something, “Look, Big Sis is wearing weaponized gauntlets. She finally decided to use weapons.” 
The others suddenly understood. 
The One-Eyed Owl had almost lost control and attacked them earlier. 
She was extremely frustrated, “It wasn’t satisfying at all!” 
As she spoke, she took out the super recovery potion that Lin Tian had distributed to treat her injuries first. 
Otherwise, she would have lost too much blood. 
Thanks to the Serpentfolk responsible for brewing the potions, they had plenty in reserve. 
“Sister Luna!” 
At this moment, the Tree Spirit in the air finally noticed that everyone had died. It had been so focused on restraining the dragon that it hadn’t noticed. 
The corners of the One-Eyed Owl’s mouth curled up again, “I almost forgot, there’s still someone here who can let me have some fun.” 
The Tree Spirit ignored her. 
Instead, it activated its skill, “Holy Tree Magic: Universal Revival! Arise, warriors of the tree!” 
On the ground, a magic circle formed, and a large amount of green light began to shine. 
Through the roots of the World Tree, it started to reconstruct the bodies of the fallen Holy Tree Warriors! 
It was somewhat similar to what the Violet-Gold Dragon Mother had done before. 
Soon. 
They all stood up again. 
However, this greatly depleted the Tree Spirit’s power, and it could no longer maintain control over the vines, falling weakly to the ground. 
Luna quickly shielded it and moved it to the back to rest, “Lord Tree Spirit, thank you for your grace. We will complete the task and bring you back!” 
With that said. 
The Holy Tree Warriors began to move again! 
And their strength had become even greater. 
This time, the One-Eyed Owl couldn’t kill her opponents with a single punch and could only suppress three at most. 
But the remaining six or seven were still tough for the Dragon Slayer Guild to handle. 
Overall, the strength of these Holy Tree Warriors was now close to ten thousand! 
After just a few moves, Grugia was already seriously injured and had to activate Titanification to barely cope. 
Luna couldn’t help but gloat, “Weren’t you so tough before? Why does it seem like you’re struggling now?” 
“Hmph, I prefer a challenge, something that keeps me continuously entertained, not something that ends in just a few seconds!” The One-Eyed Owl replied. 
But it was clear that the members of the Dragon Slayer Guild were starting to feel overwhelmed. 
After all, the Tree Spirit had sacrificed all its magic power to resurrect and enhance them. 
Even though Osius was wielding a world-class magic tool, his proficiency was low, and it was just a sharp sword in his hands. 
He had no real sword skills to speak of. 
Sweat was pouring down his face, “Big Sis, we’re almost…” 
Suddenly, his words were cut off. 
They saw a familiar figure approaching from a distance—Lin Tian! 
“That guy isn’t dead? That’s great!” 
Grugia, covered in wounds and a bloody mess, reverted to his original form and retreated behind the others. 
On the plaza, Lin Tian quietly approached the weakened Tree Spirit. 
Sara followed behind him, her expression complicated. 
It was clear that the Tree Spirit was in serious danger this time, but since she needed Lin Tian to regain her status, she didn’t dare say anything. 
Lin Tian wore a wicked smile as he walked up behind the Tree Spirit, and using the system, he could see that her combat power was only a little over two thousand—extremely weak. 
He grabbed her by the neck and lifted her up. 
“Kekekeke, everyone, stop right now!” 
His threatening voice echoed across the plaza. 
Luna and the others quickly looked over and were all dumbfounded, “A Goblin?! How could you still be alive? Princess Sara?! What… what’s going on?!” 
“Wait, why is Sara there?! This can’t be!” 
“Did Sara fail? No, why is she standing behind the Goblin?!” 
“This isn’t good; Lord Tree Spirit is in danger!” 
Facing this situation, Luna continued to question, “Princess Sara! Can you explain this?!” 
“Explain, huh…” 
“Buzz!” 
In the sky, clouds swirled, obscuring the moon! 
On the ground, several blue magic circles formed, accompanied by the sound of rushing water. 
“Ultimate Summoning Magic · King of the Nile!” 
Immediately, Sara activated her power, summoning a massive humanoid crocodile with a grotesque face and sharp teeth! 
It wielded a long fishbone bayonet. 
The beast’s oppressive aura flooded the area, making it hard to breathe! 
The One-Eyed Owl’s pupils contracted, and her instincts told her that fighting this creature would result in death. 
Luna’s expression was complicated, “You’ve even summoned a Demon King-level creature, Princess Sara, so why haven’t you attacked yet?” 
“Surrender immediately. I don’t want to fight you all…” 
Sara said heavily, unable to offer any further explanation. 
Upon hearing this. 
The Holy Tree Warriors were all stunned, “What?!” 
Luna’s heart trembled with disbelief, “Impossible, Princess Sara! Are you betraying us, betraying the Troy Empire?! How could you possibly side with the Goblins? This… this can’t be happening!” 
Given the nature of the Trojans. 
Even in death, they would never surrender or betray their people! 
Especially someone of princess rank! 
“What happened? How did the Goblin manage to win over the honorable Princess Sara?! Why?!” 
Luna and her comrades were already in despair. 
With Sara aiding the Goblins, they had no chance of victory. 
Lin Tian continued his threat, “It seems you won’t surrender? Then I’ll just kill her first…” 
“Wait! If we surrender, will you spare Lord Tree Spirit?” Luna hurriedly asked, her face full of worry. 
The Tree Spirit’s expression was one of intense pain, as it had no strength left to resist while being strangled. 
Lin Tian narrowed his eyes, “Sure, but you all must cripple your own powers—essentially, commit suicide.” 
“What?! Is that even considered surrender?” 
“Goblin, you’ve certainly won, and your methods are beyond our expectations, but isn’t this too much?” 
“If you dare harm the Tree Spirit, the Holy Tree Empire will never let you go!” 
Luna added, “Let’s end this now. From now on, our two nations will never interfere with each other, alright?” 
“Are you trying to negotiate with me? Or are you threatening me? When I walked out of that filthy, vengeful lowly tribe, I grew up with threats! That doesn’t work on me!” Lin Tian said coldly. 
His resolute tone left the Holy Tree Warriors at a loss. 
Immediately. 
Two warriors stepped forward, “Fine, if we end our lives, we hope you’ll spare Lord Tree Spirit. She is, after all, the embodiment of the Holy Tree that protects all life…” 
“Alright, but you all must end your lives.” 
Lin Tian’s lips curled into a contemptuous smile. 
Luna gritted her teeth and stepped forward, then looked at the others, “What are you all waiting for? We’ve already betrayed Lord Tree Spirit before. Now, to revive you, Lord Tree Spirit has sacrificed all her power. Your lives and everything else were given by her, so isn’t it right to give them back?” 
At this moment. 
Even the self-serving Holy Tree Warriors who craved glory and status were moved. 
“Indeed, I owe Lord Tree Spirit too much; today, I will repay it!” 
“Commander, I apologize for what happened that day!” 
“Death is death. After all, we’ve already died once. As long as Lord Tree Spirit can survive…” 
And so, 
All the Holy Tree Warriors chose to end their lives. 
But Luna’s expression hardened as she questioned, “How can I trust you? What if we choose to end our lives and you still don’t spare Lord Tree Spirit?” 
“Hmph, do you think you have any other options? Besides, I’m the leader of a nation; my word is my bond.” Lin Tian said seriously. 
Seeing this. 
Luna and the others had no other choice. 
They each took their Holy Tree spears and aimed them at their hearts. 
Nearby, Osius and Grugia couldn’t help but whisper to each other, “So naive. They don’t understand how sinister people can be, or just how devious Lin Tian really is!” 
“Yeah, they could at least try to resist. If they gave it their all, at least one person might be able to escape.” 
Gripping the spear shafts. 
The hands of the Holy Tree Warriors trembled! 
They were desperately gulping down air, but it felt like they weren’t taking in any oxygen at all. 
This was the suffocating feeling of despair and fear. 
Puchi! 
Suddenly, Luna made the first move. The spear pierced through her body, emerging from her back with a trace of blood on its tip. 
Her face twisted in pain as she collapsed to the ground, her mouth open, trying to say something, but no words came out. 
This kind of sharp weapon piercing the heart would take a while to kill her. 
The best method would have been to pierce through the skull. 
With great difficulty, Luna raised her head and looked at Lin Tian, “Quick… quickly release Lord Tree Spirit.” 
Seeing that they had all fallen. 
Lin Tian let out a cold laugh. Osius and the others didn’t need to think to know that this was the moment when people would learn just how cruel the world could be. 
However, Lin Tian actually reached out and lowered the Tree Spirit. 
“Huh? Brother Tian, what’s going on? Is this really you?” 
At this moment, both Osius and Grugia were stunned. 
He actually kept his promise?! 
Seeing this, Luna and the others finally felt relieved, their bodies writhing in pain as they awaited death. 
After an unknown amount of time, Luna, drifting in and out of consciousness from the pain, glanced forward. 
And that single glance nearly made her leap to her feet in shock! 
Lin Tian was furiously devouring the Tree Spirit’s head. 
Because the Tree Spirit’s body was formed from magic, even though half of its head had been devoured, it continued to move, struggling incessantly. 
It was in unbearable pain! 
“You! Stop this at once! Damn Goblin, don’t do this! Didn’t you promise to spare the Tree Spirit…?” 
Before Luna could finish her sentence, she coughed up several mouthfuls of blood. 
Her consciousness began to blur. 
Lin Tian sneered, “Didn’t I just let her go? She got caught again—how careless of her.” 
Upon hearing this. 
Rage and helplessness filled their hearts! 
“You beast, Goblin! Even as a ghost, I won’t let you off!” 
“Stop it! Stop it!” 
“Aaah!” 
In the midst of pain and despair, all the Holy Tree Warriors died. 
Lin Tian continued to devour the Tree Spirit, noting through the system that she was a member of the ‘Divine Race.’ 
Although he wasn’t sure if she could be considered a true god, eating her was certainly better than letting her go. 
After all, she was at least a demigod. 
If he devoured ten more, he could evolve. 
Sara, standing nearby, couldn’t help but feel a sense of dread. This goblin was too terrifying. She had thought she could crush him, but every step, every move, had been under his control. 
There was no way to beat him! 
Now, all she could do was obediently follow orders, hoping to regain her honor someday. 
“Ding, congratulations on obtaining a new title! Path of Evolution (1): Devourer of Gods!” 
Oh? 
Lin Tian quickly checked. It seemed that he could indeed evolve by devouring gods. 
This was amazing! He had thought Joan of Arc would be the first, but here he had gotten one for free! 
“Boom!” 
At that moment. 
In the distance, over the residential area, a massive fire dragon soared into the sky, covering the heavens! 
Everyone quickly turned to look—it was the Flame Dragon Mother. 
The One-Eyed Owl, unable to contain her excitement, exclaimed, “I almost forgot that the battle over there isn’t over yet! I’m starving for more!” 
With that, she rushed toward the scene. 
Lin Tian looked at Sara, “Over there, those should be your people, right? You know what you need to do, don’t you?” 
“Understood, Your Majesty Goblin…” 
Sara’s expression was complex. 
These Trojan heroes were her loyal subordinates. 
But if they found out what had happened between her and the Goblin, they would undoubtedly kill her for tarnishing Troy’s honor. 
She had to take them out. 
She then followed the others, heading toward the battle. 
At this moment, Alice and Gobu Kuang were engaged in a fierce fight against ten Trojan heroes! 
These warriors possessed unimaginable strength. 
With the power of heroes, they not only ignored control effects but also suppressed the strength of their opponents. 
The key factor was the tenfold suppression!
