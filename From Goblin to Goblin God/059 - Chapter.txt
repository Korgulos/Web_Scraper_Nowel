Chapter 59: Ultimate Skill · Holy Judgment 
TL: Sungmin  
Seeing her disheveled clothes and the foul-smelling objects scattered on the ground, Alicenia understood. It was that goblin! The one they hadn’t managed to kill! 
“Splurt!” 
While she was thinking, Emma directly plunged a knife into her own heart! 
Tears streaming down her face, she said, “Lady Alicenia, I don’t want to give birth to a goblin’s child. You must avenge us…” 
With that, she fell to the ground, dying with her eyes open. 
Alicenia’s face darkened, almost dripping with anger. She was beyond furious! 
It was now hatred, malice, terror! 
From afar, Big Bull Li controlled three tentacles, smashing them towards her! 
Alicenia spun around! 
Sword Qi slashed horizontally! 
Not only did it cut off the three tentacles, but the flying Sword Qi also severed everything in front of her over three meters high! 
Several minotaurs suddenly froze, half their bodies slowly sliding off and falling to the ground. 
Everyone was scared by the sudden scene! 
They couldn’t help but step back several paces. 
Even the humans like Felomon. 
Big Bull Li also sensed that the situation wasn’t good. Even if he activated his demonic transformation, he might not be able to win. 
For the minotaur tribe, every demonic transformation cost them a tentacle. 
Big Bull Li originally had ten tails, now he was down to six, having used four. 
If he lost all his tails, it would mean death. 
This time, transforming was risking his life. 
Seeing this, the other minotaurs activated their demonic transformation! 
Most of them could only activate it three times in their lives, and they had to go all out this time, or they would all die! 
In the demonic transformation state, not only did their attributes increase explosively, but they could also use their tentacles for long-range attacks. 
A hard, armor-like substance would appear on their bodies, very tough. 
“You all must die…” 
Alicenia’s face remained dark, coldly uttering these words. 
“Ultimate Sword Skill · Holy Judgment!” 
She suddenly plunged her longsword into her own body! 
Everyone was stunned! 
Felomon, shocked and worried, exclaimed, “Lady Sword Saintess, what are you doing!” 
Alicenia replied indifferently, “All of you, leave here immediately, or you will all die…” 
“Damn!” 
“Run, run!” 
“I’ve never seen Lady Sword Saintess so terrifying!” 
“Mother, she’s scarier than those monsters!” 
A group of people started to flee. 
Hiding, Lin Tian also felt something was wrong and quickly fled as well. 
At this moment, the longsword plunged into Alicenia’s body burst out with a blinding light! 
Several tentacles near her were instantly evaporated by the light. 
“Rumble, rumble!” 
Within the Bright Town area, the ground continued to shake! 
A giant golden magic circle covered the entire ground of Bright Town! 
Countless holy runes spun around. 
Alicenia slowly began to float upwards, then a golden statue emerged from the ground! 
About ten meters high. 
It bore some resemblance to Alicenia. 
It even felt like a 1:10 replica. 
However, the statue’s eyes were covered. 
The terrifyingly holy aura was so intense that no one dared to look directly at those eyes, even if they weren’t covered! 
Alicenia’s eyes were now emitting a strong golden light. 
She made a motion of reaching out to the right, and the statue mimicked her. 
But in the statue’s hand, there was a giant sword formed of holy light. 
It was clear that Alicenia controlled the statue. 
Immediately, the statue began to move! 
The entire world seemed to tremble! 
With one strike, like squashing an ant, it obliterated a minotaur in demonic form! 
One was so scared he was stunned. The giant sword landed nearby, and the air wave it stirred up sent him flying! 
He quickly tried to escape. 
But when he reached the edge of the magic circle on the ground, the holy runes appeared, knocking him back. 
The damage was high too. 
His arm looked like it was burned, sizzling and smoking. 
Alicenia slaughtered wildly, no minotaur could withstand a single strike. 
Soon, only Big Bull Li was left. 
Outside, Lin Tian felt incredibly fortunate, “Damn, luckily I ran out. This guy I thought was a swordsman turns out to be a mage??? A pure close-combat mad dog mage!” 
The destructive power of such a holy statue puppet was unimaginable. 
Checking through the system, Alicenia’s overall combat power had soared to five thousand! 
Four thousand wasn’t even her limit. 
“Is it worth fighting like this, as if your lives depended on it?” 
Lin Tian remarked, observing that earlier, both the elf and the minotaurs fought fiercely, and now even the Sword Saintess was going all out. 
It was terrifying. 
On the other side, Felomon and the others watched this scene with tears of excitement, “Lady Sword Saintess is so powerful!” 
“Do you understand what a sense of security is? This is it!” 
“Long live Lady Sword Saintess! I’m now a fan!” 
“I’m totally a super fan! My goddess is amazing! Kill that big monster!” 
At this moment, Big Bull Li’s face showed signs of fear. One of his horns had been cut off. His aura was weak, completely devoid of the arrogance he had earlier.  
The attacks from the holy statue grew increasingly stronger! 
Big Bull Li hurriedly used several tentacles to bind the statue’s hands, feet, waist, and neck. 
A struggle for strength began! 
The muscles in the tentacles creaked under tension, and Alicenia, who was controlling the statue, also appeared to be struggling, unable to break free. 
It had to be said, no matter how powerful a woman was, she had no resistance against tentacles. 
Seeing this made Lin Tian want to learn this ability. 
The minotaur opened its huge mouth, revealing a tubular appendage hidden inside! 
It was very long, surrounded by sharp teeth, extremely frightening. 
It lunged towards the Sword Saintess’s body, like a chameleon or a frog extending its long tongue. 
Big Bull Li sneered, thinking he had succeeded, and so did everyone else. 
In an instant, the sword embedded in the Sword Saintess’s body flew out, piercing straight towards Big Bull Li’s appendage! 
It directly pierced into Big Bull Li’s mouth! 
Holy light spewed out from his mouth, like flames, it was shocking! 
Immediately after, the holy statue broke free from its restraints. 
It stabbed Big Bull Li’s abdomen again, pinning him to the ground. 
It was clear that his strength was gone. 
Felomon and the others finally felt relieved, “As expected of the undefeated Sword Saintess, the unyielding holy sword protecting the empire… too powerful…” 
Big Bull Li was completely suppressed, unable to resist. 
The holy sword inside him erupted with golden light, frantically destroying his internal organs! 
In addition to the sword pierced in his mouth. 
Finally, 
Big Bull Li gradually lost the ability to resist and died on the spot. 
At this moment, the holy statue staggered, almost losing its balance. 
Alicenia was also barely holding on, blood seeping from the sword wound in her abdomen, staining her platinum armor. 
As the statue disappeared, she fell from mid-air. 
Seeing this, Felomon and the others knew it was bad and rushed over to check on her. 
Alicenia stood up with eyes full of sorrow, not fainting, clutching her abdomen. 
Looking at Big Bull Li’s corpse, she felt no joy, three comrades who shared life and death were gone just like that. 
And the culprit was still alive! 
She picked up her weapon, used a recovery potion to suppress the wound, and prepared to find Lin Tian. 
“Boom!” 
A wind ball blasted towards the Sword Saintess. 
Injured and exhausted, the Sword Saintess couldn’t react, flying dozens of meters away! 
Parts of her armor fell off, and her holy sword slipped from her hand. 
“It’s that goblin! You despicable, shameless creature, attacking Lady Sword Saintess while she’s injured!” Felomon shouted angrily. 
Lin Tian looked at him in surprise, “What did you just call me?” 
“Despicable, shameless creature!” Felomon said hatefully. 
Lin Tian shrugged, “Not that, the previous sentence, you know I’m a goblin, and you’re still reasoning with me?” 
“Swish!” 
The Elemental Hand Crossbow shot out! 
It hit Felomon right between the eyes, sticky blood oozing from the wound, and he fell to the ground. 
Lin Tian didn’t bother arguing with him. 
But now, the plan to capture the leader first was no longer effective. 
The soldiers’ morale shifted to the Sword Saintess; Felomon’s death made them furious! 
They all charged at Lin Tian with their weapons. 
There were over three hundred soldiers, the most troublesome being the lancers. 
However, Lin Tian could handle it, moving swiftly among the soldiers! 
They couldn’t catch his position. 
Every time he moved, a soldier would be decapitated, or have a bloody hole in his chest. 
Thanks to Lin Tian’s small stature, his speed had great advantages. 
It was a one-sided slaughter. 
The ruins echoed with the soldiers’ wails. 
“Don’t retreat! Buy time for Lady Sword Saintess to recover!” 
“Sacrifice your hearts!” 
An experienced soldier shouted passionately. 
Suddenly, the shout stopped. 
He looked down to find Lin Tian standing in front of him, holding a heart, “Well, you’re free, I’ll take this heart.” 
Nearby, Alicenia struggled to move, healing her injuries. 
She felt anger, helplessness, despair, guilt. 
Watching her soldiers die for her, unable to help them. 
The painful wails were like a demon’s whisper in her ear. 
Alicenia, regaining some strength, drank several vials of stamina potion. 
She picked up her holy sword and stood up. 
Her strength wasn’t fully restored, only around 2500. 
“It’s enough, I will kill you now!” 
Alicenia moved instantly, slashing towards Lin Tian! 
Sword Qi surged wildly! 
It was unavoidable. 
Lin Tian’s keen skills sensed the attack, he quickly used a near-death soldier as a shield. 
Alicenia’s heart tightened, she redirected her sword, slashing to the side. 
“Boom!” 
A ten-meter fissure appeared in front of her! 
The sight was terrifying.
