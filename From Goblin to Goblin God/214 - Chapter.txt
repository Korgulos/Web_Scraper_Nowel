Chapter 214: Endless Form, Tempered Flesh? 
TL: Sungmin  
It seemed like taking down these Trojan War Gods wouldn’t be easy. 
“Muhammad Sara, I am here today to take your life. You will pay for what you’ve done! Do you have any last words?” 
The old man’s voice boomed with grandeur! 
It resounded like a great bell. 
His aura swept over like a vast wave, overwhelming everything. 
With his hands clasped together, he advanced step by step like an old monk. 
Lin Tian had no desire to fight these guys for Sara, but their target wasn’t just Sara. 
They were after him as well. 
He had no choice but to find a way to take them down. 
“I’ll handle the golden divine ornaments, you summon the Crocodile Demon King first,” Lin Tian said seriously. 
He didn’t rely solely on brute force to solve problems, unless the opponent was weaker. 
That way, victory was certain. 
But now, he had to use his brain. 
With his current ability, a direct fight wouldn’t work—there was a difference between his 13,000 combat power and the old man’s 16,000. 
However, if he could steal the golden divine ornaments from the old man, the Crocodile Demon King could join the battle. 
Then victory would be within reach. 
Gamus sneered disdainfully, “Foolish! It’s fine if a goblin doesn’t know, but even you don’t? Ancient Trojan creatures cannot attack someone wearing the golden divine ornaments. You must be as dumb as a goblin!” 
He spoke with anger. 
Lin Tian quickly replied, “Then you’d better be careful not to let someone steal the golden divine ornaments!” 
Hearing this, Gamus immediately looked around nervously, only relaxing when he saw no one nearby. 
But that very action showed that his emotions were fixated on the golden divine ornaments. 
“Lucky Steal!” 
In an instant, a flash of light appeared in Lin Tian’s hand! 
A golden, glittering ornament materialized in his palm! 
Lin Tian raised an eyebrow—it seemed he had discovered another exploit of Lucky Steal! 
To steal something, just verbally remind the opponent. 
This actually increased the chances of success. 
Because Lucky Steal had a high probability of snatching items the opponent was emotionally attached to. 
It wasn’t just some random pickpocket skill or simple money-stealing ability. 
Gamus was dumbfounded on the spot, “What just happened?! You despicable, shameless Goblin! Looks like I’ll have to kill you first! Endless Form!!” 
He roared, and veins bulged all over his body! 
His once thin frame rapidly swelled with muscle, transforming him in mere seconds from a frail old man into a hulking beast! 
His breathing became deep and thunderous, like a raging ox! 
His eyes, glowing eerily like ghost fire, locked onto Lin Tian, and with a single step, the floor shattered beneath him! 
He accelerated to 100 kilometers per hour in less than a second! 
“Death’s Embrace!” 
With his massive, muscular arms, he reached out to crush Lin Tian in a devastating hug. 
That pressure alone— 
Any normal person would have been scared to wet themselves on the spot! 
But Lin Tian, having faced countless storms, remained calm, “So this is what it means for an 80-year-old veteran to apply for battle? But you chose the wrong target!” 
He immediately dodged to the side. 
Because of his small stature, his reduced hitbox allowed him to easily evade the attack. 
“What!” 
Suddenly! 
Lin Tian’s pupils contracted—the reaction speed of this old monster was eerily similar to a premonition! 
Just as Lin Tian dodged, Gamus pivoted and threw a punch! 
“Boom!!” 
The ground exploded as if hit by artillery! 
The deafening sound echoed out! 
Cracks spread out for hundreds of meters like a spider web! 
Dust filled the air! 
The impact wave violently flung Lin Tian backward. 
But before he could land! 
Through the hazy dust, Lin Tian saw those eerie, ghostly eyes already locked onto him! 
Seeing this. 
Lin Tian’s adrenaline surged wildly, “Prepare to strike!” 
“Roar!” 
In an instant, he unleashed a super-powered Ruinous Howl, rattling Gamus’ mind and momentarily stunning him. 
If it had been an ordinary Ruinous Howl, it wouldn’t have worked. 
But beside him, Gobu Kuang and the others were fighting fiercely too, having already activated the Royal Domain. 
This amplified all of the goblins’ skills. 
Of course, it didn’t work on humans or other species, even if they were allies. 
In the brief moment Gamus was stunned. 
A massive crocodile leaped over, its jaws clamping down on his arm! 
The sharp pain snapped Gamus back to reality, “Damn you, get off me, you damned reptile!” 
The Crocodile Demon King, with its usually devastating bite force that could tear humans to pieces, now only inflicted superficial wounds, causing some blood to spill but failing to break the bone. 
From a distance, Sara shouted, “King of the Nile, Death Roll!” 
“Swish swish swish!” 
The five-meter-long, multi-ton Crocodile Demon King began to spin wildly! 
A loud “crack” echoed through the air! 
Gamus’ left arm broke with the sound, completely torn from his body, exposing gleaming white bone! 
Blood sprayed everywhere! 
The intense pain made Gamus gasp sharply, “You’ve forced my hand!” 
Like a madman, he rushed at the Crocodile Demon King, engaging it in fierce battle! 
The Crocodile Demon King had a combat power of 15,000, while Gamus had 16,000. Logic would dictate that Gamus’ strength should have diminished due to his injury. 
But unexpectedly. 
He grabbed the broken bone of his severed arm and used it as a blade, stabbing it savagely into the Crocodile Demon King’s stomach! 
“Die, you filthy reptile!!!” Gamus roared hysterically, veins bulging all over his body. 
His broken arm twisted inside the crocodile’s stomach, ripping out a mass of internal organs! 
The Crocodile Demon King died instantly! 
It turned to ash and disappeared from the field. 
Suddenly, Gamus’ terrifying eyes locked back onto Lin Tian, “You’re next!” 
He charged at him like a beast, even more ferocious than any wild animal! 
Lin Tian knew he couldn’t afford any mistakes now. With a thought, he pulled out the Spear of Zeus, adjusted his breathing, and began using the One-Eyed Owl’s breathing technique. 
He prepared for battle. 
Just as they were about to clash. 
Gamus struck nothing but air. Surrounding him was a wasteland of yellow sand, high walls, and a pale sky. 
They were now in the Trojan Arena. 
Seeing this, Gamus laughed out loud, “The arena? Oh, how I miss this! Here, I am a true king!” 
“Your Goblin Majesty, the King of the Nile has perished. I can only summon other assistance for this battle. Arise, Garuda the Giant Eagle!” Sara said as he wielded his ancient staff. 
A massive eagle with shining talons circled above the arena. 
Its gaze sharp and predatory. 
Gamus glanced at it dismissively, then turned his eyes to Lin Tian, “Goblin, I’ll kill you first!!” 
In a flash, Gamus transformed into lightning and charged forward. 
Lin Tian wielded the Spear of Zeus, unleashing bolts of lightning in an attempt to block him, but the crazed Gamus paid no heed. 
He pushed through the attack and was soon in front of Lin Tian. 
He rained down punches. 
One grab from him, and the consequences would be dire. 
Lin Tian moved with all his agility, dodging with everything he had. To his shock, he realized the Spear of Zeus couldn’t pierce Gamus’ body. 
“Damn it, is this the Iron Body Technique?” 
This situation made him think of a legendary martial art from Earth. 
No wonder the Crocodile Demon King could only break through a bit of his flesh. 
However. 
Lin Tian suddenly thought of something. If Gamus had tempered his body like this, then there had to be a weak point—a vital spot! 
Although he wasn’t certain if Gamus was using the Iron Body Technique, the principle couldn’t be far off. 
If there was a vital point, targeting soft areas wouldn’t work. His muscles were so tightly clenched that even soft skin would be impenetrable. 
Even steel rods would get crushed in such a grip.
