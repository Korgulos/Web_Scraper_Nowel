Chapter 65: The Arrival of the Army! Great Battle! 
TL: Sungmin  
He was the lord of the enchanted forest to the east. 
He had never eaten so many people in his life. 
Just a mere goblin tribe, and yet there were so many! 
“Don’t you understand the contract between the Great Tomb and the Church? Do you want to die?” 
The Cannibal Eagle snapped out of his shock and spoke sternly. 
Lin Tian found a few who were near death due to difficult labor and gave them to him. “Don’t worry, we captured these before we came here.” 
Hearing this, the Cannibal Eagle hesitated for a long time but eventually chose to accept. 
He was too tempted. 
But he also feared causing trouble. 
In ten seconds, he swallowed a human whole. 
After almost being full, he said, “Very good. Do you have a name?” 
“Lin Tian.” 
“Good, if you have any problems in the future, come to me anytime. I will ensure your safety and that you can develop steadily here.” 
The Cannibal Eagle had someone bring a sack to pack the rest. 
Lin Tian raised his eyebrows slightly, somewhat surprised. “Thank you for your concern, Lord. If you want more, I can offer you a few more humans.” 
“Hahaha! Then I won’t be polite! I will first report the situation to the other lords!” 
Immediately, the Cannibal Eagle took off, transforming into a black meteor and disappearing. 
Lin Tian let out a long sigh of relief. 
Now they could finally develop without worry. 
Everyone else wiped off their cold sweat, relieved after a false alarm. 
Looking at the newborn goblin infants, Lin Tian asked, “Gobu Yue, have you counted how many there are?” 
“Three thousand. During the second birth, there should be more, but none of the ten mutant and overlord variant offspring survived,” Gobu Yue replied while writing on a wooden board. 
Lin Tian had previously piqued her curiosity with human writing while mapping routes. 
So he taught her some basics. 
Unexpectedly, she had an extraordinary talent for learning and picked it up quickly. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian felt a bit regretful. “It seems that mutant and overlord variants are almost impossible to produce more of.” 
But it was enough for now. Next, they would capture some animals and monsters to breed more low-level goblins. 
Although they were cannon fodder, a large number of them could still overwhelm the enemy. 
“System, activate Life Simulation.” 
Lin Tian said, capturing those creatures wouldn’t require personal experience. 
Simulating directly would be faster. 
[Life Simulation System is starting, current scenario: First entry into the Great Tomb 
After enduring countless hardships, you finally settled down and could develop for a long time. 
Now you need to breed a large number of low-level goblins to expand your strength. So, you led your army into the enchanted forest to capture more. 
On the first day, you encountered many fourth and fifth-tier monsters, killed them all, and took them back as food for the new generation of goblins. 
After several days, you captured five hundred first-tier monsters, ‘Carnivorous Rabbits’ and ‘Crying Face Monkeys’. 
On the way back, you encountered a seventh-tier monster, the Thunder Mane Bear, with a strength of three thousand. 
Since it was a female, you didn’t kill it but captured it to improve the tribe’s quality. 
Tasting success, you captured several more seventh-tier monsters, imprisoning them as breeding tools. 
This greatly improved the overall quality of the tribe. 
In a month, the breeding tools for low-level goblins captured a total of three thousand, which was enough. 
Just as you were immersed in the joy of rapid development, the tribe was unexpectedly attacked by humans. 
Option 1: Face them head-on, not fearing them in your home ground. Rating: 30 
Option 2: Hold your ground. Rating: 20 
Option 3: Negotiate to find out their intentions. Rating: 0] 
“Human attack?” 
Seeing this, Lin Tian was full of questions. 
Wasn’t this the Great Tomb? How could humans dare to come here? 
The rating wasn’t important to Lin Tian; he needed to understand their intentions. 
So, he chose Option 3. 
[They didn’t respond. By the time you realized it, soldiers were descending from the cliffs and began a massacre in the tribe. 
Several Holy Guards appeared at the front and back, encircling you. 
After a fierce battle, you escaped with a few people, suffering a crushing defeat.] 
Seeing this, Lin Tian immediately understood. 
The Lionheart Empire’s people and those church Holy Guards they encountered before. 
Even daring to enter the Great Tomb, it seemed they were desperate. 
Lin Tian immediately interrupted the Life Simulation to think of a way to respond before they arrived. 
[Summary: When a lion is angry, make sure it can’t bite you. 
Rating: 10 points (out of 100) 
Reward: Life Points x10 
This Life Simulation is complete, the time span was one month.] 
“Brutal, do you know where the lord lives?” 
After returning, Lin Tian quickly asked. 
The last time, that guy left in a hurry without telling him how to find him. 
Hearing this, Brutal thought for a moment. “Just in the highest forested area around here. He and his tribe live there.” 
Lin Tian acknowledged with a nod, having figured out a solution in his mind. 
As long as he summoned that guy, the people from the Lionheart Empire and the Church wouldn’t dare to do anything to him. 
Now, he could continue to develop his strength with peace of mind. 
In the future, he definitely needed to eliminate the thorn that was the Lionheart Empire, and the Holy Church as well. 
Otherwise, he couldn’t consider himself truly safe. 
A month quickly passed, arriving at the day of the Empire and Church’s ambush. 
Lin Tian had already found the Cannibal Eagle and informed him of the situation in advance. 
“How do you know? They couldn’t possibly dare to come. The Great Tomb has a contract with the Church,” the Cannibal Eagle said in disbelief. 
Lin Tian didn’t know how to explain, so he simply said, “When I was outside, I saw their army approaching. Considering what happened before I came here, they must be coming to attack me.” 
Hearing this, the Cannibal Eagle understood. “I see. Don’t worry, I won’t let humans run wild in the Great Tomb. Not just me, the others in the Great Tomb won’t allow it either. 
Let me report this, then I’ll come to find you.” 
“Thank you, Lord,” Lin Tian said gratefully before returning to the Tian Kuang Tribe to wait. 
Time ticked by slowly. 
Gobu Tian, who was scouting outside, returned and pointed to the top of the valley. “There are humans sneaking up there, boss. Should we take them out?” 
“Don’t rush. What about the army outside?” Lin Tian was more concerned about that. 
Gobu Tian replied, “They’re still about twenty kilometers away, stationed at the edge of the Great Tomb.” 
Lin Tian acknowledged this and rode up to look at the top of the valley. 
Sure enough, there were a few blurry figures on the cliff, secretly watching them. 
On the steep cliff, an imperial scout in stealth clothing exclaimed, “Damn, didn’t the report say this tribe had at most a few hundred goblins? Why do I see thousands?” 
“After kidnapping so many village women, what do you think? It’s infuriating!” another man said through gritted teeth. 
The man in stealth clothing scanned the area, and when he saw the seventh-tier monsters imprisoned with their rear ends facing out, he was stunned! 
He couldn’t help but ask, “Why are there so many high-tier monkeys?” 
“They’re not monkeys! Do you see? Seventh-tier monsters like the Thunder Mane Bear, Devil Stag, and Corpse Python—all not to be trifled with!” 
The other man explained, increasingly shocked as he watched. 
A mere goblin tribe had imprisoned so many seventh-tier monsters! Seventh-tier monsters could destroy a small town. 
But the man in stealth clothing was still puzzled. “Isn’t it only monkeys whose butts turn red? This…damn! It can’t be!” 
As he wondered, he seemed to realize something. 
These seventh-tier monsters, each feared outside… 
Had become breeding tools for the goblins! 
The other man also realized this, even more shocked. “No wonder the Sword Saintess fell victim! We need to report back immediately. It’s too dangerous here!” 
Just as the two were about to climb up and escape by another route. 
They turned and found themselves face-to-face with Gobu Tian and a group of hero-variant Dark Goblins, coldly watching them from the cliff like spiders. 
The man in stealth clothing was so scared he slipped, screaming as he fell, “Aaaah!” 
“Splat!” 
He was shattered to pieces! 
Gobu Kuang, who was daydreaming, was overjoyed. “Boss, it’s raining meat! Hahaha!” 
He quickly picked up the pieces and stuffed them into his mouth. 
The meat rain left Lin Tian speechless. “Eat as much as you want. You’re almost evolving into a leader variant.” 
Currently, he was only fifth-tier, and the leader variant was sixth-tier, with the overlord variant being seventh-tier. 
However, if he evolved to sixth-tier, his strength could even crush some seventh-tier beings. 
Recently, every goblin in the tribe had enjoyed an unprecedented number of new breeding tools. 
The group of seventh-tier monsters with red rears was proof. 
By this time, Gobu Tian had already captured the other Imperial scout and climbed back down. “All taken care of, boss.” 
“Good, this will make them hesitate to attack recklessly,” Lin Tian said. 
As long as the enemy didn’t launch a mindless all-out attack, they could hold their ground and wait for the Cannibal Eagle to arrive. 
Outside the Great Tomb. 
A well-equipped Imperial army stood ready. 
The dense crowd spread out massively. 
This time, the Lionheart Emperor had deployed over ten thousand elite soldiers with a clear purpose: to wipe out Lin Tian and his tribe. 
The army’s imposing presence forced the monsters on the edge of the Great Tomb to flee wildly. 
Klein stood at the front of the army, pacing back and forth on his carnivorous horse. 
Waiting for the scouts’ report. 
Unable to hold back, he spoke, “Warriors! Today, we must prepare to not return until we’ve exterminated those goblins! Are you ready to enter the Great Tomb?” 
“Yes!!!” 
The ten-thousand-strong shout was deafening! 
Only then did Klein feel at ease, his eyes burning with anger. 
Ten Holy Guards stood solemnly at the edge of the Great Tomb. In front of them, sunlight shone in a range of over ten meters! 
This was the first time the perpetually dark Great Tomb had seen light. 
Unfortunately. 
After waiting for three hours, the scouts didn’t return. 
Klein grew restless, his longsword craving the blood of revenge. 
At that moment, a shadow flashed across the sky. 
It was Lin Tian riding a dragon, arriving before the army. 
Klein’s intelligence indicated that a goblin leader was dragon-riding. 
He immediately shouted, “You up there, are you the goblin leader who destroyed dozens of our villages?” 
Seeing the army, Lin Tian felt some pressure. 
He hadn’t expected the Lionheart Empire to be so serious, deploying over ten thousand elite soldiers. 
However, he wasn’t afraid. 
He countered, “Have you forgotten the contract between the Church and the Great Tomb? Are you provoking us?” 
“You’re just rats hiding in the Great Tomb. Killing you doesn’t require worrying about the contract!” Klein angrily replied. 
With a “shhhk,” he drew his longsword, pointing it directly at Lin Tian.
