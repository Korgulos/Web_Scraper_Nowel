Chapter 42: Countess: Why Did Your Head Start Growing Grass? 
TL: Sungmin 
In a short time, a dozen goblins had already been sucked dry and turned into mummies. 
“Hehe, Captain, you’re too ruthless! You drained those goblins so dry, and so quickly!” 
A bat couldn’t help but comment. 
The red-fanged bat glared at it, “Hurry up and suck them dry, it’s not interesting at all. Let’s finish early and get those three hundred gold coins.” 
They had thought they might get to drink the blood of a Goblin Overlord or something similar. 
But in the end, it was just a bunch of big goblins, with very few high-tier ones. 
Under the cover of night, death kept descending. 
No one noticed a thing. 
The entire cave was still silent and quiet. 
Lin Tian was sleeping in a separate small cave, with Gobu Yue, Lia, Cassandra, and Ifreya beside him. 
A bat carefully approached, seeing humans and elves, and couldn’t help but feel overjoyed. 
He thought, “This place is so remote, quietly drinking some human blood shouldn’t be a problem, right?” 
Because they belonged to the Adventurers’ Guild, they had signed an agreement not to drink human blood. 
Even if they killed someone, they couldn’t drink the blood if they wanted to maintain their status and work in the Lionheart Empire. 
So, these vampires became adventurers, earning money to buy blood. 
This bat looked at Ifreya’s extremely white neck and couldn’t resist any longer, “Money is hard to earn, shit is hard to eat, drinking here won’t be discovered!” 
Driven by his bloodthirsty desire. 
He couldn’t help but sink his fangs in. 
When his sharp fangs pierced that tender neck like tofu, instantly! 
A burst of holy light exploded! 
It directly illuminated the small cave and woke up Lin Tian and the others. 
“Who!” 
Lin Tian woke from his sleep, raising his crossbow to attack, but saw no one. 
Only a very small shadow flew out. 
Sensing something was extremely wrong, he ordered, “You all stay here, I’ll go check it out!” 
In the cave, the bat had its teeth shattered completely, “Damn it! A holy nun! Why is there a holy nun in a goblin cave!!” 
He would rather believe that someone had dug up his ancestral grave than believe this! 
But the holy light just now couldn’t be mistaken. 
“Captain! There’s a holy nun!” 
The bat flew to the living area’s main cave and shouted urgently. 
The Church’s forces were like natural enemies to vampires, they didn’t dare provoke them. 
Hearing this, the red-fanged bat, who was about to continue drinking blood, paused, “Are you crazy? How could there be a nun in this cave?” 
“Everyone, be on alert!!!” 
At this moment, a shout came from the depths of the cave. 
All the goblins got up and were on high alert! 
Lin Tian, seeing the group of bats, felt something was wrong, “Goblins generally don’t let bats into their caves, how come…” 
As he was thinking this, he noticed some goblins hadn’t gotten up. 
Upon closer inspection, he finally saw clearly! 
They had all turned into dried corpses! 
“Vampires!” 
Lin Tian immediately thought of this, shouting, “Light the fire! Seal the exit!” 
Gobu Shan and the others quickly began to act. 
In the pitch-dark cave, a raging fire was lit! 
The goblins surrounded all the bats in the center. 
Lin Tian said, “Dare to come here to drink blood, I want to see what you vampires can do!” 
“Captain, what do we do?” 
A bat asked, but showed no sign of fear. 
The red-fanged bat started spinning rapidly, forming a cloud of black mist, which slowly descended and turned into a human form! 
Wearing black light armor, with fair skin, and very elegant auburn hair. 
Lilith’s eyes were sharp, “Since we’ve been exposed, let’s start killing. It’s just a group of goblins.” 
As soon as she finished speaking, the remaining dozen goblins also transformed into human forms. 
And they were all women! 
The most venomous were women’s hearts! 
Lin Tian scrutinized her, deciding to check her attribute panel first. 
What he saw shocked him! 
[Lilith: Lv61<br/>
Race: Vampire<br/>
Profession: None<br/>
Titles: Countess, Immortal, God’s Curse…<br/>
Health: 1900<br/>
Strength: 500<br/>

Overall: 2800] 
Such high attributes! 
Almost three thousand! 
The remaining vampires also had nearly two thousand in strength! 
Damn, how could they possibly win? 
Wouldn’t they be annihilated? 
Lin Tian quickly changed his tone, “Ahem, madam, we can talk this out, no need to be like this.” 
“There’s nothing to talk about. Didn’t you want to see our abilities just now? Come on.” Red Fang Lilith sneered. 
If they had been discovered when they first entered, they would have fled immediately. 
But now they were all full of blood, their strength greatly enhanced, why would they be afraid? 
Seeing her malicious intent, Lin Tian said, “If we fight, neither of us will benefit. Vampires fear fire, don’t they?” 
Red Fang Lilith sneered and snapped her fingers. 
All those dried goblin corpses on the ground stood up! Their eyes glowed red, and their fangs protruded; she had infected them all with vampirism! 
They surrounded them. 
Lilith continued, “Do you think the fire will reach us first, or will you die first? Hmph.” 
“Hallelujah!!!” 
Suddenly, a burst of holy light attacked! 
It directly forced Lilith and the others to retreat behind the dried goblin corpses. 
It was Lin Tian standing upright, with his arms outstretched, forming the shape of a cross. 
“My hair! A goblin, a goblin is posing as a cross!” 
“He actually shouted those four words, ‘holy shit!'” 
“Pickled radish! Should we rush up and tear him apart first? This low-level goblin isn’t simple!” 
A group of vampires was dumbfounded! 
A goblin knew how to pose like this! 
Lilith also didn’t react immediately and quickly said, “Tear him apart!” 
Lin Tian quickly ordered, “Everyone, hold this pose like me!” 
When all the goblins posed as crosses, the holy light actually illuminated the entire cave at that moment! 
If the Church’s people saw this, they’d probably exclaim in awe! 
Monsters using holy skills to fight other monsters! 
Both sides remained in a standoff. 
Neither moved, unless the other did. 
Finally, Lin Tian couldn’t bear it anymore, “This is pointless. How about we negotiate?” 
Lilith was silent for a moment, “Speak!” 
Indeed, being bathed in holy light made it hard for them to move and very uncomfortable. 
“What do you want?” Lin Tian asked directly. 
Logically, vampires wouldn’t specifically come to kill him, right? 
Lilith didn’t hide it, “We are an adventurer team from the human side. Someone posted a bounty, so of course, we came to kill you.” 
“Damn, so I was on a bounty list? No wonder so many adventurers came to Bright Town!” Lin Tian realized. 
Then he asked, “You vampires, still need to earn money?” 
He really couldn’t understand what they needed money for. 
A vampire, displeased, said, “Don’t we need money to buy blood? Do you think in the Lionheart Empire, we can kill people whenever we want? Guardian Holy Sword, Holy Church, which of these are easy to mess with?” 
“I see, how about we cooperate?” 
Lin Tian first canceled the pose, signaling the other goblins to cancel as well. 
There was no need to fight in this situation; cooperation could be mutually beneficial. 
Seeing this, Lilith wanted to strike directly but held back, “How do we cooperate?” 
Lin Tian thought for a moment, feeling a bit embarrassed, “Don’t you need blood? How about I provide it for you?” 
“Boss, they are vampires; they need a huge amount of blood every day!” At this moment, Lia ran out, worriedly saying. 
Lin Tian ignored her. 
Lilith snorted coldly, “Your little bit of blood is not enough for long-term supply. You have guts; we can leave directly.” 
She didn’t expect goblins to exorcise demons! 
She had to admit defeat. 
Otherwise, they could have easily killed them all. 
“Wait, I said it’s enough, and it will be enough.” Lin Tian stopped them, speaking seriously. 
Lilith and the others looked at her in surprise. 
“In traditional Chinese medicine, there are records stating that the kidney governs essence and blood; it’s the most important organ for a person. To be healthy, you must avoid kidney deficiency.” 
Hearing this, a group of vampires was confused and naive, asking in detail, “What do you mean?” 
Lin Tian coughed, suppressing his embarrassment, “It’s literal. Medical research has shown it. 
Moreover, a type of monster discovered this special effect long ago, which is the succubus. 
Otherwise, why would they extract everywhere without harming lives or stealing money? 
To gain such good nutrition, who would resort to theft or murder? 
You know, we goblins lack everything but that. We can form a long-term cooperative relationship, ensuring you don’t run out of blood to drink.” 
Seeing they seemed unbelieving, Lin Tian immediately prepared to demonstrate. 
This was a conclusion of Chinese medicine culture, and Lin Tian firmly believed the effect would be the same. 
Lilith roughly understood. 
After much thought, she found this method feasible! 
But it had to be tested first. 
She reached out to take it. 
A vampire behind her pulled her back, “Captain, we are the Count’s wives. Although he is sealed, aren’t we supposed to wait for him?” 
“Yes, this is too disrespectful to the Count.” 
“If this is true, we can wait safely without taking risks. Wouldn’t that be better? Over the centuries, how many sisters have died, don’t you know?” 
As the captain and the rightful wife of Count Dracula, Lilith had to bear a certain responsibility. 
Without hesitation, she walked towards Lin Tian. 
After all, it was just for the sustenance of life, without any further relationship. 
It didn’t count as betraying the Count. 
When Lilith drank the “blood.” 
As her bloodthirst was suppressed, she couldn’t help but feel excited, “It really can replace blood!! Everyone, we no longer need to take risks every day, as long as we cooperate with these goblins!” 
“No way, we should have discovered this earlier! Damn succubi monopolized this information since ancient times!” 
“Is this true? Let me try!” 
A vampire couldn’t resist trying. 
The result was uncontrollable. 
One after another, they tried, and without exception, it was true! 
The bloodthirst in the vampires’ bodies could be suppressed. 
Lin Tian was almost turning into a dried corpse, “Lia, support me a bit, huff, huff…” 
“Boss, you’ve worked hard.” 
Lia said with a mix of amusement and concern. 
At this moment, Lilith became serious, “Goblin, I agree to your cooperation. What do you want in return?” 
“It’s simple. Just protect this cave from intruders. I won’t make you go out either. It’s perpetually dark here; you can stay unrestricted.” Lin Tian spoke solemnly. 
Recruiting these vampires wasn’t just because he had no other choice. 
He hadn’t tested the vampire race yet. 
It was a great opportunity to improve the group’s quality and gain attributes. 
However, he did feel a bit sorry for their ‘Count.’
