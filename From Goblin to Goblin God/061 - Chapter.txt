Chapter 61: Stepping into the Great Tomb! 
TL: Sungmin  
After running for a long time, when Lin Tian realized they hadn’t caught up, he thought he couldn’t just keep running away. 
There were many experience packs there that hadn’t been consumed yet. 
There were even large ones like the Minotaur. 
So, he quietly snuck back. 
When he was sure there was no one around Bright Town, he crawled out of the bushes. 
“Where are the bodies? They actually buried them all.” 
Lin Tian was puzzled for a moment, but then he understood when he saw many simple, nameless tombstones standing in the ruins. 
Fortunately, the Minotaur’s body was still there. It seemed they weren’t kind enough to bury the monsters as well. 
He feasted for a day and a night, almost devouring everything, including the ten-meter-tall Minotaur corpse. 
He ate until he was nauseous and finally reached level eighty! 
Because goblins didn’t have the ability to gain experience by killing enemies, they could only grow stronger by continuously devouring flesh through the skill Gene Devour. 
Fortunately, using the Gene Devour skill on corpses didn’t cause a feeling of fullness. 
Otherwise, he would have already burst. 
The nausea came from eating for a very, very long time. 
He was almost exhausted. 
“Damn, at least I’m level eighty now. Going back to train my overall strength should bring it close to four thousand.” 
Dragging his weary body, Lin Tian could finally head back. 
Moreover, 
This time he had won a great victory! 
Not only did he eliminate the most troublesome opponent, but he also secured a long period of development and prospects for the Tian Kuang Tribe. 
As for the future. 
When Lin Tian arrived outside the waterfall cave, he saw the so-called “future.” 
It was Brutal. 
Through him, he could lead all the goblins into the Great Tomb for protection. 
They wouldn’t have to fear human retribution anymore. 
Moreover, even people from the Holy Church wouldn’t dare to enter casually. 
Lin Tian called out to him, “Oi, what are you sneaking around at the entrance for?” 
“My tribe is gone now. I want to follow my king.” 
Brutal spoke with a longing like a little baby. 
Lin Tian smiled lightly, “Wait here. I’ll get her to agree.” 
The main thing was he couldn’t enter, so he had to wait here. 
When he entered the cave, everyone saw Lin Tian return and immediately asked. 
“How did it go? Did you win?” 
“Boss, boss, tell me what happened.” 
“Oh my God, did you notice? The boss seems even stronger, and he feels really powerful!” 
Gobu Yue, Goblin Slayer, Lia, and others were all very curious. 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but feel a bit proud, “Don’t you know my skills? The Sword Saintess has been reshaped into my form.” 
At this moment. 
Everyone was in awe. 
The most surprised was Goblin Slayer, who said incredulously, “No way, you defeated her? Not only did you defeat her, but you also mated with her?” 
“Of course, but unfortunately, the Holy Church took her away.” 
Lin Tian said with some disappointment, reminiscing about the intense moments with the Sword Saintess, the impact was so strong! 
It was unforgettable. 
That was a perfect body like never before. 
Suddenly, Goblin Slayer hugged Lin Tian tightly, rubbing their faces together, “I knew you were the best, a perfect specimen. Come on, I want it!” 
“No! I don’t want it today. Let me off, I’m too tired.” 
Lin Tian quickly refused, jumping out of her embrace. 
Then he got to the main point, “You know the guy outside, right? He wants to join us. We can use his identity to move to the Great Tomb.” 
“To the Great Tomb?” 
Goblin Slayer was a bit surprised but trusted Lin Tian’s decision, “No problem.” 
Then, Lin Tian gathered all the goblins and instructed, “Everyone, take a rest. Tomorrow we have big things to do!” 
“Long live the boss!” 
“Alright!” 
“I love doing big things! Let’s do it!” 
A group of goblins cheered, waving their arms and legs. 
Lin Tian lay in his nest, thinking about where to start with the big event tomorrow. 
Previously, riding on the little dragon, Xiao Huan, he had mapped out the entire area. 
Including the terrain, villages, rivers, and so on. 
The most important were the villages. 
Within a few hundred miles, there were more than ten villages of various sizes, each with about a hundred people. 
That’s roughly over a thousand people. 
Subtracting the elderly and children, there were only two or three hundred women left, maybe more if they were lucky. 
“It doesn’t feel like enough. We’ll have to plunder them all along the way.” Lin Tian thought. 
Since the Great Tomb had a non-aggression pact with the Holy Church. 
Before going to the Great Tomb, he needed to prepare enough breeding tools. 
In there, he would have enough time to build a large goblin tribe. 
The prerequisite was having enough breeding tools. 
Snatching a few hundred or even a thousand was necessary, and the plan was to use humans to breed an elite force. 
As for low-level goblins, it was sufficient to use ordinary animals and monsters for mass production. 
That would definitely not be lacking. 
Previously, due to the need for secrecy and food shortages, only high-quality goblins were produced in small quantities, avoiding mass production of low-level goblins. 
In the Great Tomb, that wouldn’t be necessary. 
Lin Tian could fully unleash his plans there. 
… 
The next day. 
The entire Tian Kuang Tribe was mobilized, taking out several hundred large hemp sacks woven by the elves. 
Each sack could easily hold two people. 
Lilith and the others turned into bats and hid in one sack to avoid sunlight. 
They also brought along the original hundred breeding machines. 
“King, you’ve come out… I want to…” 
When Brutal saw Goblin Slayer, he quickly knelt down. 
Before he could finish his sentence, Goblin Slayer said casually, “No problem, but you must follow his commands completely, seeing him as you would see me.” 
Then, Goblin Slayer walked towards the front of the main force, not even bothering to glance at Brutal. 
That was an overlord variant. 
Just one step away from a king variant, not even worth looking at. 
Brutal nodded repeatedly, “Then I’ll call you boss too. Boss, what are we going to do?” 
“Go to your tribe and prepare for us to move over there. But before that, we need to raid some villages.” Lin Tian said. 
Brutal was slightly stunned, then nodded repeatedly, “Great! Wonderful!” 
Lin Tian whistled to summon the dragon Xiao Huan, rode her, and led the way with a map in hand. He instructed, “Follow closely. Remember, we only capture women. If there are slightly older girls, they can be taken too; they can be used when they become adults. As for the men, kill those who resist. If they don’t resist, do whatever you want with them.” 
“Of course, eat them, hehe.” Gobu Kuang licked his tongue and smiled. 
As for Gobu Shan, the corners of his mouth reached his ears, “Of course, something more enjoyable than eating.” 
Soon. 
They saw small scattered houses at the foot of the distant mountain, with smoke curling up. 
The wheat in the fields was golden and ripe. 
It seemed this autumn was another harvest season. 
The residents of each household were probably eating, preparing to continue harvesting wheat after their meal. 
In the village. 
A man with a white cloth cap on his head was eating bread, with some wild vegetables and jam on the table. 
The man smiled and said, “My wife, how much wheat do you think we’ll harvest this year?” 
“You look so happy. But honestly, it should be twice as much as last year. We’ll have enough food every day, and Grew will grow up quickly.” 
Beside him, a beautiful woman said with a smile, gently touching the little boy in front of the table who was eating bread. 
Amidst the family’s laughter. 
Suddenly, there was a loud bang! 
The wooden house wall was suddenly smashed open, and the whole house shook, seemingly about to collapse. 
Gobu Kuang was the first to rush in, grinning foolishly, “Caught them, top-quality breeding tools, hehe!” 
“What kind of monster is this! Run!” 
The man’s expression changed drastically, quickly grabbing the bread knife beside him. 
But even with a weapon in hand, he felt no sense of safety. 
This small knife wouldn’t even hurt them if he stabbed a hundred times. 
Gobu Kuang grabbed the woman first, making her almost faint from fear. 
The child cried out, “Mom, let go of my mom!” 
“Grew, run!” 
The man, furious, stabbed Gobu Kuang’s thigh with the knife. 
Unfortunately, it only caused a superficial wound. 
Gobu Kuang felt a sting, angrily grabbed the man, and squeezed! 
“Crack, crack… splat!” 
The man’s bones shattered, and he spat out a mouthful of blood, dying on the spot. 
The woman cried, “Husband! Husband! Grew, run and find the village chief to save your dad!” 
When the child opened the door, he was completely stunned. 
In the village, flames raged, and a large group of goblins was slaughtering and looting. Women were being drugged and thrown into sacks like objects. 
Suddenly, Grew felt Gobu Kuang approaching from behind. 
He was so scared that he collapsed, crawling and crying, “Don’t come near, don’t come near… sob, sob.” 
“Kid, you have to eat well to grow as tall as me.” 
Gobu Kuang shoved bread into Grew’s mouth as easily as picking up a grain of rice. 
Then he walked away. 
In less than an hour, the village was almost completely looted. 
Lin Tian didn’t restrict them from killing people, as it would undermine his authority and cause them to lose themselves. 
He was no longer human but a bloodthirsty goblin who killed without hesitation. 
So, he used goblin methods to rule this tribe. 
Almost no one was left alive in the village, but some managed to escape. 
Their main goal was to capture women, not kill people. 
Lin Tian and his group walked on the road ahead, with the remnants of the village, now in flames and filled with cries, behind them. 
“Let’s go to the next one.” 
… 
In a few days, they raided almost ten villages, but the number they wanted was still far from enough. 
They had only captured about two hundred thirty women. 
“Continue advancing under Brutal’s lead. I’ll scout ahead.” 
Lin Tian said, riding the dragon to map out the villages along the way to the Great Tomb. 
After half a day, he was almost at the destination. 
Looking at the so-called “Great Tomb” – the enchanted forest, Lin Tian couldn’t help but sigh, “Is that the Great Tomb?” 
Flying high in the sky, the horizon ahead was pitch black, even with the blazing noon sun. 
That enchanted forest, spanning nearly ten thousand kilometers, was full of unknown terrifying monsters. 
However, there were no villages nearby. 
Even with a contract with the church, people didn’t dare to live too close to the Great Tomb. 
After all, some monsters were low in intelligence and wouldn’t care about any contracts.
