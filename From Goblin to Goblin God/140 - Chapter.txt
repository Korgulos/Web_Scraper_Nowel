Chapter 140: Drinking Bet! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Grugia, I wasn’t around for one night, and it seems like you’re about to rebel, huh?” 
The One-Eyed Owl looked at the man at the table and said with a sinister smile. 
That man was the second-in-command of the Dragon Slayer Guild. 
He possessed 80% Titan genes. 
His muscles were robust, and his bronze skin resembled that of a gladiator from ancient Rome, full of masculine energy. 
But seeing the One-Eyed Owl’s threat, Grugia hurriedly acted like a grandson, “Big Sis, don’t mess with me. Last time I got drunk and woke up naked and tied up on the street. It was worse than dying!” 
“Hmph, stand still. That was just a punishment for being drunk. If you keep acting so cocky, I have to teach you a proper lesson!” 
The One-Eyed Owl said maliciously, pressing down on his shoulder. 
The crowd started to cheer, “Yes! Hahaha! Get him!” 
Grugia still didn’t give in, “Big Sis, please don’t mess with me, okay? I won’t act cocky anymore…” 
“Hmm?” The One-Eyed Owl didn’t speak but applied a bit of pressure. 
Grugia felt his shoulder was about to break, “It’s going to break, Big Sis! I’ll do it, okay?” 
“Fill it up!” 
“Gulp, gulp, gulp…” 
As the beers went down one after another, 
the One-Eyed Owl drank more and more energetically, while Grugia couldn’t take it anymore. 
He picked up a beer, drank for a long time, and ended up throwing up everything he had just drunk back into the glass. 
Before long, 
He admitted defeat. 
The One-Eyed Owl laughed heartily, “That’s it? Men are such useless creatures. Now, strip him naked and throw him onto the street. Remember to cover him with a blanket so he doesn’t catch a cold, haha!” 
“Got it, Big Sis!” 
Everyone got excited immediately. 
They gleefully lifted Grugia and carried him out to the street. 
“One, two, three, throw!” 
“Thud…” 
They threw him on the ground like trash. 
Many girls who saw the indecent scene screamed and ran away. 
Lin Tian was completely bewildered. Were these guys serious? 
Through the system, he could see that this Grugia had a combat power of 9,999, on par with Veronica. 
These few guys, although not total rookies, had much lower combat power, yet they dared to do this! 
They just threw him onto the street. 
And also, 
when these guys saw him coming, they acted as if he didn’t exist. 
They just went about their business. 
“Excuse me, excuse me…” 
The few who came back even politely greeted him as they passed the door. 
At this moment, Lin Tian understood deeply what kind of organization this was. 
No wonder they were said to be a bunch of lunatics and nutcases. 
The One-Eyed Owl sat at the table, “Who’s next? Why isn’t anyone challenging me today? Can’t beat me, can’t outdrink me, you guys are pathetic!” 
“I’ll go!” 
Immediately, a man stepped up, eager to join. 
Lin Tian watched for over two hours. 
The atmosphere was indeed spot-on, and he even felt like he was blending in with them. 
Seeing the One-Eyed Owl drink another person under the table, Lin Tian clinked glasses with the man beside him, “This Big Sis is amazing. She’s already drunk five people under the table, hahaha!” 
“Yeah, brother, Big Sis is unbeatable, I respect her!” The man responded. 
He didn’t treat Lin Tian like an outsider at all. 
It made Lin Tian wonder if they were drunk or if he was. He felt like he was already a member of this guild. 
However, he was still puzzled as to why so many people kept challenging the One-Eyed Owl despite knowing they would lose and face severe punishments. 
“Hey, brother, why do people keep challenging her even though they know they can’t win? The punishments are so harsh.” Lin Tian put his arm around the man beside him and asked. 
Among the five people who were just drunk under the table, one was hung in midair, one was punished to clean the toilets for a week, one was forced not to wear clothes for half a month. 
The remaining two were forced to drink beer with a catheter. 
They were forcefully given a big glass. 
It was chaos, mixed with joy and happiness. 
Upon hearing this, 
the Dragon Slayer Guild member next to him explained in a tipsy manner, “You don’t know, brother? Our Big Sis said that anyone who can outdrink her, 
1. Can become the guild leader, 
2. Can ask her to do one thing, 
3. Can… hehe, marry her. Even if you can’t outdrink her, you have to try. What if you succeed?” 
Hearing the explanation, Lin Tian’s eyes lit up. 
So that’s how it was. 
However, this wasn’t about one person challenging several people in drinking. 
If that were the case, whoever drank last would have the best chance of winning. 
Instead, after the One-Eyed Owl drank someone under the table, she would take a sobriety pill and immediately sober up. 
Lin Tian showed an evil smile, “Brother, do you think I can outdrink her?” 
“What? Dude, are you kidding? You look so young. Who can you outdrink? At a banquet, you’d probably sit at the kids’ table.” The man scoffed. 
Suddenly, the bond between the two seemed to break. 
They released their hold on each other’s shoulders, now filled with hostility. 
Lin Tian didn’t mind and waited until another person was drunk under the table before he reached out his hand, “Big Sis, I want to drink with you!” 
In an instant, 
Everyone, who previously ignored Lin Tian, now focused their attention on him. 
“Who is he?” 
“Don’t know. Do you guys know?” 
“This kid sneaked in, get him out of here.” 
Everyone was bewildered, each one chiming in. 
It seemed Lin Tian’s presence was so low-key that no one noticed him at first. 
The One-Eyed Owl’s lips curved up slightly, “Little guy, you still haven’t left? Fine, I’ll drink you under the table and then slowly punish you!” 
She had initially decided to let Lin Tian go. 
Since he stayed, she would teach him a harsh lesson. 
Lin Tian squeezed to the front of the table and slowly sat down. 
Suddenly, two men, grinning mischievously, pressed down on his shoulders as if afraid he would run away. 
“Big Sis, how are we going to punish this little guy later?” 
The One-Eyed Owl thought for a moment, then stared at Lin Tian, “This little face has some good looks, white and tender, seems untouched…” 
What the hell? 
Is this some sudden romantic luck? Impossible! 
Lin Tian felt extremely excited at her words. 
The One-Eyed Owl was quite his type; if possible… 
He was still daydreaming when he heard her speak again, “How about we send him to the old, lonely, homeless ladies at the street corner to play with? Hehehe…” 
“Hehehe…” 
Everyone let out evil laughs. 
It was truly despicable. 
“Big Sis, don’t be so hasty with your words. What if you get drunk under the table?” Lin Tian said at this moment. 
He couldn’t help but admire how harsh the punishment was. 
Even worse than being stripped and thrown onto the street. 
Everyone sneered, “Who the hell do you think you are, thinking you can outdrink Big Sis? Insulting her or insulting us?” 
“Young people don’t know their limits. Let him understand that some places aren’t to be messed with!” 
“Big Sis, drink him under the table!” 
The One-Eyed Owl replied, “Just like I said, you can be the guild leader, you can ask me to do one thing, or you can marry me. How about that?” 
“Let’s start! Rock-paper-scissors or dice?” 
Lin Tian’s face grew serious as he prepared himself.
