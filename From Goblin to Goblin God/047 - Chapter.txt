Chapter 47: A New Hostile Tribe! 
TL: Sungmin 
… 
Summary: The narrow cave entrance has a significant terrain advantage, but don’t forget the help from the vampires. 
Score: 80 points (out of 100) 
Reward: Life Points x80 
This life simulation is complete, with a time progress of 1 day. 
“Do you want to transmigrate to the simulation progress?” 
“Transmigrate.” 
As a white light flashed through his mind, Lin Tian stood by the bloody cave entrance. 
The surroundings were filled with the corpses of slain adventurers. 
Lilith and her companions were drinking the fresh blood from the still-warm bodies, “This taste is exquisite! Human blood is indeed the best!” 
Now, infected by the blood, they were terrifying to the extreme. 
Their fangs and claws were hideous, their skin pale, and their mouths were full of blood as they crazily bit into the necks of the dead. 
The goblins were so frightened they retreated to the side, not daring to approach. 
Goblin Slayer smiled lightly, “Interesting, a goblin cave inhabited by elves, humans, vampires, and me, a half-human, half-goblin.” 
“Cough, cough, Lia, Gobu Yue, go deal with the outside first, don’t let it be exposed.” 
Lin Tian didn’t dare to disturb Lilith and her group. He asked, “Gobu Tian, no adventurers escaped, right?” 
“I’ve been guarding, no one escaped.” Gobu Tian replied. 
Thus, it was a complete victory. 
Hundreds of corpses were piled up in the living area, forming several small hills! 
The smell of blood was overwhelming. 
Loder’s pupils trembled, and he was drenched in cold sweat! 
The fear ingrained in his genes caused his heart rate to soar; he couldn’t even manage a smile! 
Even staying in this ghastly place for so long, he felt extreme terror! 
It was something inherent in human genes, unavoidable. 
In his heart, he prayed, “Father, and the Church, when will you come to save me? Cecil! You must deliver the message!” 
He didn’t expect hundreds of adventurers to die! 
Even many who were somewhat famous. 
Now, he could only hope his family would go all out or seek help from the Holy Church, especially since Ifreya was also captured. 
On the other side, Lin Tian finally managed to handle everything. 
What remained were a bunch of experience-packed corpses. 
He then counted the higher-level members of the tribe. 
Among the high-level ones, many had died, and now only fifteen were left. 
But all were at levels forty-seven or forty-eight. 
Hundreds of corpses could easily allow them to evolve into hero variants. 
“You guys come up and devour.” 
Lin Tian called out the dozen or so big variants. 
Upon hearing this order, they were ecstatic, “Thank you, Boss!!” 
They grabbed a delicate girl’s slender arm and bit down! The blood oozed out like peach juice, and they ate it along with the bone! 
It was a very tender texture. 
Then they opened the head and sucked the delicious brain. 
This girl weighed at least eighty to ninety pounds, yet within a minute, she was devoured clean. 
The goblin race was hated because they had to eat others to level up, unlike the human race, who only needed to kill enemies to level up. 
One goblin next to them had a peculiar taste and started with the fat ones. 
They sliced the fat belly with an iron sword. 
Fat oozed out, covering the ground, and the entire body looked greasy. 
The yellowish fat flowed out, resembling a butter cake. 
If it were grilled, the taste would be even better. 
But now, just having something to eat was good enough, so they devoured it ravenously. 
Because some adventurers were low-level, maybe only around level twenty or thirty. 
These dozen or so goblins devoured about a hundred people and finally reached level fifty, completing their evolution! 
The one who liked to eat fat was the first to start transforming, curling up as layers of green hard skin fell off. 
His body began to swell up continuously. 
He grew so fat he looked like a giant, his features almost indistinguishable, even fatter than ‘Mon-chan’ by a factor of two! 
If goblins were ugly, then he was uglier than a goblin. 
Lin Tian quickly checked this ugly creature’s attributes. 
[Gluttonous Goblin], with very high health, overall combat power of 1100, suitable as a tank. 
Possessed the exclusive skill ‘Gluttony’; the more he ate, the higher his health. 
He was a rare special variant. 
Most others were the most common hero variants, [Heavy Goblins], with overall strength of 900, and fully armed, they could exceed 1000. 
These goblins could wield large weapons, and if holding a giant hammer, they would be called Giant Hammer Goblins. 
Compared to typical big variant goblin warriors, their height reached about 1.8 meters, and their muscles were larger. 
There were also two more [Dark Goblins], the same as Gobu Tian. 
They belonged to the assassin class. 
Goblin Slayer remarked at this moment, “To think there’s even a Gluttonous Goblin, if he keeps eating, even the Sword Saintess might take a long time to kill him.” 
“That would take quite a long time,” Lin Tian couldn’t help but ask. This guy looked like he could eat a lot. 
With so many mouths to feed in the tribe, it would be impossible to provide enough. 
Goblin Slayer thought for a moment, “He’d have to keep eating for about a year and a half.” 
A year and a half? 
Devouring over a hundred pounds of meat in a minute. 
Lin Tian reconsidered. Since these hero variants weren’t intended for focused nurturing, as long as they could boost the overall combat strength, that would suffice. 
There were still two hundred corpses left. 
Gobu Tian, Gobu Kuang, and Gobu Shan divided one hundred among themselves. 
After all, they were the main fighting force. 
After devouring, they all reached level 60, with a strength of about 1500. Gobu Shan’s was a bit higher. 
After all, he was the only mutant variant. 
The remaining hundred were distributed among the other goblins, boosting the overall level somewhat. 
Unfortunately, the goblin’s Gene Devour skill could only devour innate skills and not those learned later on. 
Humans were the best example; each carried unique skills. 
But eating them only increased their level without gaining new abilities. 
… 
When the Sword Saintess returned, she immediately sensed something was wrong. 
The previously bustling Bright Town had become desolate again. 
She hurried to the tavern to inquire, “Boss, what happened to those who went to eliminate the goblins? Did they all leave?” 
Initially, she thought she had returned too late and that everyone had already left. 
From the Wandering Hero, she learned they had come to join the excitement. 
It was a possibility. 
However, the tavern owner looked grave, “It’s been nearly three days, and no one has returned. I don’t know what happened, maybe…” 
“You stay here; I’ll go myself!” 
Alicenia didn’t hesitate. She mounted her carnivorous horse and headed towards the enchanted forest. 
In the tavern, the Wandering Hero cared little about the others’ lives and said smugly, “Boss, shouldn’t you give this dragon-slaying warrior a drink?” 
“Humph, you barely did anything. If you want a drink, pay for it.” The tavern owner retorted irritably. 
Fighting alongside the Sword Saintess, what help could he be? The best he could do was not cause trouble. 
The Wandering Hero, feeling a bit embarrassed, took out a silver coin with a forced smile. 
In the following days, 
Alicenia tirelessly searched for any sign of the adventurers, combing through forests and canyons. 
She found it incredibly strange, “Why can’t I find any trace? Did hundreds of people just vanish? Or did they flee?” 
If she had to be serious, she preferred to believe they fled. 
Vanishing was almost impossible. 
So many people, not even leaving battle marks, were completely wiped out? Even if she fought, there would be signs of battle. 
She could only return to Bright Town in frustration. 
The Wandering Hero was still there, waiting for others to return and brag about slaying an ancient dragon. 
Seeing the Sword Saintess return, he quickly asked, “Sword Saintess, did you find them?” 
“Not a single trace, it’s as if hundreds of people vanished.” 
The confusion never left Alicenia’s face. 
In a fit of anger, she grabbed a whole bottle of whiskey. 
She downed it as if it were nothing. 
The Wandering Hero couldn’t believe it either. Hundreds of adventurers vanishing seemed impossible. 
He quickly suggested, “Sword Saintess, could there be something fishy?” 
“Do me a favor, guard Bright Town. I need to go out for a bit, no more than a month.” 
Finally, Alicenia stood up, looking serious. 
The Wandering Hero didn’t refuse, “I won’t decline your request, but where are you going…” 
Alicenia walked out of the tavern and mounted her carnivorous horse, “I need to gather my former team and deal with those goblins. I refuse to believe goblins can stir up such trouble.” 
With that, she kicked her horse and left Bright Town. 
Long ago, she had been an adventurer and held a legendary badge, though that was a long time ago. 
Since being recognized by the Holy Sword, she had left her team. 
“So exciting! Because of a group of goblins, the legendary hunter team is reassembling!” 
The Wandering Hero sighed. Witnessing such a moment would boost his own fame! 
… 
In the cave, 
Lin Tian had sent Gobu Tian and the others to check the situation and learned that the Sword Saintess had left Bright Town. 
Finally, after hiding for so long, they could go out and breathe some fresh air! 
“Lilith, do you want to go out and have some fun?” Lin Tian asked. 
Lilith licked her lips, her eyes hazy, “No, I’m a homebody. I’m happy as long as I’m fed.” 
Goblin Slayer, somewhat annoyed, said, “You eat all day, I never get a turn. Damn bat, want me to burn you with fire?” 
“Hehehe.” 
Gobu Yue forced a bitter smile beside them, seeing them about to argue again. 
She had witnessed such scenes too many times. 
Lin Tian quickly mediated, “Blame me, alright? I’ll work hard so everyone can have their share.” 
If not for his goblin body, he couldn’t handle so much. 
Besides, Gobu Yue required mating at least once a day to keep her level up. 
Though he didn’t know the world’s level cap, continuous improvement was better than none. 
The elf Lia also needed loyalty maintenance, so she had to be fed. 
Luckily, only Lilith needed help among the vampires, or he would have been drained dry. 
“I need to find a way to improve my body; it’s severely limiting my power.” Lin Tian sighed. 
Every night, they didn’t spare him, often taking advantage when he was asleep. 
He woke up the next day feeling weak and sore. 
Could goblins even get such a disease? 
He finally muttered, “I’ll rely on the system to see if there’s a way to evolve my body.” 
Just then, a goblin sentry rushed in frantically, “Boss! A small goblin team from another tribe is approaching! They seem to be coming for us!” 
“Coming for us?” 
Lin Tian frowned. There shouldn’t be any goblin tribes within a hundred miles. 
Could it be the previous owner of this cave? 
He immediately ordered, “Gobu Tian, Gobu Shan, get ready. We need to capture this team alive; they might be a special squad from a larger tribe!”
