Chapter 213: The Unusual Old Man 
TL: Sungmin  
“Let’s go. There’s no more value here. Sara, tell me some things about the Troy Empire.” 
Lin Tian turned around casually, speaking with ease and satisfaction. 
After devouring Joan of Arc, his stats had increased, and his combat power had risen by a solid three thousand! 
He had now reached a total of thirteen thousand. 
If he could gather more demigods, his strength would skyrocket even further! 
But they had to be female. 
However, demigods were already rare on this continent, let alone female ones. Plus, dealing with them carried risks since they were usually the illegitimate children of gods. 
After all, they were the offspring of divine beings. 
Thinking about gods, Lin Tian became even more excited, imagining controlling the world and manipulating all living beings. 
What would happen if a god fell into his hands? 
He suddenly grew interested in the legendary mother of Joan of Arc—Athena, the Goddess of War. 
But he quickly snapped out of it. 
Such fantasies were best left to idle daydreams for now. 
If he had relied solely on mating to gain strength from the beginning, he never would have made it this far. 
Developing his own power and gradually gaining control of the entire wilderness was the priority. 
At that point, he could focus on strengthening his team in preparation for breaking through the wilderness and hunting demigods. 
On the way back, Sara was already overwhelmed with emotion, eager for the day to come. 
Although it was because of Lin Tian that her reputation had been ruined, if she could bring the kind of glory that might save the Troy Empire, it would be a blessing. 
“The Troy Empire, aside from us Trojan heroes, also has three powerful war gods. Each of them is as strong as a Demon King. 
My father… no, the King of Troy, also possesses a Sun-Class magic tool, the Millennial Eye, capable of unleashing destructive light. As for the rest, I don’t think you need to worry.” 
Sara explained patiently, directly revealing the Empire’s secrets. 
Lin Tian nodded, “So, it’s mostly about the top-level combat power. I’ll handle it.” 
It was exactly as he expected. 
Now, it was no longer about winning through the sheer number of soldiers. 
It was all about high-level power. 
Focusing only on the development of the lower ranks while ignoring top-tier strength would be foolish. 
Gobu Kuang and the others were no longer useful in this phase. 
But having been loyal and following him for so long, Lin Tian couldn’t just abandon them. 
The same went for Gobu Yue, Lia, Goblin Slayer, and Kasservy—all of their combat strengths were now falling behind. 
Even Alice had weakened. 
Though Sylph had helped suppress her Darkspawn side, her power had actually diminished a little. 
“Forget it. Thinking too much is making my head hurt. Let’s deal with the Troy Empire first.” Lin Tian sighed in frustration. 
He couldn’t rush things. 
He had to take it one step at a time. 
Back in Goblin King’s City, Lin Tian immediately activated the Life Simulation System to see what would happen if he attacked the Troy Empire. 
[Life Simulation System activating. Current scenario: The Final Prey. 
You’ve been in this world for two years, rising from a weak goblin to a powerhouse. From a shattered tribe, you’ve built an empire. 
Your goal is to first control everything within the wilderness. 
The Sword Kingdom, Magic Kingdom, War Empire, Holy Tree Empire, Giant Elephant Empire, and Free Empire have all fallen under your might. 
Now, you wage war against the last remaining Troy Empire. 
The goblin army, unstoppable and thunderous, crushed the Troy Empire with overwhelming force. 
You nearly unified the entire region, with only a few small empires left, too insignificant to concern yourself with. 
However, the Trojans are fearless. The survivors disguised themselves and infiltrated Goblin King’s City, including the Trojan war gods. Over the course of a hundred assassination attempts, they finally succeeded. 
You were killed by a Trojan war god who had long since infiltrated your city. 
Summary: The Trojans are more troublesome than expected. They can be defeated, but they won’t accept failure. 
Score: 30 points (out of 100) 
Reward: 30 Life Points 
This Life Simulation has ended. Time progressed: three months.] 
Upon seeing the results, Lin Tian frowned. 
Damn it, he died again. 
But this was why the system was so important. In this world, you couldn’t let your guard down—anything could happen. 
There was no “protagonist halo.” 
Lin Tian only got to where he was now by relying on caution and intelligence, not luck. 
“So, I guess I’ll have to wipe out every last Trojan?” Lin Tian muttered to himself as he pondered. 
As for his promise to Sara? 
That had been nothing more than a ploy to keep her in check. 
He never really meant it. 
But on second thought, if he couldn’t guarantee that all the Trojans would be killed, it would be dangerous. 
In the end, it might be safer to set Sara up as a puppet queen when the time came. 
To control and rule the Troy Empire. 
After all, Hero’s Power was also an important means of resisting the demigods outside the wilderness. 
If he couldn’t gain control, Lin Tian could always wait for a better opportunity and eliminate them all. 
It would all depend on the Trojans’ awareness. 
Would they submit to his rule to slaughter the gods, or would they choose death? 
But before that, Lin Tian had to deal with the Trojan war gods who had infiltrated the city. These guys were like bombs, ready to explode at any moment. 
Even though he knew they were hiding in the city, there was no way to find them. 
They were different from the assassins of the previous three empires. 
“Go and bring Sara to me,” Lin Tian ordered. 
In the palace room, Gobu Yue responded with a sound of acknowledgment and immediately went to fulfill the task. 
Before long, Sara arrived with a flushed face, biting her red lips in anticipation of something. “Your Majesty, I… I’m not used to this,” she stammered, glancing at both Gobu Yue and Lin Tian. 
“What do you mean ‘not used to it’? Do you have any way to find the Trojan war gods? They’re in the city right now.” 
Lin Tian spoke with a complicated expression. This woman was more provocative than he had imagined. 
Upon hearing this, Sara’s expression shifted slightly. “Have they… have they come already?!” 
Lin Tian merely nodded in response. 
“Their primary target will definitely be me. If I parade through the city tomorrow, they won’t be able to resist appearing,” Sara thought for a moment and replied. 
She knew that by disgracing Troy’s honor, she was certainly marked for elimination. 
Lin Tian, however, shook his head. “Even a fool could see that’s a trap. I have a better idea. But, are you shy?” 
“Huh? I… I am a bit shy,” Sara muttered in confusion, lowering her head with embarrassment. 
Lin Tian chuckled mischievously. “Don’t worry, you’ll get used to it. I got used to it a long time ago. It’s satisfying for me, and others are just jealous. That’s how goblins are.” 
The so-called “better idea” was to provoke them. 
He would publicly trample on Troy’s honor and humiliate the Trojan princess! 
The Trojan war gods would be forced to reveal themselves, even if they knew it was a trap. 
In her moment of bewilderment, Sara for the first time realized the cruelty and treachery of human nature. 
… 
“Holy crap! The Trojan princess! His Majesty is incredible!” 
“Hurry, hurry! The Goblin King is giving out some eye-popping benefits!” 
“Honestly, I’ve been a traveling merchant for years and seen many half-humans and humans, but this is the first time I’ve seen such a rare beauty. If you ask who’s better, it’s definitely the ones around the Goblin King!” 
“Damn, I’m so envious. If only I were a goblin! At least my wife wouldn’t cheat on me with a minotaur!” 
“What did you say? A minotaur got your wife? Tell me where, I’ll go kill them for you!” 
In the crowded, chaotic streets. 
Three mysterious figures in hooded robes stood quietly amidst the commotion. 
Although their faces were hidden, the seething hatred was almost palpable. 
These were the Trojan war gods, the mentors of the King of Troy, and Sara’s very own teachers! 
Watching their disciple, the princess of an entire nation, reduced to such a state, they were gnashing their teeth in fury. 
“Everyone calm down. Something’s not right. This is probably a goblin trap. We can’t fall for it. We need to wait for the perfect moment to kill that wench and the Goblin King,” the eldest war god, ‘Gamus,’ spoke with a heavy tone. 
But the two war gods beside him could no longer restrain themselves. 
They were ready to kill now! 
“Even if it’s a trap, I’m going in!!! Those two filthy scum!!!” 
The two roared, letting out a bellow of rage! 
In an instant, their cloaks shattered from the sheer force, revealing their dark, muscular bodies. 
Barefoot, adorned with gleaming golden divine ornaments, they radiated brilliance. 
Their upper bodies were covered in ancient black runes that merged with their muscles, exuding both mystery and power. 
The roar from their outburst sent dozens of nearby monsters crashing to the ground, bleeding from their orifices. 
This was their Hero Power skill: ‘War God’s Roar.’ 
It had an offensive effect, but more importantly, it greatly enhanced their own strength and morale. 
The two war gods, like bolts of lightning, charged toward Lin Tian and Sara! 
The sheer force of their punches cut through the air, leaving a terrifying shockwave in their wake! 
Lin Tian’s heart pounded, but luckily, he hadn’t been caught off guard and maintained his high alert. 
If not, he’d already be dead. 
He quickly widened the distance between them. 
The two Trojan war gods were momentarily surprised, not expecting Lin Tian to dodge. 
But they immediately resumed their pursuit! 
“Boom!!” 
The sound of clashing power echoed like thunder. 
The One-Eyed Owl had appeared, wearing her gauntlets, and blocked one of the war gods. 
The other war god was fended off by Alice, Gobu Kuang, Lia, and others as they launched a joint attack. 
The battle had reached a deadlock. 
Down below, in the streets, the remaining Trojan war god slowly removed his cloak, revealing his aged skin and gray hair. 
The figure was emaciated and frail, his body betraying the signs of age. 
Yet his eyes were as sharp as a hawk’s. 
With a slight chuckle, he said, “These goblins are more cunning than I thought. After lying low for days, you’ve managed to force us into the open so easily. But now, I’ve gauged your strength! Today, let’s settle this once and for all!” 
Hearing the arrogant tone, Lin Tian turned toward the sound.

This power, these titles. 
Lin Tian’s expression grew more serious. Judging by his tone and the sheer strength of his stats, this man was far from ordinary! 
“Your Majesty, they are all wearing golden divine ornaments, which makes them immune to attacks from any Troy-born creatures. I can’t help you with this,” Sara quickly said after regaining her composure.
