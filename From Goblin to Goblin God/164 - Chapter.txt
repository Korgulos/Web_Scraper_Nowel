Chapter 164: More Demi-Humans Join, Rapid Economic Development! 
TL: Sungmin 
Lin Tian couldn’t help but let his gaze travel downward as he looked at the beautiful woman before him. 
Beneath her pear-shaped, full hips was a long, purple snake tail. 
This must be the snake-people race that Gobu Yue mentioned earlier. 
Among demi-human races, they were fairly common, though relatively weak in power. They were skilled in using poisons and concocting potions. 
The most famous of them was a snake-woman priestess named “Annabelle.” 
It was said that she could craft all kinds of god-level potions. 
These were far superior to super potions, and no one in the current world could replicate them. 
Unfortunately, she was later hunted down by humans and committed suicide. 
Annabelle’s emergence was a miracle in the history of the world. 
But for the snake-people, it was a catastrophe. Large numbers of them were captured and enslaved by humans, forced to make potions. 
Many were worked to death, or were beaten to death if they failed to produce potions. 
Looking at Lin Tian, Louise’s youthful and innocent face was full of confusion, her forehead already beaded with fragrant sweat. 
Her breathing was rapid. 
She stammered for a long time, “I, I…” 
Lin Tian perked up his ears, slightly raising an eyebrow as he watched her. 
He found it amusing and cute. 
Fiona quickly comforted her, “Don’t be nervous. Just tell His Majesty the Goblin whatever you need to say.” 
Louise took a deep breath. 
She tugged at her throat, as if trying to force the words out. 
But still, she deflated. 
Lin Tian was starting to grow impatient, “What exactly are you trying to say? If it weren’t for the fact that you’re good-looking, I wouldn’t have the patience to stand here.” 
Hearing this, Louise was on the verge of tears. 
She was terribly frightened, “Please don’t say that, I, I…” 
“Goblin Majesty, yes, yes, I’m Louise, representing the snake-people to greet you. We hope to r-receive your protection. Yes, that’s right, the snake-people are now hiding everywhere, and food has become scarce. So, yes, we hope to receive your protection…” 
Watching Louise stumble over her words, Lin Tian couldn’t help but feel a bit like laughing. 
He couldn’t resist asking, “Are you the leader of the snake-people?” 
Louise shook her head so vigorously that it almost became a blur. 
Seeing this, Lin Tian understood that the snake-people were being very cautious, likely sending a clueless youngster to test the waters. 
They weren’t afraid of messing things up at all. 
“Please, Lord Goblin, as long as you can protect us, I’m willing to do anything!” 
Louise shut her eyes tightly, clasping her fair hands together in a pleading gesture. 
Lin Tian teased, “Oh really? Then why are you just standing there? Take it off.” 
“Take it off? What do you mean, Goblin Majesty?” 
Louise was stunned, her large, beautiful eyes wide with confusion. 
She had lived her whole life within the snake-people tribe. 
She knew almost nothing about the outside world, let alone matters like these. 
Fiona’s expression changed slightly, “Goblin Majesty, she still seems like a child who doesn’t understand anything. Although she’s not really a child anymore, if you do that, you’ll scare her.” 
“She said it herself, so why don’t you just explain to her what she needs to do?” 
Lin Tian grinned, his eyes full of malice as he stared at her. 
His gaze made Louise shrink back like a frightened mouse. 
Gobu Yue, standing nearby, pouted, “Hmph, Boss is so bad. She looks so pitiful.” 
Fiona sighed helplessly and explained it to Louise. 
“Understand?” 
“Huh? What’s reproduction? And what does having children mean? Aren’t children just refreshed out of nowhere?” 
Louise asked, completely puzzled. 
This left Fiona at a loss for words. 
She finally dropped her smile, pointed a finger at Louise’s lower abdomen, then at Lin Tian’s. 
Then she suddenly brought her fingers together, “Got it?” 
Louise scratched her head, her hair getting all tangled, “What’s the point of doing that?” 
Seeing how clueless she was, Fiona was utterly speechless, “Are the snake-people really playing games with their own race, sending a fool like this?” 
“Huh?” 
Louise seemed to grasp that last bit. 
At this moment. 
Two small dogs in the distance sniffed each other and immediately got busy. 
Fiona’s eyes lit up, and she pointed, “It’s like that, understand, Louise? Just think of yourself as that white puppy being mounted.” 
“What?!!!” 
Suddenly. 
Louise was flustered and at a complete loss, her snake tail swishing back and forth, accidentally knocking over a table in the room. 
She turned to clean up but ended up hitting Fiona in the face a few times with her tail. 
Seeing how clumsy she was, Lin Tian couldn’t take it anymore. He grabbed her soft tail tip directly. 
“Ah!” 
In an instant, Louise’s whole body shivered, her muscles contracting, “N-no, don’t grab my tail, it feels so strange, Goblin Majesty…”  
Seeing her flushed face and her pitiful appearance, drenched in fragrant sweat. 
Lin Tian let go and said, “Alright, I was just teasing you. Go back and tell your leader that I can protect the snake-people, but in return, you’ll need to make potions for us. However, it won’t be forced; it’s voluntary.” 
“Okay, th-thank you, Goblin Majesty! I’ll go right away!” 
Louise’s eyes sparkled with excitement, revealing two small, sharp fangs filled with gratitude. 
Her tail swished as she quickly rushed out of the city. 
Hearing this, Fiona couldn’t help but feel a little upset. “Goblin Majesty, why did you treat me that way when I sought protection, but with the snake-people, you…” 
“The snake-people can make potions, while you only need to give birth to a few children. Besides, do you really have the heart to keep bullying that fool?” Lin Tian replied, somewhat exasperated. 
“Achoo!” 
Outside the city, the delighted Louise sneezed, but she didn’t pay much attention to it. 
She continued to grin from ear to ear, humming a tune as she headed back to the snake-people’s stronghold. 
Fiona, hearing this, chose not to say anything more. 
Suddenly, there was movement, and the demi-humans in the wooden huts began to emerge. 
Leading the excited group was the catgirl chieftain, with her furry beast ears and slender, delicate body. 
Her movements were much like a cat’s—extremely cute. 
“Goblin Majesty, meow, I’m Sophia, meow! You’ve finally arrived, meow!” 
The catgirl chieftain said, playfully acting cute. 
Lin Tian felt like he was about to melt—who could resist a demi-human who acted like a kitten? 
Her tail swayed back and forth around him, almost as if she was purring. 
This cat would definitely be a delight to pet! 
But first, he asked, “So, are you also here seeking protection?” 
“Something like that, meow! But we won’t freeload off Goblin Majesty, meow! We plan to run a cat café, earn money, and pay it to Your Majesty, meow!” 
Sophia tilted her head as she spoke, continuing to act cute. 
Without hesitation, Lin Tian agreed, “Approved!” 
Upon hearing this, Sophia was overjoyed. “Thank you, Goblin Majesty, meow! You must come to the café to pet us, meow meow meow!” 
Lin Tian nodded in satisfaction, then glanced around. “And what about you?” 
He hadn’t noticed before, but standing nearby was a lady in black stockings, with such seductive legs that he wanted to reach out and touch them. 
Not to mention the pair of incredibly cute ears. 
And the irresistible red high heels that surely concealed a pair of delicate feet. 
This must be the rabbit-woman tribe. 
The bunny girl quickly spoke in a sultry, yet gentle voice, “Goblin Majesty, I wish to open a tavern with my people. We’ll pay gold to Your Majesty, and whenever Your Majesty visits, drinks will be free. Also, we’ll provide s-p-e-c-i-a-l services!” 
The bunny girl deliberately emphasized the word “special.” 
Lin Tian slapped his thigh in approval. “Approved!” 
The main reason was that all of these ventures could generate economic benefits for the empire—the more, the better!
