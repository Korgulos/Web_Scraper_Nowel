Chapter 195: Rage, Troy’s Arena! 
TL: Sungmin 
… 
Under the night sky. 
The Troy Empire was ablaze with bonfires. 
Why bonfires, you ask? Because tonight was a full moon night, and it was also their monthly bonfire festival. 
On this day, families gathered. 
They lit bonfires in courtyards and on the streets, eating roasted meat, singing Trojan songs, and telling Trojan legends. 
It was a lively affair. 
In the corners of the houses, 
One by one, Phantom Worms emitting a dim blue light appeared, concentrating their glow on the tips of their noses and pointing towards the sky. 
They projected everything the mother body had seen! 
“Swish!” 
Immediately, a multitude of images, like an open-air movie, spread across the Troy Empire. 
At this moment, the King of Troy was also in the kingdom’s square, walking hand in hand with a group of nobles, singing and dancing around the bonfire. 
The surrounding nobles were all flattering him, “Your Majesty, soon the Goblin Empire will be divided among us, and by then, there will be endless wealth, hahaha!” 
“With the Princess herself leading the charge, victory is only to be expected!” 
“Indeed, the Princess will bring us endless riches! Our Troy Empire will stand on equal footing with the Demigod Empire!” 
“Let’s hold a welcoming ceremony for the King’s daughter when she returns. We should bestow upon her the highest honor of Troy!” 
“Yes, the highest honor!” 
Hearing these flatteries, 
The King of Troy grinned widely. 
Suddenly, he noticed the large projections in the sky, dazzling and bright. 
“What is that, hmm? Hahaha! This is great, who is projecting these images? Reward them for me!” 
The King of Troy’s face, illuminated by the bonfire’s light, appeared particularly greasy and flushed. 
Because he was already drunk, his eyes were a bit blurry. 
He could only make out the rough shapes, and under the influence of alcohol, he didn’t blame anyone for such a thing; instead, he found it amusing. 
The more he watched, the more excited he became, “That woman’s figure, I’ve had thousands of women, but none of them had a body as good as hers! If only she were my wife, hahaha!” 
“Find that person for me. I’ll pay ten thousand gold coins to have her husband give her to me!” 
As he watched the images in the projection, 
The faces of the nobles were filled with disbelief, shock, and some couldn’t even bear to look. Others were excited. 
Many of them stood with their mouths open, unable to utter a word. Dancing? Forget about it, the projection was far more captivating. 
The King of Troy was engrossed in what he saw, but then he said, “Are you deaf? Did you not hear what I said? Why aren’t any of you responding?” 
As he spoke, he staggered closer to get a better look. 
The more he watched, the more he realized something was wrong. 
Suddenly, he sobered up, rubbed his eyes hard, and exclaimed in shock, “Sa, Sara!!! My Sara! What’s going on! Who’s showing this projection!” 
He sprinted forward and spotted the Phantom Worms in a dark alley. 
“Buzz!” 
The power of a hero burst forth, turning everything within a hundred meters into ruins, and the Phantom Worms exploded into fragments. 
The King of Troy turned to the nobles, “How dare you keep watching! Do you want me to gouge out your eyes!!!” 
Immediately, 
The nobles lowered their heads, not daring to make a sound. 
But the images in their minds couldn’t be erased, and some of them even had physical reactions. 
The King of Troy, panicked and at a loss, looked into the distance. 
There were still many such projections in the city. 
“Ahhh! Who is doing this! This–this is impossible! Why is my Sara being defiled by a Goblin!!!” 
Roaring in anger, the King of Troy rushed into the city. 
At the same time, 
The residents of the city were equally excited, though some were as furious as the King. 
“Look! Look at our Princess Sara! How could she make such a shameful face, and with a Goblin no less!” 
“Does she even deserve to be a princess? She’s practically an animal! The way she looks insatiable makes me sick!” 
“Exactly, I’m nauseated too, my brother even threw up!” 
“Should I hate or thank that Goblin? Otherwise, I’d never have seen the princess like this in my entire life!” 
“I’m so jealous, my dear princess, boohoo! I hate it! I hate that it’s not me!” 
“After all the empire’s training, is this how she executes her first mission? The shame of Troy! Carried out right on a goblin’s bed! Disgraceful!” 
“If it weren’t for the projection, we’d never know that our precious princess is currently enjoying herself!” 
“It’s infuriating!” 
The residents’ voices roared like a storm, adding an unforgettable hue to this full moon bonfire night. 
A hue that would go down in history! 
“Damn Goblins, I’ll slaughter them all!!!!” 
In the distance, 
The King of Troy, like a madman, sped through the city, destroying any Phantom Worm he encountered on the spot! 
In no time, hundreds of Phantom Worms were dead. 
However, the entire population of the royal city had seen everything clearly; it was impossible for them to forget. 
When passersby noticed the King of Troy, they averted their eyes in panic. 
They kept their distance. 
Yet, a group of elderly Trojans had already begun to gather, preparing to march to the palace to demand an explanation. 
Each of their faces burned with anger. 
Despite their thin, dark, and aged bodies, they possessed an unyielding Trojan spirit. 
“This matter won’t end here. How could a dignified princess stoop so low? We must have an explanation!” declared the leading elder of Troy sternly. 
At that moment, 
The King of Troy turned a corner and blocked their path. “There’s no need to go to the palace. I am fully aware of the situation. I hereby announce that Muhammad Sara is stripped of all her titles and rights! She is no longer a princess, no longer my daughter, and no longer a Trojan! She is now the enemy of the Trojans! I will dispatch soldiers to have her executed!” 
He nearly shouted these words. 
Sara had not only brought shame upon him but had also disgraced the entire Troy Empire! 
For an empire with thousands of years of history, such a scandal was unforgivable. 
The one who was most furious, in fact, was the king himself. 
Upon hearing this, the elder of Troy finally relaxed. “Good, I trust that this isn’t His Majesty’s fault. Moreover, that damned Goblin must be eradicated from this world! How dare it defile our sacred and noble Trojan bloodline! It must die!” 
“No problem! Let me catch my breath, and I will deal with it later!” the King of Troy replied, panting heavily, filled with hatred. 
That night, 
The entire Troy Empire remained sleepless, each person burdened with complex emotions. 
They had never anticipated that such a thing would happen on a mission to the Goblin Empire. 
The Goblins, whom they had always looked down upon, had actually defiled their proud princess. 
And not only that, but they had also arrogantly projected it for all to see. 
… 
In the Goblin royal city, 
Lin Tian was already drenched in sweat from exhaustion, but Sara’s top-tier body was like a finely crafted gem. 
Once he had it in his grasp, he couldn’t bring himself to let go. 
Moreover, it brought forth a strong sense of possession and guilt. 
He felt an urge to shatter the gem, fearing it might fall into someone else’s hands. 
It wasn’t until he had no strength left at all, 
But even then, Sara didn’t want to stop. “Your Majesty, Your Majesty! Please, I don’t want it to end here!” 
Under Rebecca’s influence, she had even forgotten her own name. 
In her mind, there was only Lin Tian. 
Only the raw, primal hormones coursing through her. 
Lin Tian still had matters to attend to at the palace, so he grabbed a basin of cold water and mercilessly doused Sara with it. 
Only then did she gradually regain her senses. 
However, 
While being lost in fantasy and passion was delightful, reality was cruel. 
When she realized what she had done, she nearly broke down. “You! What have you done? No, what have I done! How could this happen! Was that really me just now? No, no! No!!” 
Recalling the vivid scenes and sensations from earlier, she clutched her head in despair. 
She couldn’t accept what she had just done! 
As a Trojan, and more importantly, as the Princess of Troy, 
How could she have so willingly desired such things from a Goblin! 
“I… I must kill you. No one else can ever know about this!” 
Sara desperately tried to attack. 
But she found her body aching, burning with pain, and utterly unable to move. 
Lin Tian sneered, “Don’t resist; it’s meaningless. Killing me won’t erase what you’ve done. Some things can never be undone.” 
“I just need to kill you; no one else can know! I’ll kill you, I’ll kill you, kill you…” she muttered, struggling with all her might. 
Suddenly, Sara noticed a large blue-glowing insect nearby. 
Her heart sank as if it had been struck by a heavy blow. 
She recognized the Phantom Worm! 
She immediately questioned, “You, you! Impossible! How could you control Phantom Worms, let alone have them project in the Troy Empire? Impossible!” 
“Oh, you’re afraid of that, huh? How unfortunate. Not only did I control them, but I also sent a large number of Phantom Worms to the Troy Empire. They probably livestreamed the whole thing for three to four hours. Too bad there were no tips or gifts,” Lin Tian replied with a sinister smile. 
It had been quite a satisfying livestream. 
Sara felt as if she had been torn apart, her heart writhing in agony. “Goblin, I curse you to die a horrible death!!!” 
With those words, she mustered all her strength and activated the Troy Arena! 
Lin Tian frowned, having been too absorbed in his victorious pride to dodge in time. 
The scene shifted. 
He suddenly found himself in a vast and magnificent arena! 
It resembled the ancient Roman Colosseum, with towering stands all around. 
The structure was shaped like a funnel. 
In the center was a wide expanse of yellow sand. 
However, there was no sky, no audience, everything appeared pale and dreamlike. 
Only Sara was there, sitting with difficulty on the spectator stand. 
Her deep, beautiful eyes were filled with murderous intent. “I want you to die in agony. I want you to pay for this!” 
But as she finished speaking, 
Lin Tian remained silent, and the surroundings grew eerily quiet. The atmosphere became awkward. 
But Sara didn’t have enough strength to summon more powerful creatures from Troy. 
This only made her feel even more aggrieved. 
She was filled with so much hatred, yet now she couldn’t do anything about it. 
Gritting her teeth, she managed to summon a low-level creature from Troy. “Go, Mad Gladiator, kill him! Break every bone in his body! Especially the cartilage!”
