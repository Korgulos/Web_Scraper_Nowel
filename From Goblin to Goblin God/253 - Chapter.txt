Chapter 253: Lords Gather, Kill the Goblin! 
TL: Sungmin 
Scarlett quickly spoke up, saying, “In the wilderness, a goblin has established an empire. They’re strong—practically madmen! If my lord is willing, it would be best to kill them sooner, lest, lest…” 
Suddenly! 
A crimson gaze bore into Scarlett, making every hair on her body stand on end! 
Nanavis fixed her with an uncomprehending, furious look. “You… say that again??” 
The terrifying aura she exuded! 
Not even the aura from killing the Devil Mantis Demon King was half as intense! 
Everyone present felt as though a massive weight pressed down on their hearts, almost halting their very heartbeat! 
Even their thighs couldn’t stop trembling. 
“It—it was my mistake, Lady Nanavis! I’ll leave, I’ll leave right now!”  
Scarlett, shaking in fear, crawled backward on her knees, desperate to escape! 
“Bang!” 
But in the next second, the door seemed to slam shut, held fast by some invisible force. 
Nanavis’s icy voice rang out, “You want me to go kill a goblin? And… one of those goblins from the wilderness, no less? Are you insulting me?” 
Arrogant! 
Scarlett’s forehead was slick with sweat; she had forgotten how proud the other woman was! 
Was she really about to die right after being resurrected? 
“Enough, get out of here! Killing you would be an insult to myself.” Nanavis said in disgust. 
After all, she’d already used Ultimate Domination twice, so if she wanted to kill again, she’d have to do it in person. 
That would be beneath her. 
Escaping the castle by the skin of her teeth, Scarlett’s body was drenched in cold sweat! 
Terrifying! 
Compared to Lin Tian, Nanavis was far more frightening! 
But Lin Tian—she absolutely had to kill him. 
Without returning to her own domain, she headed directly to another Lord of Sin’s location. 
Soon, she came upon a barren wasteland, desolate to the point of despair, without even a single tree or blade of grass in sight. 
This was the territory of the Demon King of Gluttony. 
Just by consuming food, he could enhance his combat power; he had no sense of taste and could devour anything. 
Even attacks and skills could be eaten. 
However… 
Scarlett hadn’t come here specifically to seek his help but to rally all the Lords of Sin—except for Pride—and inform them about the goblin. 
The Six Lords of Sin. 
It had been centuries since they had all gathered together. 
Now, they assembled in Scarlett’s Monster Town. 
… 
The Palace of Lust. 
What drew even more attention than the six Demon Kings were the obscene murals on the palace walls, full of indecent imagery and poses. 
It was practically a paradise of instruction for men. 
Every conceivable, previously unimaginable scenario could be found there. 
But the Demon King of Gluttony, occupied with the blood and meat feast Scarlett had prepared, paid them no mind. 
Though named Gluttony, his appearance defied expectation. 
Tall and thin, with gaunt cheeks, he relished his meal, his mouth dripping with blood and juices. His skin was ashen, like that of a long-dead corpse. 
“So, you called us all here for this? A goblin?” 
The muscular woman seated on the right side of the table grumbled in a displeased tone. Her figure was lean yet muscular, with every line of her muscles visible. She bore a striking resemblance to the One-Eyed Owl. 
However, she was not human, but a demon. 
Beside her rested an enormous axe, leaning against the palace wall, looking as if it would collapse from the weight. The weapon was at least four or five meters long. With a single strike, it seemed capable of bringing down heaven and earth. 
She was none other than the Demon King of Wrath, Hir. 
Scarlett, looking a bit aggrieved, replied, “Of course you wouldn’t believe me, but what if I told you that this goblin could even see through my disguise?” 
Hearing this, Hir scratched her head thoughtfully. “Huh? Now that’s something. I honestly can’t tell your disguises apart at all!” 
Back when they fought against the Demigod Empire, they had fought side by side. 
Scarlett’s tricks had frequently left Hir bewildered. 
“Oh, darling~ I think you’re just overreacting to the goblin’s petty tricks. They’re a lowly species, sly as they may be~” 
Beside Hir, a man dressed in a Western-style suit, gentlemanly in appearance, commented. His eyes gleamed with malice. 
He was the Demon King of Greed, Ladrick. 
Scarlett quickly replied, “Ladrick, I know you’re confident in your own mind, but this goblin is truly exceptional! Cunning, foresight, decisiveness—all top tier!” 
Ladrick shrugged and fell silent. 
In their battles against the Demigod Empire, his strategic mind had proven invaluable, earning him a reputation as a formidable rival second only to Pride. 
Though he had never truly demonstrated his power, he had easily toyed with the lives of millions. Meanwhile… 
A faint snoring sound began to fill the hall. 
At the table, a female demon was fast asleep, one sharp fang peeking out and a blissful smile on her face, as if she was lost in a sweet dream. Her twin ponytails gave her an innocent look, completely misleading. 
She was none other than Winnie, the Demon King of Sloth, whose strength ranked just below that of the proud Nanavis. 
Like the others, she wielded mythic-level magic, possessing an absurdly overpowered ability. 
“So you’re saying a lowly goblin has managed to conquer the entire wilderness?” 
From the end of the table, a voice full of malice and envy spoke up. 
It was the Demon King of Envy, Gallows. 
His gloomy face made his appearance menacing to behold. 
The envy in his gaze seemed to declare that anyone who dared offend him would be killed without hesitation! 
Scarlett felt a wave of physical revulsion toward him but managed to respond, albeit hesitantly. “Y-yes, that’s right.” 
Gallows’s mouth twisted in contempt. “A species so vile and base could possess such power? So, what’s the plan? Kill him, then slaughter all his followers? And after that, round up everything in the wilderness as our food supply?” 
Scarlett was struck speechless. 
She had originally just wanted to deal with Lin Tian for her revenge, perhaps kill a few of his close followers. 
But now, after hearing Gallows speak, she wasn’t even sure what to do anymore. 
From the depths of her heart, she despised that goblin. 
The others felt similarly, each remaining silent. 
“I’m asking you all a question! Or… do all of you have something to say to me?!” Gallows demanded with a twisted scowl, his bloodshot eyes bulging menacingly. 
It was like a blatant, open threat. 
The Demon King of Wrath, Hir, shot back coldly, “Don’t you dare show me that disgusting face! I’m not afraid of you!” 
“Crack!” 
Her fists clenched, knuckles popping. 
The atmosphere became like a ticking bomb, ready to ignite at any moment! 
The Demon King of Gluttony continued to devour his meal but showed signs of agitation as well, cutting the meat with intense force. He was always ravenous, hence his gaunt frame. 
The Demon King of Greed, however, sat in composed silence, watching with a mocking smile. 
And the Demon King of Sloth was still fast asleep. 
At last, Scarlett broke the tension. “Enough, we’re all on the same side. This goblin is a threat to the stability of the Uninhabited Zone. So, I propose that we kill him and suppress the wilderness, just as we did over a thousand years ago.” 
A thousand years ago, the Uninhabited Zone had already “cleansed” the wilderness. 
They had killed, burned, and destroyed powers. 
The aim was to prevent any strong human forces from rising there, avoiding the threat of being attacked from both sides. 
Since that cleansing, the wilderness had been left in ruins, no longer a threat to anyone. 
And that was why it was known as the “wilderness.”
