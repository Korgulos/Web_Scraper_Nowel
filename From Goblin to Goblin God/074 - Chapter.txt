Chapter 74: The Lord’s Coronation Ceremony, First Declaration 
TL: Sungmin  
Lin Tian emerged from her dream, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He hadn’t expected it to be so exhausting. 
But at least, he had thoroughly dealt with this Sword Saintess. 
In a dream, those with weak wills couldn’t distinguish between reality and illusion. 
In reality, when we dream, it always feels very real, especially when dreaming of falling off a cliff or dropping from a height. 
The whole person would be jolted awake with fright. 
If it had been the former Sword Saintess, she certainly could have noticed something was wrong, but in this state, there was no possibility. 
“From now on, you shall no longer be called the Sword Saintess.” 
Lin Tian looked at her sleeping form and gave a cold smile. 
Moments ago, her face had been filled with the expressions of a nightmare, but now it was very peaceful. 
To be safe, he secretly added another layer of the Blood of Ruin on her. 
She must not regain her holy powers. 
The next day. 
Alicenia woke up slowly, her emotions much more stable than before. 
However, the once resolute and sacred look in her eyes now sent chills down one’s spine, like an exposed sword. 
Any carelessness and one would be hurt by her. 
Seeing she seemed very hungry, Lin Tian brought some roasted meat and fruits, “Eat, we need to complete the mission bestowed upon us by God…” 
Stunned! 
Alicenia’s expression shook, looking at him in astonishment, “How do you know? Are you the messenger?” 
She thought she had just had a dream, believing it was a conversation with God. 
But now, she was absolutely certain! 
The messenger God mentioned by her side was this goblin! 
“Shh, divine will must not be revealed…” 
Lin Tian said, putting on an air of mystery, and prepared to leave after placing the food down. 
However, Alicenia stopped him, “Wait a moment, what should I do next?” 
“I will tell you when the time comes.” 
Then, 
Lin Tian found Ifreya, who was with Gobu Yue and the others, “How come you’re only level 60? Your overall score is barely a thousand…” 
“Master, I’m sorry, I will strive to improve.” 
Ifreya knelt on the ground like a reprimanded dog, quickly apologizing. 
Lin Tian stroked her fragrant soft hair and asked, “How long have you been learning magic?” 
“I only studied for a year before following my senior out for training, there is still much I haven’t learned…” Ifreya explained. 
That senior was Loder. 
Lin Tian was slightly surprised, this meant her talent was quite good. 
Worth continuing to cultivate. 
He then gathered all the goblins, “You all must have been idle for a while, want to plunder some treasures, women, and food?” 
“Boss, absolutely!” Gobu Kuang spoke up first. 
The other goblins were even more restless. 
Looking at these five thousand small goblins, over a thousand big variants, and a hundred hero variants, Lin Tian began to feel like a ruler. 
Because they had enough resources and means to improve their strength. 
Overall, their strength was much higher than the normal scale. 
Plus, with the Sword Saintess, there was no problem repelling the ten-thousand elite soldiers from before. 
However, this time their opponents were much weaker than those ten thousand soldiers. 
A human city a few hundred miles from the Great Tomb, ‘Clinforth’. 
He had already scouted it, it could be easily taken down. 
Lin Tian then ordered, “Alright, then put on your equipment, we’re setting off immediately!” 
The goblins’ nature was to plunder, kill, and indulge in desires. 
Being cooped up here, even Lin Tian was getting restless. 
It was time to have some fun. 
“Clinforth, are we going to slaughter them?” 
Nearby, Alicenia had already put on the clothes and equipment prepared for her and asked. 
She was now dressed in pitch-black rusty armor, emitting an aura of evil blackness, contrasting starkly with her pure and holy face. 
But the cold murderous intent in her eyes was her true nature now. 
Lin Tian nodded, “Are you prepared for that?” 
“Naturally, I am prepared for the mission of God. Those damned and detestable demons brought me ten years of suffering…” 
Alicenia clenched her fists tightly, filled with hatred as she recalled the hardships she endured since becoming the Sword Saintess. 
Now, she no longer cared about any responsibilities. 
It was time for revenge. 
Lin Tian arranged the battle plan for this operation and instructed Ifreya, “You follow me, I’ll take you to get some magic books, understand?” 
“Thank you immensely, my great master.” Ifreya bowed and said firmly. 
According to intelligence, Clinforth’s lord was a white-hat mage, far stronger than those gray-hat mages before. 
As a mage, he surely had many magic books, which was why Lin Tian chose to attack here. 
In the hierarchy of mages, there were the levels of Mage Apprentice, Mage, Grand Mage, Gray Hat, Purple Hat, White Hat, Archmage, and Grand Archmage. 
The army was ready to set off. 
Lin Tian rode at the front on a dragon, commanding thousands of goblins to advance! 
This time, almost everyone was mobilized, leaving only Gobu Shan and a small group of goblins back at the tribe. 
He needed to wait for news from the cannibal eagle and be ready to appoint the Southern Lord at any moment. 
“Boss, I just remembered, didn’t the Great Tomb sign some sort of contract with the church?” Gobu Tian flew to Lin Tian at this moment. 
He had evolved into a leader variant, and his intelligence had greatly increased. 
Not only him, but the entire tribe of goblins, even the low-level ones, were nearly as intelligent as normal humans. 
Lin Tian had established a diet that included no raw meat, but plenty of nuts, vegetables, and fish, all beneficial for brain development. 
“The Great Tomb has already broken ties with the church, don’t worry.” 
Lin Tian said. 
He was already a habitual offender, so why fear this? 
Most importantly, he wanted Alicenia to massacre the city, to show the Lionheart Empire what their Guardian Holy Sword had become. 
… 
Clinforth. 
It was actually a city named after the castle in its center. 
It was a large town with over twenty thousand residents, including many adventurers and soldiers. 
The hottest topic in the city was the Sword Saintess giving birth to a goblin and then escaping and disappearing. 
Inside the castle. 
A banquet was in progress. 
On a long rectangular table covered with a red cloth were various delicious dishes. 
Seated on both sides were over a dozen noble scions with refined manners. 
At the head of the table sat an elderly man with a serious and solemn expression, the White Hat Mage, Clin. 
He slowly cut a piece of tender beef with a knife, eating as he spoke, “The empire’s scouts have reported that they predict the Sword Saintess might be in our city, did you know?” 
In front of him were his offspring and close friends. 
Unfortunately, they all shook their heads. 
They spent their days in pleasure and leisure, paying no mind to such matters. 
Hearing this, a little girl with purple curly hair spoke up, “Grandfather, I heard that the Sword Saintess was defiled by a goblin and is now raising the goblin’s child, is that true?” 
Her name was ‘Avril,’ Clin’s granddaughter. 
Not yet sixteen, she was already a Purple Hat Mage, a prodigy. 
The other direct descendants envied her deeply. 
For the future inheritor of Clinforth would undoubtedly be Avril. 
At this moment, a richly dressed middle-aged man interrupted, “Avril, you’re too young to be concerned with these things.” 
“Father, what’s wrong with it? Saint Jeanne of the Faroia Empire led her people to liberation from slavery at seventeen!” Avril spoke like a little adult, full of pride. 
The middle-aged man was about to scold her when Clin interrupted, “Avril’s concern for the empire will make her a good inheritor of Clinforth, and I can entrust it to her with peace of mind.” 
In the Lionheart Empire, sixteen was already considered an adult. 
And Avril would be sixteen the day after tomorrow, which was also the day she would inherit the lordship of Clinforth. 
The proposal had already been submitted to the Lionheart Emperor and received approval. 
After all, a Purple Hat Mage in her teens deserved it, especially as Clin’s granddaughter. 
“As for the Sword Saintess, hmph, don’t follow her example. She desecrated her holy office by raising a goblin in the church. Though I had some rapport with her before, I can’t condone such actions. It’s an offense to both man and God!” 
Clin swallowed the beef and sighed deeply. 
Avril sneered, “So she’s a whore. If I see her, I’ll certainly teach her a lesson.” 
“Avril! You’ve gone too far!” 
Suddenly, her father stood up, the sound of clattering dishes ringing harshly! 
The atmosphere grew tense. 
But Avril just gave her father a sideways glance, “Did I say anything wrong? Don’t treat me like a child, rest up and don’t strain your back.” 
Compared to her, her father had a mediocre aptitude, barely comprehending magic, and had wasted most of his life. 
Under everyone’s gaze, he could only storm off in anger. 
Clin continued to dote on her, “Calling her a whore isn’t wrong, but teaching her a lesson isn’t necessary. Report it to the scouts, and she’ll face judgment.” 
“I understand, Grandfather, you’re the best, unlike Father who only gets angry.” Avril grinned, showing her white rabbit teeth. 
Clin laughed, “Eat up, rest well for the next few days, and prepare to become the lord!” 
Time flew by. 
Three days later. 
On the castle plaza of Clinforth, a long red carpet was laid out, flanked by armored soldiers. 
Flowers, music, everything was in place. 
The plaza was crowded with residents, many holding flowers and cheering in celebration. 
“Long live Lord Avril!” 
“With the Clin family protecting us, we’re honored!” 
“Such a beautiful young lady, probably the youngest lord ever. I envy her future husband.” 
“Watch your mouth. But honestly, so beautiful and powerful, it’s enviable.” 
As the majestic music played! 
Avril, in a purple and white rose gown and with her straight hair styled, looked especially stunning. 
Her youthful innocence added a layer of untouchable holiness. 
She smiled, revealing her two white rabbit teeth, and walked slowly to the front of the plaza. 
Clin held a golden lord’s badge, smiling as he watched her approach. 
He couldn’t stop smiling with joy. 
Avril stood before him, ready for the ceremony. 
As the badge was placed on her, she became the lord of the town, the youngest female lord in history! 
Cheers erupted! 
Avril, excited, said, “Thank you all for your love! I will do better than Grandfather, ensuring happier lives for everyone! And I promise never to desecrate my holy office like the Sword Saintess!” 
Mention of the Sword Saintess made the crowd’s expressions change. 
Most cursed, while some felt pity. 
“We believe in you, Lord Avril!” 
“Long live! I want to be Lady Avril’s dog!” 
“My Avril, my Avril (sobs).” 
Avril continued, “If anyone finds her, report it immediately. Her crimes are growing, and the church and empire will punish her! Justice will be served to the people!” 
Blasphemy, in a theocratic era, was a crime warranting death to entire families. 
Daring to defy could mean death to ten families. 
Since the goblin incident in the imperial city, the Sword Saintess had been the focus of public outrage. 
“Hahaha, just taking office and already thinking of Clinforth and the empire, my good granddaughter!” 
Clin couldn’t help but smile with satisfaction. 
From a distance in the sky, Lin Tian observed everything in the city. 
He sneered, “Keeping up with current events, I see. The new lord’s first declaration is to capture the Sword Saintess for the nation. Very well, you’ll see her soon enough.”
