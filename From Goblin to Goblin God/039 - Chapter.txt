Chapter 39: Goblin Slayer’s True Identity! 
TL: Sungmin 
“Goblin King?!!!” 
Hearing these words, Lin Tian almost felt his brain shrink. 
The woman in front of him was the Goblin King? What nonsense! 
Seeing his exaggerated reaction, Goblin Slayer smiled lightly. “Just teasing you. Do you want to know my true identity? Follow me to the grove for a more… intimate conversation, and I’ll tell you.” 
Lin Tian’s intuition told him that this woman was terrifying and definitely not someone to mess with! 
Going into the grove? 
He estimated that she might eat him alive; after all, she had just eaten a person. 
“I know what you’re afraid of. Yes, I am the Goblin Slayer. I love hunting powerful goblins and mating with them. After mating, I kill them! 
It’s been almost ten years, and I haven’t met a goblin worthy of me. But you, you have that qualification.” 
Goblin Slayer spoke seriously, her eyes again revealing a surging desire. 
She was like a succubus. 
Lin Tian swallowed hard, but this woman’s identity was too complicated and unknown. 
Mating was fine, but he had to poison her first. 
Goblin Slayer continued, “Although you are in the form of a low-level goblin, you possess wisdom comparable to a Goblin King. It really excites me! Please, agree to this. Give yourself to me! Let me possess you!” 
As she spoke, she began to move towards Lin Tian. 
“Damn, is she crazy or doing this on purpose?” 
Lin Tian was so frightened that he kept retreating. He didn’t want to get touched by this thorny rose. 
What kind of woman would act like this? 
And she was such a beautiful woman. 
Lin Tian didn’t even need a mirror to know that no woman would like a hideous pig like him. 
Goblin Slayer’s longing and pleading eyes stared at him intently. She added, “I promise I won’t kill you after mating. I’ll stay with you. I want to see what kind of being you will become! Come on, my dear!” 
As she spoke, she began to chase Lin Tian. 
The remaining big goblins around hesitated, wanting to help but deeply fearing this woman. 
“It’s so embarrassing, being liked by such a beautiful woman but not daring to make a move!” 
Lin Tian was almost in tears. He and the goblin circled around the small flying dragon, dodging like Qin chasing the King. 
“Give me! Give me! Let me possess every inch of you!” Goblin Slayer shouted excitedly from behind. 
Her eyes had turned into heart shapes! 
From a distance, Lia and the others approached, confused. “Boss, what’s going on?” 
“What are you standing there for? Help me! This woman is crazy!” 
Lin Tian hurriedly called for help. 
Seeing the situation, Lia felt a bit awkward. “But Boss, you don’t seem to be in any danger? Isn’t mating with other species what you love? Just try it.” 
At this time, Gobu Shan and Gobu Kuang had already woken up. 
Seeing that calling Lia was useless, Lin Tian shouted, “You guys, quickly stop this human for me!” 
“Boss! Don’t harm my master! Come at me if you have to!” 
Gobu Kuang woke up, shook his head vigorously, and rushed over as soon as he saw the situation! 
Hearing this, Lin Tian felt a bit displeased. Even if he had to die, he couldn’t let this big fool have it easy. 
However, Gobu Kuang, who had rushed up, suddenly froze. 
He stood there mechanically, not moving. 
Even Gobu Shan and Gobu Tian, who had gotten up, did the same. 
Lin Tian sensed something was wrong, very wrong. “What are you idiots standing there for? Are you all brainless?” 
“Don’t bother. They’re under my control now, hehe!” 
Goblin Slayer even let out a villainous laugh! 
Lin Tian was on the verge of tears. He understood now; he had become the victim, right? 
Not long after, he was exhausted. 
Goblin Slayer caught him and hugged him tightly. 
“Damn it, you crazy woman, what do you want?” 
Lin Tian struggled hard, but he feared she would use the same method she had on Gobu Shan and the others. He couldn’t withstand that. 
He didn’t dare to really fight back. 
But looking at the loving hearts in her beautiful green eyes and feeling her hot breath, he felt she truly had no ill intentions. 
No, it should be full of ill intentions. 
But this ill intention didn’t feel malicious to Lin Tian. Who would think a beautiful woman wanting to ravish you was malicious? 
“Got you, my adorable little thing.” 
Goblin Slayer hugged Lin Tian and dragged him into the grove. 
In front of him, she began to remove her armor. 
She revealed her white body wrapped in mysterious white bandages. 
Lin Tian’s own desires began to burn, but he still asked, “Are you serious, beautiful?” 
For the first time, he hesitated in front of a beautiful woman. 
Goblin Slayer didn’t say a word and entwined herself with Lin Tian. 
Outside the bushes. 
Lia and the others, including Cecil and the barely alive adventurers, were dumbfounded, listening to the rhythmic, soft moans! 
They had been fighting fiercely, but how did it turn into this? 
Their jaws almost dropped to the ground, even their upper jaws were about to fall off. 
“No way, why would Goblin Slayer do this?! And she’s such a beautiful woman too!” 
Cecil held his head from a distance, completely unable to understand. 
Having lived in the capital for so long, what beautiful women hadn’t he seen? None compared to this Goblin Slayer. 
This development seemed completely abnormal. 
More like a beast, no, more like a goblin! 
Desire above all else! 
In the bushes, Lin Tian couldn’t help but reveal a satisfied and smug smile. “Hmph, no matter how strong you are, if you’re under my control, you’ll just become an obedient puppet!” 
But as time went on. 
He realized something was wrong! 
It seemed like the one being controlled was Lin Tian himself, not Goblin Slayer! 
Logically, the other party should become weak, with muddled consciousness, obeying his every command and cooperating with all actions. 
But now, Lin Tian was the one in that state! 
Outside the bushes, everyone waited nervously. 
After about an hour. 
Finally, there was a rustling sound from the bushes, and someone came out. 
It was Goblin Slayer, fully dressed in her armor, her face flushed and radiant. 
She was satisfied as she picked up her helmet and sword. 
Seeing this, Lia and the others leaped to the bushes, only to find Lin Tian lying helplessly on the ground. 
Around him was a mess of unspeakable sticky substances. 
“Boss, what happened to you? It’s the first time I’ve seen you down like this!” 
Lia said in surprise, quickly helping Lin Tian up. 
Faced with her question, Lin Tian was too embarrassed to say, “Just a mistake, keep an eye on that guy, I have a lot to ask her!” 
How could he possibly admit what had happened? 
He felt he had been raped! 
He was the victim! 
He was the one being controlled! 
What the hell was going on! 
Obviously, he had sex with a beautiful woman who hit his sweet spot, but the result was utter humiliation! 
At this moment, Goblin Slayer stood there without any intention of leaving. Seeing Lin Tian come out, she smiled, “Hello, my dear~” 
“You!” 
Lin Tian’s face twitched a few times. 
Then he said, “Let’s go! And catch that guy who escaped earlier!” 
“Shush, shush, shush!” 
Several goblins rushed out and directly subdued Cecil. 
Gobu Shan also returned to normal, leading the group back to the cave with large skewers of meat. 
This battle had significant losses, all because of that crazy pervert. 
Fifty big goblins died. 
Fortunately, the hero variants didn’t die. 
Upon arriving outside the cave, Goblin Slayer still had no intention of leaving. 
Impatiently, Lin Tian asked, “What do you want? This is a goblin lair. If you come in, you do so at your own risk.” 
“I said I would accompany you as you grow. As for the consequences, as long as you can bear them, it’s fine.” 
Goblin Slayer spoke, tracing her finger over Lin Tian’s chest. 
Lia and the others glanced over, quickly turning their heads to avoid laughing. 
It was the first time they saw Lin Tian so embarrassed. 
Annoyed, Lin Tian said, “What are you looking at? Go inside and hide, don’t expose our location.” 
Soon, only he and Goblin Slayer were left at the cave entrance. 
In this situation, Lin Tian knew the cave couldn’t be hidden anymore. She probably already knew about it. 
Coldly, he asked, “Who are you really? What is that strange power? Why can you control my subordinates, and why did you just now… control me?” 
He hesitated on the last sentence. 
If there were people around, he wouldn’t have dared to say it. 
Goblin Slayer was silent for a moment, then said, “If I tell you everything, will you agree to let me follow you?” 
“Tell me first!” Lin Tian said impatiently. 
If she wasn’t valuable, he would have already fallen out with her. 
Goblin Slayer thought for a moment, then said, “My identity? It’s a long story. My mother was human and was captured by goblins, a particularly powerful goblin tribe. 
You can guess the result. 
She got pregnant and gave birth to me.” 
Hearing this, Lin Tian widened his eyes in disbelief, “You are a goblin’s offspring? But why do you look so human?” 
“That’s the unexpected part. I am the result of the Goblin King’s seed who violated my mother.” 
Goblin Slayer’s expression turned solemn. 
This was a sensitive topic for her. 
Hearing this, Lin Tian found it hard to believe. It was too outrageous to accept! 
The offspring of the Goblin King? 
What a joke! 
As a goblin for so long, he knew best. 
The higher the tier of the goblin, the lower the chances of producing offspring. 
Mutant variants could hardly produce offspring. 
Not to mention the top-tier Goblin King! 
The probability was lower than winning the lottery. 
Goblin Slayer said heavily, “I know you don’t believe it. Even I can’t believe I’m alive.” 
“But, hehe, I personally killed the Goblin King! Ten years ago, I was almost forced by the Goblin King. When he relaxed, I killed him with my own hands!” 
Goblin Slayer spoke, her tone turning sinister and terrifying! 
Like a goblin. 
She killed the Goblin King?? 
Though surprised, Lin Tian had roughly guessed that goblins had no ethical boundaries. 
And she could resist goblin’s special abilities, not losing action capability during mating.
